International Women’s Day is a global holiday celebrated since 1911 to honor women’s achievements and to call for gender equity. March is Women’s History Month, which has been celebrated in the U.S. since Congress designated it in 1987. Since 1995, every U.S. president has issued a proclamation declaring March as Women’s History Month, including President Donald Trump on March 6.
Google, another tech giant, removed many cultural holidays from its calendar last year, including Women’s History Month. After recent backlash, Google said it removed the holidays because manually adding hundreds of world holidays wasn’t sustainable, The New York Times and The Verge reported.

Loomer wrote in a Feb. 24 X post, characterizing MSNBC as left-leaning by inserting the Democratic National Committee’s acronym into the network’s name.

USAID is the federal government’s international humanitarian and development branch, and it’s been the target of misinformation since the Trump administration began dismantling it. The administration put thousands of USAID employees on administrative leave and fired others; some of these actions have been challenged in court.

Before MSNBC formally acknowledged its plans to cancel ""The ReidOut,"" The New York Times on Feb. 23 cited unnamed sources who described the cancellation as part of a restructuring by the network’s new president, Rebecca Kutler. 
On Feb. 24, other news reports said MSNBC would end several other weekend shows, including those anchored by Katie Phang, Ayman Mohyeldin and José Diaz-Balart.
CNN changed its morning news lineup, but it hadn’t canceled any shows as of March 7. The network said Jan. 23 that it would lay off around 6% of its employees because of programming changes. 
NBCUniversal, which owns MSNBC, received payments of about $95,000 from 2012 to 2019 from the Department of Veteran Affairs and the National Institutes of Health for media services. An NBCUniversal spokesperson said she did not find that money from either agency spent went to MSNBC. 
It’s not unusual for government agencies to purchase advertising time on NBCUniversal networks. The NIH, for example, ran a commercial in January and February 2020 seeking clinical research volunteers. It also paid for booth space at a health and fitness expo sponsored by Washington D.C.’s NBC 4, WRC-TV, in 2018 and 2019.

Their claims first focused on what USA Spending showed to be federal payments to PoliticoPro, Politico’s news subscription service aimed primarily at businesses.

USAID’s budget and spending records going back to 2001 show no evidence that the United States’ international humanitarian agency sent Pelosi or her vineyard any federal grants at all.
Searches of news archives returned no credible reports that Pelosi’s vineyard received money from the government, and required financial disclosures since Pelosi took office do not show a $14 million increase in assets associated with Pelosi’s Zinfandel Lane Vineyard.
Pelosi’s financial disclosures show she is paid an income by the vineyard, which also serves as her and husband Paul Pelosi’s second residence. The Pelosis sell grapes to other wineries; their vineyard does not produce wine. According to Pelosi’s 2024 financial disclosure, the couple made between $100,001 and $1,000,000 from grape sales that year.

"Larry Kudlow

It’s very popular.”,"stated on March 4, 2025 in on-air remarks:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/mar/06/larry-kudlow/is-elon-musks-doge-very-popular-thats-not-what-the/,,"As Fox News viewers waited to hear President Donald Trump begin his address to a joint session of Congress, commentator Larry Kudlow mused about what role Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency would play in Trump’s speech.
""I wonder out loud how much DOGE budget cutting will be in this speech, because actually it’s polling very well,"" Kudlow said March 4. ""It’s very popular."" Kudlow served as director of the National Economic Council during Trump’s first presidency. 
DOGE — the Trump administration’s cost-cutting agency, headed by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk — has put hundreds of federal workers on leave, gained access to sensitive federal payment systems and sought to shutter some federal agencies. Trump created the agency by executive order, and it’s part of the executive branch. 
Is DOGE as popular as Kudlow said? 
In a statement to PolitiFact provided through Fox News, Kudlow said he was referring to a Harvard-Harris poll taken on Feb. 19 and 20. The poll showed people believe DOGE is making major government cuts, but it didn’t measure sentiment about those cuts. Respondents reported they are concerned about the group’s access to sensitive information.

Meanwhile, at least six other polls conducted since mid-February show less support for DOGE. Two polls found public ambivalence about DOGE, and four showed opposition outpacing support. We did not find polls that showed overwhelming support for DOGE.
Harvard-Harris poll shows respondents agreed DOGE is making major cuts, but it didn’t ask whether people approved
The Harvard-Harris poll did not directly ask respondents whether they supported or approved of DOGE.
In one question, they were asked, ""Do you think there should be a U.S. government agency focused on efficiency initiatives, or not?"" Seventy-two percent said yes and 24% said no. But the question didn’t specifically reference DOGE.
In another question, respondents were asked whether DOGE ""is helping make major cuts in government expenditures, or not?"" Sixty percent said it’s making major cuts, and 40% said it isn’t. But this question did not measure respondents’ feelings about perceived cuts. 
Answers to the poll’s other questions suggested the respondents had concerns about DOGE. 
When asked, ""Do you think that DOGE employees should have access to all information on government expenditures,"" including Americans’ names, Social Security numbers, addresses and incomes, 58% said DOGE should not have such access.
And when asked whether the executive branch or Congress should control how the U.S. government spends its money, 58% said Congress. 
Two other polls show mixed results 
A CBS News/YouGov poll taken Feb. 26 to 28 showed split sentiments. When asked what they think of Trump’s efforts to cut staff at government agencies, 51% said they approve and 49% said they disapprove.
A slight majority — 52% — said Musk and DOGE have too much authority to cut the federal workforce, while 33% said Musk and DOGE have the right amount of authority and 15% said too little. And on the question of access to sensitive data, 52% said DOGE had too much access.
An Economist/YouGov poll from Feb. 23 to 25 also found public sentiment to be split.
When asked about the Trump administration's efforts to reduce federal agencies' budgets and staff, 43% said the efforts have ""gone too far."" That was a plurality, but it was neck and neck with the combination of people answering ""been about right"" and ""not gone far enough.""
This poll, too, had responses that offered warning signs about support for DOGE. 
When respondents were asked, ""How much influence do you want Elon Musk to have within Donald Trump’s administration,"" 16% said ""a lot,"" 24% said ""a little"" and a plurality of 45% said ""none at all."" And 57% said they were very or somewhat concerned that Musk would have conflicts of interest.
Four polls show Musk and DOGE to be unpopular
A Washington Post-Ipsos poll taken from Feb. 13 to 18 asked respondents whether they approve or disapprove of the job Elon Musk is doing within the federal government. It found 34% approval and 49% disapproval. The survey also found concern about DOGE’s access to sensitive information; 63% of respondents said they were concerned, with 45% saying they were ""very concerned.""

When a Quinnipiac poll taken Feb. 13 to 17 asked whether respondents approve or disapprove of Elon Musk playing a prominent role in the Trump administration, it found 42% approval and 54% disapproval. 
Quinnipiac also found 55% of respondents saying Musk has too much power, 36% saying his power is about right and 3% saying he had too little power.
An Emerson College poll taken from Feb. 15 to 17 asked respondents whether they approved or disapproved of ""the job Elon Musk is doing at the Department of Government Efficiency."" It found that 45% disapproved and 41% approved. 
Finally, a Marist Poll for NPR and PBS taken from Feb. 24 to 26 asked respondents whether they had a favorable or an unfavorable opinion of DOGE. The results were 39% favorable and 44% unfavorable.
Regardless of the poll, one group consistently showed support for DOGE and Musk: Republicans.
Typically, 70% to 85% of Republicans answered favorably to questions about what Musk and DOGE are doing, while less than 20% of Democrats answered similarly.
Our ruling
Kudlow said that DOGE is ""polling very well. It’s very popular.""
A Harvard-Harris survey found 72% said the U.S. should have a ""government agency focused on efficiency initiatives,"" but the question didn’t ask specifically about DOGE. And the poll found 60% saying DOGE is helping make major cuts, but did not measure support for those cuts. 
In six other polls, none showed overwhelming support for DOGE’s efforts. Four showed DOGE to be unpopular; two showed split public sentiment.
There’s an element of truth in Kudlow’s statement — based on party affiliation, Republicans surveyed largely saw DOGE and Musk favorably. But that’s not the case for the broader set of respondents.

Abrams, an attorney, is a voting rights activist. From March 2023 through the end of 2024, she was senior counsel for Rewiring America, one of five groups in a coalition that was awarded an Environmental Protection Agency grant. But Abrams did not ""head up"" the coalition and there’s no evidence she directly received any of the grant money.
EPA awarded a $2 billion grant for energy efficient housing projects 
Trump appeared to be referring to a $2 billion Environmental Protection Agency grant awarded in April 2024 to a coalition of clean energy groups known as Power Forward Communities to fund energy efficient housing projects around the country. A press release announcing the coalition included a phrase similar to language from Trump’s speech: ""A new coalition forms for unprecedented US housing decarbonization."" 
That coalition included Rewiring America and four other groups that came together in 2023 to apply for $9.5 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy funding. 
After what it described as a ""robust"" review process, the EPA awarded the grant under then-President Joe Biden.
Power Forward Communities said Feb. 24 it was beginning work on several projects including energy efficiency upgrades in Clinton, Iowa, a new apartment complex in Detroit, Michigan, and home renovations in Salem, Massachusetts. It said those investments would total about $539 million — or about 27% of the total EPA grant.

What’s Abrams’ connection to Power Forward Communities?
There’s no evidence Abrams directly received any of the grant money or that she currently leads either Rewiring America or the broader coalition. She is not listed on Rewiring America’s ""Meet the leadership team"" portion of its website, for example.
Her spokesperson, Joshua Karp, told PolitiFact Abrams did not have a role at Power Forward Communities beyond her position at Rewiring America. Power Forward Communities CEO Tim Mayopoulos told Politico Abrams was not paid by Power Forward Communities or involved beyond her work at Rewiring America.
""Stacey Abrams has not received a penny of this EPA grant,"" Mayopoulos said in the Feb. 24 Politico article. ""It was never the plan for her to receive any money from this grant. Power Forward Communities has no relationship with Ms. Abrams, other than the fact that she’s one of the people who have advised one of our coalition members in the past.""
In October 2023, shortly after Rewiring America announced Power Forward Communities’ creation, Abrams said in an X post she was ""Thrilled to be part of (Rewiring America) and the Power Forward Communities coalition.""
In an apparent response to the mention in Trump’s March 4 speech, Abrams said she stood by her energy work.

There were 16 U.S. outbreaks in 2024, with 285 cases across 33 jurisdictions, CDC data shows. The Texas child’s death was the first in the U.S. since 2015. State data showed it came in a county with one of the state’s highest rates of school-aged children who received exemptions from receiving one or more required vaccines for reasons of conscience. About 91% of all U.S. children have been vaccinated. The World Health Organization said the virus killed about 107,500 people worldwide in 2023.
That the news outlets used stock images showing unidentifiable children with measles is not unusual, particularly when reporting on health issues in which live photos are rare.
USA Today, ABC News and NPR all used different stock images provided by Getty Images to illustrate stories about measles. It’s not clear where the Fox News images came from, but we found the two stock images seen in the Fox video on other websites.
When patients consent to be identified or photographed, news organizations are more likely to use those images in their coverage. None of the Texas measles victims in Texas have been identified by state officials due to privacy laws. People with measles also would likely be in quarantine at home or being treated in a hospital, not sharing their highly contagious disease with journalists.
Public health and medical websites often use stock photos, older unidentifiable medical photos, or clip art to illustrate stories about various diseases, rather than photos of currently ill people.
The claim that the use of these images in stories about a current outbreak proves that the outbreak is not real is nonsensical.

But Mills didn’t say this. Mills’ spokesperson Ben Goodman told PolitiFact the statement is ""entirely false.""
""Further, the action described in the false statement is illegal, per the Internal Revenue Code. The Governor respects the rule of law,"" Goodman said.
Although there were news reports about verbal sparring between Mills and Trump, we found no outlets reporting that Mills made this statement.
The exchange happened during Trump’s remarks welcoming a bipartisan group of governors to the White House. As Trump talked about his Feb. 5 executive order that intended to ban transgender athletes from competing in women’s and girls’ sports, he called out Maine specifically.
""The NCAA has complied immediately, by the way, that’s good. But I understand Maine — is Maine here? The governor of Maine?"" Trump asked.
""I’m here,"" Mills responded.
""Are you not gonna comply with it?"" Trump asked.
""I’m complying with state and federal laws,"" Mills said.

The post’s claim originated in a Feb. 17 article from The People’s Voice, a website known for spreading misinformation.
""There is no evidence that the measles vaccine can spread to other people. It is not contagious,"" Raul Andino-Pavlovsky, professor of microbiology and immunology at University of California, San Francisco, told PolitiFact.
What is measles and why is it on the rise?
Measles is a highly contagious viral infection that can cause fever, rash, coughing, ear infections, pneumonia and death. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes and is especially transmissible among children, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2000, measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. after more than a year without continuous spread, a development that health officials attributed to a highly successful vaccine campaign.
But large measles outbreaks can occur when the virus crosses borders and reaches unvaccinated or undervaccinated communities, the CDC said. Increasing vaccine hesitancy rates contribute to outbreaks. 
In late January, Texas reported two measles cases in Houston’s Harris County. The cases involved two people in the same household who had traveled internationally and were not vaccinated.
As of Feb. 28, the number of reported infections had increased to 155 across nine Texas counties and eastern New Mexico, including an unvaccinated school-aged child who died after being treated at a Lubbock, Texas, children’s hospital. Of the 146 Texas-only cases, five people were vaccinated. The rest were either classified as unvaccinated or their vaccination status was unknown, the Texas Department of State Health Services said.
Measles and vaccines in Gaines County
Gaines County’s case numbers led all the other counties with 98 — not ""200 or 300"" as the Facebook post said — a 1,533% rise from the six cases it reported Feb. 5. On Feb. 14, NBC News said health officials' estimated that another 200 to 300 people were infected across West Texas — not Gaines County alone — but haven’t been tested.
""There are people who are in the process of being tested and evaluated for measles in West Texas but there are not 200-300 people waiting on testing at this time,"" Lara Anton, Texas Department of State Health Services spokesperson, told PolitiFact in a Feb. 27 email. ""We expect that the number of cases will continue to increase because the virus is highly contagious and 90% of unvaccinated people will get it.""
Anton said the department does not provide counts of suspected cases.
Gaines County’s public schools last year had one of the state’s highest vaccine exemption rates, with more than 17% of its students citing reasons of conscience for not receiving one or more required vaccinations.
The People’s Voice cited South Plains Public Health District vaccination clinics held Feb. 6 and 7 in Gaines County.  On Feb. 5, the Texas state health department confirmed Gaines had six cases of measles, ""all among unvaccinated school-aged children.""

But there is no information that suggests such vaccines would accelerate infection spread — it curbs it. Claims otherwise stem from a misunderstanding of ""vaccine shedding."" The Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine is a two-dose attenuated (weakened) live virus vaccine. According to the CDC, the virus causes a harmless infection in the vaccinated person’s body that causes very few, if any, symptoms. The immune system responds to the infection and the body develops immunity. 
Although it is possible for vaccinated individuals to ""shed"" the virus in their urine and stool, experts told PolitiFact the measles vaccine would not transmit the disease to other people. Anton told NBC News that all samples tested in the outbreak were identified as a known wild measles strain, not a vaccine strain.
Paul Offit, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Vaccine Education Center director, said the measles vaccine virus is ""too attenuated to be passed from one person to the next.""
Matthew Washam, assistant professor at Ohio State University College of Medicine’s Department of Pediatrics and co-writer of a 2024 article about measles vaccine shedding in children, said vaccines don’t cause outbreaks as the post said. 
""This shedding is not contagious to others, and does not lead to measles outbreaks,"" he said.
Live virus vaccines are not recommended for all people. Cancer patients, for example, and others who are immunocompromised may not have the ability to fight the virus, even in the vaccine’s weakened form. 
Andino-Pavolvsky said a small number of people who receive the vaccine may develop mild rashes, but they would not be contagious and would pose no risk to others. Philip Keiser, a University of Texas Medical Branch global health professor, told PolitiFact there’s no scientific literature supporting the notion that a vaccine virus shed from someone who is vaccinated would be transmissible.
""The MMR vaccine (measles, mumps, and rubella) is the best and most reliable way to protect against these serious diseases,"" Andino-Pavolsky said. ""It has been widely studied and is considered one of the safest and most effective vaccines ever developed.""

Bills recently passed by the state Assembly — one step toward reaching the governor’s desk — included reversing changes to test score benchmarks and requiring cursive and civics to be taught in schools. 
Another bill would require school boards to adopt a policy by July 2026 that prohibits students from using cell phones during instructional time. 
At a Feb. 19, 2025, press conference before his bill passed the Assembly, state Rep. Joel Kitchens, a Republican from Sturgeon Bay, said ""90% of the (school) districts in Wisconsin already have a policy"" like the one the bill requires.
During floor debate on the bill, Democrats argued the bill would take away local control from school boards. Kitchens has pushed back on that idea.

""What we really need here is a unified approach,"" Kitchens said at the press conference. ""We are saying to the school districts that we’re standing with you on this, because everyone agrees this is a problem.""
The 90% figure caught our attention, especially when there’s so much debate over a policy that might already be par for the course in most school districts. 
Is it true that the vast majority of Wisconsin school districts already ban cellphones during class time? 
Let’s take a look.
90% figure comes from DPI survey of 320 school districts
PolitiFact Wisconsin reached out to Kitchens’ office to ask where the 90% number came from. They pointed us to the Department of Public Instruction’s testimony during a Feb. 11 public hearing for the bill. 
The department referenced its annual Digital Learning Survey. About 320 of the 421 public school districts in Wisconsin participated in the voluntary survey for the 2024-25 school year, officials said. 
Approximately 90% of districts that took part in the survey ""already have some sort of restrictive cellphone policy in place,"" according to the department. 
Fewer than 10% of districts did not have a cellphone policy and left it up to teachers to decide how to manage cell phone use in their classrooms, the survey found. 
While about a quarter of school districts did not participate in the survey, the 75% who did respond still represent the vast majority of districts in Wisconsin. 
Cellphone policies ‘vary significantly’ by school district 
While the 90% number is solid, it’s quite vague when referring to school districts having ""some sort of restrictive cellphone policy."" 
The results of the Digital Learning Survey drills down into that 90% number. Of that 90% total, about 26% of districts allow high school students to use cellphones in common areas but not classrooms.

About 44% of districts apply that policy for middle schoolers, along with high school students. And around 21% of districts have a full cellphone ban at all schools. 
In its testimony, DPI noted cellphone policies ""vary significantly.""
""In general, middle and high schools tend to have some form of restriction, while elementary schools usually enforce a ‘no phones during the day’ policy,"" DPI said.
The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel also reported a sampling of districts’ cellphone policies at the beginning of the 2024-25 school year. 
Some schools require students to place cellphones in caddies before the start of class. Many districts allow students to use devices outside of class, like during passing time and lunch.
The bill also requires cellphone policies to have exceptions, allowing students to use phones during emergencies and threats, for example, or to manage their health care.
Kitchens, in his own testimony, said the bill was written ""as open as possible"" and that each district will determine how to best restrict phones and enforce it. 
Our ruling
Kitchens said ""90% of the (school) districts in Wisconsin already have a policy"" that bans cellphones during instructional time. 
The Department of Public Instruction cited that 90% figure when testifying about Kitchens’ bill that would require districts to have that policy.
While specific policies vary by district, that 90% figure includes districts that either fully ban cellphones in schools or prohibit them in classrooms.

We found other social media posts using the same precinct results to accuse Musk of hacking the election.
Setting aside the shaky logic of Musk hacking one precinct’s results in a blue state that Harris won by more than a million votes, it could seem jarring to see the Democratic candidate for president not win a single vote, even in a small precinct.
The screenshots showed accurate vote totals, but the results are not surprising or an example of hacking or fraud, experts told PolitiFact. They’re the result of a town with a large Orthodox and Hasidic Jewish population bloc voting in support of their rabbis’ endorsed candidates.

""This is not uncommon,"" Republican Jewish Coalition spokesperson Sam Markstein said. ""You can go back several years to presidential elections,"" and see similar results. 
A closer look at Rockland County’s election results show precinct 35 in Ramapo was not an aberration. Trump won 55.4% of the Rockland County vote, besting Harris by 17,663 votes.
In Ramapo, Trump won 80 of 122 precincts. Aside from precinct 35, Harris earned zero votes in four other Rockland County precincts: precinct 45 (Trump 90-0), precinct 84 (Trump 558-0), precinct 97 (Trump 494-0) and precinct 122 (Trump 23-0).
In several other precincts, Harris received one or single digit votes, while Trump got hundreds. In precinct 55, for example, Trump outpaced Harris, 986 to 2.
The 2024 Ramapo results mirrored its 2020 presidential vote. That year, Trump bested former President Joe Biden 528-0 in precinct 35. In the 2022 midterm elections, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul lost to her Republican opponent, Lee Zeldin, 408 to 24 in that same precinct, which also overwhelmingly voted to reelect Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., over his Republican opponent, Joe Pinion, 266 to 113.

Benjamin Rosenblatt, a New York elections data expert, said precinct 35 is in the village of Kaser, which is composed almost entirely of Hasidic Jews of the Viznitz sect. The village is surrounded by the hamlet of Monsey, which also has a huge Orthodox Jewish community, he said.
Rosenblatt said in Kaser, and other Orthodox and Hasidic Jewish communities in Rockland County, such as New Square, ""voters often vote as a bloc, to an extreme degree."" 
New Square has five voting precincts, including precinct 55, and across the five, voters chose Trump, 3,518 to 13.
The Jewish communities  ""will often vote nearly entirely for one candidate in each race, but may not vote for the same party in every race,"" Rosenblatt said in an email. ""For example, they may vote as a bloc for a Republican for President, but for a Democrat for State Senate or other local races.""
That’s what happened here, as well as in 2020 and in midterm elections, Rosenblatt said.

""These communities are often somewhat conservative, but the rabbis' endorsements play an incredibly large role in the communities' voting patterns, and that includes endorsements for Democrats in many races,"" Rosenblatt said.
An October 2024 Jewish Insider article described national Democratic and Republican party leaders heading to Rockland County to secure Orthodox leaders’ powerful endorsements.
Ira Sheskin, a University of Miami professor who tracks the Jewish population in the U.S., said his data shows in 2023 Rockland County had 109,900 total Jewish residents. U.S. Census data shows there were 340,807 total residents in the county.
Rockland County Elections Commissioner Patricia Giblin said the precinct 35 election results reflect the area’s longstanding trends. The Orthodox Jewish population ""has consistently and overwhelmingly supported Republican candidates in the past elections,"" she said.
The Board of Elections ""thoroughly reviewed the results and confirmed no irregularities, fraud or hacking,"" Giblin said.
New York State Board of Elections spokesperson Kathleen McGrath told PolitiFact that state voting machines aren’t capable of connecting to the internet and couldn’t be hacked, as the social media posts claim.
Each ballot cast has a paper trail and all ballots are kept secure in a bipartisan manner, McGrath said. County election boards conduct mandatory post-election audits to confirm the results before certification, she said.
Voters can choose straight-ticket voting or choosing candidates for different parties, so ""claiming results of one race should be reflective of another race on the ballot are ill-founded,"" McGrath said.
Our ruling
Social media posts claim 2024 presidential election results in one Ramapo, New York, precinct — where Harris received zero votes — is proof that Musk hacked the vote count.
The precinct is in a heavily Orthodox Jewish area, where voters often vote as a bloc based on their rabbis’ endorsement. That’s likely what happened here, experts say, and previous elections showed similar patterns. Biden received zero votes in the precinct in 2020. 
A New York elections official said the state’s voting machines aren’t connected to the internet and can’t be hacked.

On Jan. 20, 2021, Biden revoked a permit for the Keystone XL oil and gas pipeline. The project would have extended the existing Keystone pipeline to run crude oil from Canada to Nebraska. 
Construction was underway, with Reuters reporting that the pipeline was about 8% built, when Biden’s order halted its progress. 
Some people lost their jobs.
One day after Biden revoked the permit, TC Energy — the company behind the project — ""let go 1,000 workers in both the U.S. and Canada,"" WorldOil reported. Reuters reported that TC Energy told employees by email that it would ""eliminate more than 1,000 construction jobs in coming weeks.""
That’s the clearest number of job cuts we could find immediately following Biden’s decision — 13,000 fewer than the Facebook posts’ claims. 
We didn’t find a CBS News ""60 Minutes"" segment specifically about the jobs cut after Biden revoked the Keystone XL pipeline permit (the Facebook post alludes to the show). But another CBS News show and other outlets, including Reuters, Verify and PolitiFact reported on the decision. 
Estimates vary on the number of jobs the Keystone XL pipeline would have created
A 2014 State Department report found that spending on the Keystone XL pipeline project construction ""would support approximately 42,100 jobs throughout the United States for the up to 2-year construction period.""
That doesn’t mean the pipeline construction would have created more than 42,000 new jobs, however. The report specified that the term ""support"" encompassed newly created jobs and maintaining ""existing jobs in current or new locations."" 
Pipeline spending would have supported 3,900 total ""direct, temporary construction"" jobs in states the pipeline ran through, the report said. And approximately 16,100 jobs would be ""direct jobs at firms that are awarded contracts for goods and services,"" including construction. 
The report said that 29% — or about 12,000 of the 42,100 jobs over two years — would have been in Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas. It didn’t specify where other jobs would have been located. 
The larger 42,100 total also included jobs supported by ""indirect"" and ""induced"" economic activity. Indirect economic activity refers to construction contractors’ purchases of goods and services, the report said. Induced economic activity occurs when construction workers and the people who provide goods and services to those workers spend what they’ve earned. The report listed money going to ""ranchers providing beef"" for construction workers as an example of induced economic activity. 
The economic analysis firm The Perryman Group’s 2010 pipeline economic impact analysis for TransCanada (now TC Energy) estimated that the Keystone XL pipeline project would have created about 59,500 jobs each year of construction.
Two subsequent analyses — one in 2011 by Cornell University’s Global Labor Institute and another in 2012 by Regional Economic Models, Inc. — criticized the Perryman report. 
Those analyses said the report overestimated the Keystone XL pipeline’s U.S. financial impact by including money spent outside the U.S. and reporting higher-than-average job wages. 
The Regional Economic Models, Inc., report estimated about 16,000 to 36,000 Keystone XL pipeline construction jobs in the U.S. each year for two years.

After construction, the pipeline wouldn’t have sustained many permanent jobs
The State Department’s 2014 report predicted that when the pipeline extension was completed and operational, it would require about 50 employees in the U.S., including 35 permanent employees and 15 temporary contractors. 
""This small number would result in negligible impacts on population, housing, and public services in the proposed Project area,"" it said. 
The 2011 Global Labor Institute report said that ""based on the figures provided by TransCanada for the Canadian section of the pipeline,"" new permanent ""pipeline jobs in the US number as few as 50.""
Our ruling
Facebook posts said Biden ""fired"" 14,000 Keystone XL pipeline workers ""on day one"" of his administration. 
On his first day in office, Biden revoked a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline’s construction. The next day, the company behind the project said it would eliminate about 1,000 jobs. 
Various estimates said the project would create or support thousands of temporary jobs, and once completed, require about 50 U.S. employees. 
There’s an element of truth — about 1,000 people lost their jobs — but we found no evidence that as many as 14,000 did.

"Kevin O'Leary
stated on February 24, 2025 in an interview on CNN:",“We've never audited government for 100 years.”,"stated on February 24, 2025 in an interview on CNN:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/feb/26/kevin-oleary/kevin-oleary-shark-tanks-mr-wonderful-says-no-gove/,,"ABC’s ""Shark Tank"" star Kevin O’Leary said the federal government is ""all fat"" and said billionaire Elon Musk is ""not cutting enough.""  
In a Feb. 24 interview on CNN, O’Leary, a Canadian investor who calls himself ""Mr. Wonderful,"" said this about the federal government: ""One hundred years of never being scrutinized, never been examined, never looking for any efficiencies,"" he said. ""Finally, here's an individual who's willing to do it for free with extremely great executional skills.""
Since President Donald Trump tapped entrepreneur Elon Musk, he has been the public face of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The Tesla CEO, X owner and Trump campaign mega-donor went so far as to promote his cost-cutting efforts by wielding a chainsaw at a recent event.
When CNN host Laura Coates questioned the efficiency of what she called Musk’s ""thrash and burn"" approach, O’Leary said it isn’t possible to be surgically precise: ""You have to cut more because you just don't know. There's no way to do it. Remember, we've never audited government for 100 years.""
O’Leary is wrong. The federal government has conducted audits for decades, per federal law, and it has publicly shared the results. The Clinton-Gore administration also undertook a massive cost-cutting effort, but much of that followed congressional bipartisan approval.

""It is absurd to say that auditing has never happened,"" said Robin J. Kempf, an associate professor at University of Colorado, and a former inspector general for Kansas’ Medicaid program .
O’Leary did not respond to an inquiry for this fact-check.
Inspector generals routinely conduct audits, per federal law
In 1978, Congress passed the Inspector General Act in response to anti-corruption efforts that began after the 1972 Watergate break-in and cover-up that led to President Richard Nixon’s resignation. Agency inspectors general, from NASA to Homeland Security, were tasked with conducting independent and objective audits, investigations and inspections and with preventing and detecting waste, fraud and abuse.
Their findings are not secret. Inspectors general provide semiannual reports to Congress and immediately report to agency heads if they find egregious problems.
The Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency issued an annual report for 2023 that showed that work by inspectors general led to more than 4,000 prosecutions and identified nearly $93.1 billion in potential savings. 
The findings resulted in about 3,000 suspensions, reprimands and terminations for federal contractors and federal, state and local employees.
Trump fired 17 inspectors general during his first week in office. (He said he would install new ones.)
Separately, Congress in 1921 founded the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan, 3,000-employee investigative arm that examines the use of public funds, evaluates federal programs and policies, and undertakes other forms of federal oversight. (Until 2004 it was called the General Accounting Office.)
The office regularly produces reports on topics such as opioid addiction, affordable housing, and the federal response to COVID-19. On Feb. 25, the agency released its biennial High Risk List, which cited 38 areas of federal operations that have ""serious vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement, or in need of transformation.""
The agency says its efforts have produced nearly $759 billion in cumulative savings, or an average of $40 billion per year, over the past 19 years.
Congress also carries out oversight through its committees. These include making sure that federal programs are fulfilling their missions and working in a cost-effective and efficient manner, and investigating waste, fraud, and abuse. 
Government audits have found billions in fraud and suggested improvements
Here are a few audit findings in 2024:
COVID-19 recovery programs: The FBI wrote in January 2024 that the federal agencies found a combined $300 billion in fraud from pandemic recovery programs that  ""make the fraud the largest in history.""
Medicare, Medicaid, and other health and human services funds: The Department of Health and Human Services inspector general said in December 2024 that it had found $7 billion in expected recoveries resulting from investigations and audits conducted in 2024 and 1,548 criminal and civil enforcement actions. The inspector general posts its recommendations online, where they are publicly accessible.
Costs for lead service line replacement: The Environmental Protection Agency Office of Inspector General issued a report in October identifying nearly $1 billion in questionable costs and funds for lead service line replacement in the states. 
Audits are not only about money; some focus on how to improve federal agency’s missions. The inspector general audited the FBI’s counter terrorism program in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
Auditing experts said DOGE’s activities are different than typical government audits
Government auditing is highly structured and guided by standards for auditing and performance assessments established by the Government Accountability Office, Kempf said. 
""It is very focused on arriving at an independent assessment based on accuracy and a lack of bias,"" Kempf said. If Musk and DOGE are truly auditing, she said, ""we should be able to see the evidence that supports every conclusion and recommendation. There should be transparency.""

From the U.S. Agency for International Development funding, “10 to 30 cents on the dollar is what actually goes to aid.”
By Amy Sherman • February 5, 2025
""None of that is happening with DOGE,"" she said.
DOGE has faced lawsuits alleging a lack of transparency. Although Musk said DOGE’s actions are ""maximally transparent,"" White House officials have resisted providing basic information for weeks, including disclosing who is DOGE’s administrator. A day after a judge questioned Justice Department attorneys about who is in charge, the White House told media outlets Feb. 25 that Amy Gleason is the acting administrator of the U.S. DOGE Service. Gleason is a career official who has worked under presidents of both parties.
Ryan McDonough, an assistant accounting professor at Rutgers University, told PolitiFact that he doesn’t believe DOGE is ""claiming to conduct audits in accordance with government auditing standards.""
O’Leary in the CNN interview invoked a different model: the private equity playbook for cutting expenses by cutting ""deep"" and ""fast"" and then hiring back.
But this misses an important distinction: Unlike companies, which have a profit motive, the government isn’t a for-profit business. Although efficiency is important, its primary mission is to provide public services and deliver equal treatment to citizens. 
""One can always learn from other institutional arrangements, and private equity is good at cutting redundancy, focused on value creation,"" said Shivaram Rajgopal, an accounting and auditing professor at Columbia Business School.
Rajgopal said such a model has ""some value"" for government auditing, but ""moving fast and breaking things is not a great recipe for government, in my view.""
Our ruling
O’Leary said, ""we've never audited government for 100 years.""
For decades, inspectors general have audited the federal government, looking for waste, fraud and abuse. Their findings are public and accessible online.
O’Leary left people with the impression that the federal government hasn’t been audited for a century. That’s ridiculously wrong.

""Stacey Abrams stole $2 BILLION from taxpayers,"" one Feb. 19 Facebook post said.

The Facebook post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)
The claim stems from a $2 billion Environmental Protection Agency grant that went to Power Forward Communities, a coalition of clean energy groups, including one in which Abrams previously was a senior counsel. The grant, which the EPA awarded under then-President Joe Biden, will fund energy efficient housing projects around the country. There’s no evidence Abrams directly received any of the grant money or engaged in illegal behavior. 
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
Power Forward Communities consists of Rewiring America, Enterprise Community Partners, Local Initiatives Support Corporation, United Way, and Habitat for Humanity International. The group formed in 2023 to apply for the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy funding.
Abrams, an attorney, joined Rewiring America, one of the coalition’s members, in March 2023 as a senior counsel. Abrams did not have a role at Power Forward Communities beyond her position at Rewiring America, her spokesperson Joshua Karp said. She left Rewiring America at the end of 2024.
In October 2023, shortly after Rewiring America announced Power Forward Communities’ creation, Abrams said in an X post she was ""Thrilled to be part of (Rewiring America) and the Power Forward Communities coalition.""
Power Forward Communities and Rewiring America declined to comment on the record. Power Forward Communities CEO Tim Mayopoulos told Politico Abrams was not paid by Power Forward Communities. 
""Stacey Abrams has not received a penny of this EPA grant,"" Mayopoulos said in the Feb. 24 Politico article. ""It was never the plan for her to receive any money from this grant. Power Forward Communities has no relationship with Ms. Abrams, other than the fact that she’s one of the people who have advised one of our coalition members in the past.""
The $2 billion grant to Power Forward Communities was part of $20 billion in funding the EPA announced in April 2024. The funding came from the National Clean Investment Fund, part of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which was created under the Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2022 by congressional Democrats. 
An April 4, 2024, release about Power Forward Communities’ award said the coalition’s members would draw on their experience ""to build and lead a national financing program providing customized and affordable solutions for single-family and multi-family housing owners and developers.""
Power Forward Communities was one of three groups chosen for awards under the National Clean Investment Fund after a competitive review process, the EPA said at the time, that included reviews from dozens of federal employees and scoring of applications by expert review panels. The EPA advertised the plan for the program that funded Power Forward Communities in 2023, indicating it intended to choose two or three national nonprofits to partner with local organizations to deliver the funding. The grant opportunity opened in July 2023, and it received five applications, E&E News reported.

Patty Murray, D-Wash., warned her colleagues to proceed with caution before approving tax cuts for wealthier Americans.
The Republican budget resolution being debated, Murray said Feb. 20, is ""not about balancing the budget. We all know that. Because they don’t plan to reverse one of the biggest drivers of the debt: Republican tax cuts. Despite all the boogeymen the Republicans like to point to as driving the national debt, the reality is that the single biggest driver of our national debt since 2001 has been Republican tax cuts.""
Murray is accurate when it comes to tax cuts and the federal debt, but she’s wrong to assert that Republicans acted alone. 
A 2024 analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscally hawkish group, found that tax cuts were the biggest of four types of legislation that have added to the federal debt since 2001. Two other types of legislation trailed close behind tax cuts in fiscal impact: large stimulus bills and annual spending increases.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
However, the tax cuts were enacted not only by Republicans; when the laws were extended, much of the debt they spurred was also ratified by congressional Democrats, President Barack Obama, or both. In fact, of five tax cut bills enacted since 2001, Murray ended up voting for two, the first directly and the second by not objecting to the unanimous consent motion.
Tax cuts rank first among factors contributing to the debt since 2001
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget analysis examined legislation enacted since 2001 that had the biggest impacts on the federal government’s bottom line. The analysis did not factor in additional spending for mandatory programs such as Social Security because they were authorized before the 2001 cutoff.
The report broke down the new fiscal burdens into four broad categories: 
The biggest category was tax cuts, at $8.4 trillion. These included revenue losses caused by the passage of major tax bills in 2001, 2003, 2010, 2013 and 2017.
Next was stimulus spending totaling $6.8 trillion, to counter the 2007-2009 Great Recession, and to ease the economic fallout beginning in 2020 from the coronavirus pandemic.
In third place was $5.9 trillion in new spending to keep the government running, enacted outside of major stimulus packages, typically through annual bills
The final piece was $1.1 trillion in Medicare expansion, notably the 2003 creation of the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit. 
By this accounting, tax cuts accounted for a plurality, though not a majority, of the new debt created. The difference between first and second place was modest. 
Are the tax cuts solely because of Republicans?
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s analysis looked at whether the laws in question were passed by overwhelmingly partisan margins in Congress:
Republican President George W. Bush signed the 2001 tax law and it received near-unanimous Republican backing. But it also attracted a dozen Democratic votes in the Senate and 28 in the House. 
Bush also signed the 2003 tax law; this measure received only two Democratic votes in the Senate and seven in the House.
Democratic President Barack Obama signed the 2010 tax law after its passage in the Senate by an 81-19 bipartisan margin and in the House by a 277-148 vote that included 139 Democratic and 138 Republican votes in favor.
Obama also signed the 2013 tax law, after its passage in the Senate by unanimous consent, meaning no objections from any member of either party, and in the House with more Democrats voting in favor than Republicans.
Trump signed the 2017 tax law. Democrats did not vote for the bill in either the House or  Senate. 
In other words, Bush’s 2003 tax law and Trump’s 2017 tax law were clearly Republican-backed bills without significant Democratic support, and Bush’s 2001 tax law was substantially, although not entirely, supported by Republicans.

But two of the five laws, in 2010 and 2013, were signed by Obama and supported by a broad swath of Democrats in both chambers.
The 2010 and 2013 laws related to extending tax laws that originated under Bush. 
In a statement, Murray’s office told PolitiFact that the 2010 and 2013 laws were ""technically bipartisan"" but added that ""context is badly needed.""
""Democrats did not want to extend tax cuts for the wealthiest,"" Murray’s office said in a statement. 
The negotiations for the 2010 tax bill occurred during the Great Recession, and the 2013 bill negotiations occurred before key expirations of laws, known as a ""fiscal cliff."" The looming expirations gave Republicans leverage to include higher-income taxpayers as beneficiaries of the legislation, against Democratic wishes. 
Still, many congressional Democrats, and Obama, did move to extend tax laws that originated under Bush, effectively buying into their provisions. Murray ended up voting for both the 2010 and 2013 bills, the first directly and the second by not objecting to the unanimous consent motion.
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that in general, lawmakers expressed bipartisan support for the tax bills passed since 2001 and for the stimulus bills, the annual spending increases and the Medicare expansions.
The statement from Murray’s office said, ""Democrats strongly and emphatically opposed new tax cuts for the wealthy few — the bipartisan extension of those cuts was only accomplished as a part of tough negotiations with Republicans who in 2010 held tax cuts for middle-class families hostage during an economic crisis, and in 2012 leveraged a fiscal cliff to force the extension of these tax cuts. They are tax cuts initiated and passed by Republicans—they were also tax cuts protected by Republicans during bipartisan negotiations. The Republicans, not Democrats, own the tax cuts.""

A recent X post raises the question: What about both? 
First, a little context: Wisconsin residents will head to the polls April 1 for the next in our seemingly endless cycle of consequential elections, casting a vote for either liberal Dane County Judge Susan Crawford or conservative Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel to serve on the state Supreme Court. 
The winner will determine whether the ideological tilt of the court will remain skewed liberal, which has been the case since the election of Justice Janet Protasiewicz in 2023, or if it will return to a conservative majority, as it had been for 15 years prior. With such high stakes, experts believe the contest will produce a record-breaking level of spending, including from notable individuals and groups outside the campaigns themselves. 
X user Kid Riles pointed out one such individual.

""To all the Milwaukee Brewers fans who live in Wisconsin: The Chicago Cubs owner is bankrolling Brad Schimel,"" the post reads. ""Vote accordingly."" 
We periodically look at claims related to politics that are circulating on social media. So, is the owner of the Cubs really bankrolling Schimel’s campaign? 
Let’s take a look. 
Big donors give money to state parties, which transfer to candidates 
We’ll get the baseball trivia out of the way first. The Ricketts family, headed by billionaire businessman Joe Ricketts, owns the Cubs. Joe’s son Tom is the team’s chairman. 
A look at Schimel’s publicly available campaign finance reports does not show the Ricketts in his list of donors. 
So what gives? The explanation requires some knowledge of campaign finance law in Wisconsin over the past decade. 
The state’s campaign finance laws cap the amount that a person can give to a Supreme Court candidate to $20,000. But under a change the Republican-controlled Wisconsin Legislature made in 2015, political parties can receive unlimited donations, which they can funnel to their preferred candidates. (That change has ultimately benefited Democrats more because they have been able to raise more money.) 
A review of the Republican Party of Wisconsin’s campaign finance reports shows a Jan. 27, 2025 donation from Joe Ricketts of $500,000. After receiving this and other large donations from wealthy individuals, Republican party officials transferred nearly $1.7 million in three donations to Schimel’s campaign. 
It’s illegal for a donor to give to the party and say they expect it to flow to a certain candidate, meaning it’s impossible to definitively prove that Ricketts’ money was for Schimel. 
Still, this practice has become a tried-and-true way for donors to get around individual contribution limits — so much so that Schimel encouraged people to do it.  
At a Calumet County Republican Party event last July, Schimel urged those who could afford to give more than $20,000 to give to the state party instead, the Journal Sentinel previously reported, suggesting any money given after the Nov. 5, 2024 election would be transferred to him.
""If you want to give a lot more, you can give that to either of the state parties, and they can transfer it,"" he said. ""They can transfer that to candidates.""

CBS News and “60 Minutes” “replaced” former Vice President Kamala Harris’ interview answers “with completely different, and far better, answers, taken from another part of the interview.”
By Sara Swann • February 7, 2025
(The Wisconsin Democracy Campaign filed an ethics complaint in early February over this remark and others by Schimel, who is prohibited by law from personally soliciting campaign donations.)
The state Democratic Party has also made use of this playbook. In January, they received $1 million from billionaire George Soros; $500,000 from Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker; $490,000 from Milwaukee philanthropist Lynde Uihlein; $470,000 from retired software engineer Gloria Page, the mother of Google co-founder Larry Page; and $250,000 from LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. Weeks after receiving those donations, they transferred $2 million in three donations to Crawford’s campaign. 
Now, for the nitty-gritty: the X post claims Ricketts is ""bankrolling"" Schimel. The dictionary definition of bankroll is ""to supply money for,"" but it’s worth noting that Ricketts is not supplying the majority of the funds in this extraordinarily expensive race. 
ABC Supply owner Diane Hendricks gave $970,000 to the state Republican party in January, and Uline president Liz Uihlein gave $650,000. Even groups backed by Elon Musk have dropped a few million on TV ads and increasing voter turnout for Schimel. 
All told, spending on this election is expected to outpace spending on Wisconsin’s last Supreme Court election in 2023, which totaled more than $56 million and shattered national spending records. 
Our ruling 
A post on social media claimed Chicago Cubs owner Joe Ricketts is bankrolling Schimel. 
A review of campaign finance records shows Ricketts gave a large sum to the state GOP, which has alongside Democrats transferred money to preferred candidates in a well-known workaround of individual contribution limits — something Schimel has acknowledged outright. 
Thus, the claim is largely accurate, though it’s missing the context of that workaround, which means we can’t know with complete certainty that Ricketts intended the money for Schimel. 
Our definition of Mostly True is a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. 
That fits here.",True,,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/Chicago_Cubs_logo.svg/4e57730d79b0d9dfb38af234e963044a.jpg,Related

""That is why the Biden administration was pushing to get in as many illegals as possible and spend every dollar possible to get as many, because every one of them is a customer,"" Musk said. ""Everyone's a voter. The whole thing was a giant voter importation scam.""

We emailed the White House press office asking for evidence and did not hear back.

Biden stepped up immigration enforcement during the election year
There were historically high levels of illegal immigration during the Biden administration, but there is no evidence that Biden ""imported"" those people to become voters. Factors such as natural disasters and economic or political turmoil in a persons’ home country lead people to migrate.
Additionally, Musk’s statement ignored that the Biden administration removed and deported immigrants in the U.S. illegally, and it stepped up efforts in 2024 as he ran for reelection. (He dropped out in July.)
The Biden administration removed, returned or expelled more than 4.5 million people from February 2021, Biden’s first full month in office, to November 2024, the latest month with available data.
Illegal immigration has generally dropped since March 2024, and it dropped significantly after June, when Biden implemented a policy limiting people’s ability to apply for asylum at the southwest border. For example, there were more than 137,000 southwest border encounters in March 2024 and 47,000 in December. 
""Biden was trying to deport as many border crossers as he could, so I don’t see any evidence he wanted these people in the United States,"" said David Bier, an immigration expert at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""He campaigned as being anti-illegal immigration. He never courted their votes, and he could not court their votes because they cannot vote and do not vote. Saying ‘every one of them was a voter’ is as divorced from reality as anything you could possibly say.""
It takes several years for immigrants to become citizens
Federal law requires U.S. citizenship to vote in national elections, and would-be voters sign a form that attests under penalty of perjury that they are citizens when they register to vote. 
The citizenship process takes several years. 
""It takes on average five years in green card status before a person can become a U.S. citizen, so no one would instantly gain the right to vote,"" Michelle Mittelstadt, a spokesperson for the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, previously told PolitiFact.
Musk acknowledged at CPAC that it might take years for immigrants to gain citizenship, but it would be ""an investment that is guaranteed to pay off.""
Immigrants who arrive illegally have higher hurdles to clear before becoming citizens and voting. The Biden administration failed in its efforts to pass a law with a pathway to citizenship, and no such legislation is expected during the Trump administration.
Which party would have the ‘immigrant’ advantage?
There is no guarantee that immigrants who become citizens will vote, or vote for Democrats. Although the southwest border gets the most attention, immigrants who come illegally are not from Latin America only.
Mike Madrid, a Republican strategist in California and author of the book ""The Latino Century,"" said Republicans won the largest national Hispanic vote share in 2024 than in presidential elections in recent cycles.

By Samantha Putterman • January 24, 2025
Immigrants, including Hispanics, view the Republican Party as focused on economic issues and the Democratic Party as focused on cultural issues, Madrid said.
The New York Times documented a conservative shift among immigrants after the 2020 election. Its analysis of voting in 28,000 precincts in more than 20 cities found that immigrant-dense neighborhoods with large populations of Latinos and residents of Asian descent had a surge in turnout and shifted to the right. 
""There is zero evidence that immigration has harmed Republican Party prospects,"" Bier previously told us. 
Eligible naturalized citizens comprise about 10% of voters, Pew Research Center found in 2024. 
Voting by noncitizens is rare
There are incidents of noncitizens voting in elections, but they are sporadic among millions of votes cast in federal elections. Immigrants who cross the border illegally are typically looking for jobs and many are escaping poverty or crime — most don’t want to risk drawing government authorities’ attention by casting a ballot.
Voting by noncitizens carries high risks that include deportation if they are here illegally or incarceration. Fraudulent voter registration or voting by noncitizens often results from misunderstandings or errors. For example, some noncitizens accidentally register to vote when applying for a driver’s license.
Our ruling
Musk said Biden’s immigration policy was ""a giant voter importation scam.""
There is no evidence that the Biden administration was bringing in people illegally to cast votes. Government data shows more than 4.5 million removals, returns and expulsions during Biden’s tenure. Biden stepped up these actions during the election year.
It takes several years for immigrants to become citizens and therefore eligible to vote. Immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally cannot vote and would have to overcome hurdles to become citizens.

The social media posts pointed to the website, ""USDebtClock.org,"" which claims to track the U.S. national debt and other economic and government data. The website was registered in November 2008 by a company that keeps registrants’ names private. Internet Archive shows the page has existed since at least December 2008.
Among the website’s many colorful boxes of rapidly increasing numbers is a golden box labeled ""D.O.G.E. Clock."" The Internet Archive shows this supposed government savings tracker was added to the website Jan. 20, the day Trump took office.
On Feb. 21, one month into Trump’s second term, the DOGE Clock showed a total of $121 billion saved and counting. But the U.S. Debt Clock website doesn’t explain how it arrived at this number or who is maintaining the site — and its figures don’t align with what DOGE itself has described.
The debt clock site’s about page says it is not associated with any U.S. government agency and not affiliated with or funded by any political party, organization or lobbying group. USDebtClock.org says it’s also not affiliated with the physical National Debt Clock located in New York City or any other online debt clocks.
PolitiFact contacted the email listed on the website’s about page, but received no response before publication.
The U.S. Debt Clock also has mobile apps in the Apple and Google Play app stores that were created by Chrono Numeric Labs LLC, a limited liability company registered in Michigan.
The debt clock website includes sources for all its metrics, except its DOGE Clock. When viewers hover over the DOGE Clock box, text appears that reads, ""The Department of Government Efficiency Advisory Commission, the real-time savings objective from reducing government waste, fraud and abuse in federal government agencies.""
Department of Government Efficiency’s own numbers don’t add up
The Department of Government Efficiency’s website said Feb. 17 that its estimated savings from the government is $55 billion — less than half the total listed on the U.S. Debt Clock website.
But this $55 billion total doesn’t add up, according to the ""wall of receipts"" posted on DOGE’s website.
Initially, DOGE’s Feb. 17 data release listed 1,128 government contracts it says have been canceled for a total savings of $16 billion. However, one Immigration and Customs Enforcement contract was incorrectly valued at $8 billion instead of $8 million. After this error was fixed, the website’s receipts showed about $8.5 billion in savings.

As of Feb. 21, the site also listed about 100 real estate contracts, which, if terminated, DOGE says would save about $144.6 million.
DOGE has not yet accounted for the remaining $46.4 billion in savings it claims to have secured. The website says the contracts listed so far account for 20% of the overall savings, but that’s incorrect. The $8.6 billion in supposed savings accounts for about 15.7% of $55 billion.
An NPR analysis found that about half of the government contracts listed on DOGE’s website, accounting for $6.5 billion in supposed savings, haven’t been terminated. The contracts NPR confirmed as canceled accounted for $2 billion.
Adding to the confusion: Other unrelated ‘clocks’ supposedly tracking DOGE
When we were looking into this post’s claim, we found multiple websites claiming to track the taxpayer money DOGE aims to save. The websites, ""dogegov.com"" and ""doge-tracker.com"" both feature a ""DOGE Live Tracker."" Neither website is affiliated with the federal government or DOGE.
The website dogegov.com was registered Sept. 1, 2024, and doge-tracker.com was registered Feb. 3.
On Feb. 21, both websites said that the ""official"" amount of tax dollars saved was $55 billion, pointing to DOGE’s website as the source. According to DOGE’s X account, the online trackers said $51.7 billion had been saved.
Our ruling
Social media posts cited what they called the ""US Debt Clock"" and said, ""DOGE has saved taxpayers $64 billion dollars in just 17 days.""
There is no evidence to support this claim. The posts pointed to USDebtClock.org, but the website provided no source or explanation for its ""DOGE Clock"" counter with a rapidly increasing multibillion-dollar savings total, which had hit $121 billion by Feb. 21.
The Department of Government Efficiency’s website said that as of Feb. 17, the advisory committee has saved $55 billion. However, the data available on its site accounts for only $8.5 billion.

But that doesn’t always apply when it comes to categorizing people by their sex chromosomes.
""You either have XX or XY chromosomes,"" Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., wrote Feb. 20 on X. ""Those are the options.""
Most commonly, a person is born with two X chromosomes (female) or an X and a Y (male). But this is not always the case. 
Mace’s claim ignores the existence of several medical conditions, some first observed by scientists as far back as the 1930s. Genetic testing in the 1950s enabled scientists to link these conditions to various chromosomal abnormalities in which people’s sex chromosomes are neither XX nor XY.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
Mace’s office did not respond to a request for comment before publication. After publication, her office wrote in a Feb. 21 email, ""Barring chromosomal abnormalities, a person with a typical number of chromosomes — known as a euploid — has either XX or XY which determines biological sex.""
About 1.7% of the worldwide population has intersex conditions or differences in sex development — cases in which someone’s anatomy does not fit into male or female — according to a commonly cited review of medical literature published in 2000 by Brown University biologist Anne Fausto-Sterling. 
The conditions include: 
Klinefelter Syndrome (XXY): People with this condition, first identified in 1942, have an extra X chromosome. People with this syndrome are typically assigned male at birth; the condition can result in infertility, low testosterone and undescended testicles. It occurs in about 1 in 600 males. 
Turner Syndrome (missing or partial X): First identified in 1938, this syndrome occurs when a female is missing part of the X chromosome pair. This can cause short stature, delayed puberty, low sex hormones and possible infertility. 
Triple X Syndrome (XXX): The symptoms of this syndrome, also called trisomy X, can vary from mild — tall height — to more severe, including developmental delays. The condition, present in about 1 in 1,000 females, was first identified in 1959. 
Jacob’s Syndrome (XYY): A relatively rare condition with mild symptoms, males with this syndrome are born with an extra Y chromosome. It occurs in about 1 in 1000 males and was identified in the 1960s. 
According to a factsheet released by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, chromosomal variations ""occur in an estimated 1 in 1,500 to 1 in 2,000 live births, which amounts to approximately 200,000 to 330,000 Americans based on the current population.""

There are also intersex conditions that do not involve chromosomes because a person’s ""sex,"" according to scientists, is not easily measured by one factor. Chromosomes, gonads, hormones and genitalia can all contribute to a person’s sex categorization.
People born with de la Chapelle syndrome have XX chromosomes but can develop a penis, because a gene typically found on the Y chromosome gets moved to a new position on the X chromosome.
People with androgen insensitivity syndrome have male chromosomes, but don’t respond to their body’s naturally produced male hormones, ranging from mild to complete insensitivity. In cases of complete insensitivity, genetically male fetuses (XY), with internal testes and normal testosterone production could develop vaginas and be assigned female at birth. Partial and mild insensitivity can result in more ambiguous sex characteristics. 
Other conditions also result in ambiguous genitalia that do not fall neatly into a male or female sex category.
""A lot of other variations might be noticeable at birth if they cause other types of genital differences,"" Sylvan Fraser Anthony, legal and policy director at Interact, a nonprofit advocating for intersex youth, told PolitiFact. ""Others will be discovered, you know, not until later.""

Mace wrote on X, ""You either have XX or XY chromosomes. Those are the options.""

Although most people are born with either XX or XY chromosomes, science dating back decades shows some people are born with other chromosomal variations.

Musk has not issued such a policy. We searched news reports and Musk’s X account and found no evidence that he directed all federal workers to undergo drug screening.

Steinman called on the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, an advisory group tasked with slashing government spending that’s associated with Musk, to implement a policy of mandatory drug tests for all federal workers. Musk responded: ""Great idea.""

It’s also doubtful Musk could give such an order.

""Mr. Musk can only advise the President and communicate the President's directives.""
Regardless, a drug testing policy for federal employees has existed since at least 1986 when President Ronald Regan instituted it by executive order. The federal government can drug test workers as a condition for hiring, through random selection or based on a reasonable suspicion of drug use that includes cocaine and methamphetamine. And although 24 states and the District of Columbia permit recreational cannabis, the U.S. government tests for marijuana because it’s still federally banned. 
Refusing to take a drug test or finding drugs in a federal employee’s sample could lead to a range of actions, including firing. In 2023, the Department of Health and Human Services estimated that federal agencies collect roughly 275,000 urine samples annually.

U.S. and Russian representatives held talks in Saudi Arabia that included discussion of how to end the war in Ukraine, and Trump dismissed complaints that Ukrainian officials were not invited to participate.
""I think I have the power to end this war, and I think it's going very well,"" Trump said while answering reporters’ questions Feb. 18 at his Mar-a-Lago resort. ""But today I heard (from Ukraine), ‘Oh well, we weren't invited.’ Well, you've been there for three years. You should have ended it three years — you should have never started it, you could have made a deal.""
This clashes with the evidence that Russia sent a large invasion force into Ukraine in February 2022.
The notion that Ukraine ""started it"" — that the country is to blame for an invasion that has killed an estimated 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers and at least 12,000 Ukrainian civilians — sparked outrage in Ukraine and from its allies. 
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded that Trump ""lives in this disinformation space.""
Trump’s former vice president, Mike Pence, posted Feb. 19 on X, ""Mr. President, Ukraine did not ‘start’ this war. Russia launched an unprovoked and brutal invasion claiming hundreds of thousands of lives. The Road to Peace must be built on the Truth.""
After Zelenskyy’s comments, Trump piled on more attacks on Truth Social, claiming the Ukrainian president ""is very low in Ukrainian Polls"" and is ""a Dictator without Elections.""
In a Kyiv International Institute of Sociology poll conducted Feb. 4 to 9, Zelenskyy had a 57% trust rating among Ukrainians surveyed. That’s down from 90% in May 2022, shortly after Russia’s invasion, but up from 52% in December 2024. Ukrainian law bans parliamentary and presidential elections during a state of martial law, which currently exists. Zelenskyy has promised elections once martial law is lifted. 
We asked the White House for evidence that Ukraine had started the war and received no response.
Russia’s attempt to blame Ukraine is part of a longstanding argument that doesn’t stand up to scrutiny.
What happened in February 2022
As people were sleeping, Russian troops and tanks rolled into Ukraine and missiles poured down in what U.S. military analysts called the largest military operation in Europe since World War II. The attack followed weeks of Russian maneuvers that included staging a large-scale military exercise along Russia’s border with Ukraine that the U.S. estimated to include 190,000 Russian troops. 
News coverage, video footage and the United Nations noted Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in real time. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced it as a ""special military operation"" at 6 a.m. Moscow time Feb. 24, 2022.
""The purpose of this operation is to protect people who, for eight years now, have been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kiev regime,"" Putin said in a televised address, using the Russian spelling of Ukraine’s capital city. ""To this end, we will seek to demilitarize and denazify Ukraine, as well as bring to trial those who perpetrated numerous bloody crimes against civilians, including against citizens of the Russian Federation.""
About 500 miles and a time zone away, residents of Kyiv awoke to the sounds of explosions. In the small eastern city of Sloviansk in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, loud booms drove people from their beds in panic. Families packed belongings, swarmed ATMs and gas stations, and tried to flee the Russian invasion in cars, trains, planes and on foot.
How did the false talking point that Ukraine started the war begin?
To set the stage for the invasion, Putin had long denied Ukraine was even a country, falsely characterizing its history and culture, arguing the Ukrainians were simply Russians who needed to be brought back into the fold. 
PolitiFact recognized Putin’s lies justifying the Ukraine war as our 2022 Lie of the Year.
In 1990, Ukraine's parliament declared its independence from the Soviet Union, a call it repeated in August 1991. Ukraine gained its independence four months later. In December 1991, Ukrainians voted overwhelmingly for independence, and within days, the USSR dissolved. In 1994, Ukraine agreed with the U.S., the United Kingdom and Russia to exchange its nuclear arsenal, the world's third-largest, for security guarantees.
But the rush of post-Soviet history grated on Putin, analysts say.
Putin has served as Russia’s top leader since 1999, with a four-year period in which he was nominally No. 2 but was widely considered the country’s ultimate center of power.
He has long sought to establish the theoretical foundations for escalating the war in Ukraine, a country with about one-third the population of Russia and, before the war, about one-ninth the gross domestic product.
As early as 2008, Putin told then-President George W. Bush that ""Ukraine is not a country."" Since then, Putin has asserted that there is no such thing as a Ukrainian people separate from Russia.

By Caleb McCullough • February 5, 2025
""These claims were designed to deny the existence and agency of the Ukrainian nation,"" Erik Herron, a West Virginia University political scientist and author of the book ""Elections and Democracy after Communism,"" told PolitiFact in 2022.
Yet, the history of Ukraine has involved several empires or states, some of which were entirely separate from Russia, Eugene Finkel, an associate professor with Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies, told PolitiFact on the eve of the war.
Putin set the table for the 2022 invasion with a 5,000-word essay in July 2021. In it, he argued that much of modern-day Ukraine occupies historically Russian lands and that ""Russia was robbed"" of them.
Putin’s essay blamed the conflict on the West, claiming that the protest-driven ouster of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych in 2014, an ally of Russia, was engineered from the outside, and that the Ukrainian government elected in 2014 is illegitimate. 
Putin’s argument was that Ukraine was poised ""to join NATO and have NATO missiles placed in Ukraine and aimed at Russia,"" said Alexander Motyl, a Rutgers University-Newark political scientist. In Putin’s telling, ""Poor Russia was forced to rush to the persecuted Ukrainians' defense and forestall NATO-inspired Ukranian aggression,"" Motyl said.
In 2023, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev echoed Putin’s stance, saying that Ukraine is a part of Russia, but ""we live in different apartments.""
Soon after the war started, more than 140 scholars signed a letter denouncing Putin’s narrative as ""factually wrong, morally repugnant and deeply offensive to the memory of millions of victims of Nazism and those who courageously fought against it, including Russian and Ukrainian soldiers of the Red Army.""
As for Trump’s recent remark, it is a ""distillation of these Russian talking points,"" Herron said.
Our ruling
Trump said  Zelenskyy ""started"" the war in Ukraine with Russia.
On Feb. 24, 2022, Russian forces launched an invasion on Ukraine, a country that the night before was at peace. Putin called it a ""special military operation"" and he premised the attack on false claims about Ukraine. As people were sleeping, Russian troops and tanks rolled into Ukraine and missiles poured down in what U.S. military analysts called the largest military operation in Europe since World War II.
The attack followed weeks of Russian maneuvers that included staging a large-scale military exercise along Russia’s border with Ukraine that the U.S. estimated to include 190,000 Russian troops.

In her 2018 memoir, ""Becoming,"" she wrote that she would ""never forgive"" Trump for pushing the false claim that her husband wasn’t born in the U.S. Those allegations were ""crazy and mean-spirited"" and put her ""family at risk,"" she wrote.
Trump attended Carter’s funeral. He sat next to Obama and the two appeared to engage in pleasant conversation.
After Michelle Obama skipped both January events, social media users spread a baseless claim using artificially generated images that originally began as satire in 2014. That unfounded rumor said Barack Obama had an affair with former ""Friends"" star Jennifer Aniston, PolitiFact reported Feb. 5. Aniston shot down the rumor in an October appearance on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" saying it was ""absolutely untrue,"" as Kimmel held up a copy of the gossip magazine ""In Touch"" with the headline, ""The Truth About Jen & Barack!""
There is no evidence that the Obamas are divorcing. They have not publicly spoken about the rumors, but have shared recent social media posts declaring their love for each other.
On Valentine’s Day, Barack Obama wrote on X, ""Thirty-two years together and you still take my breath away. Happy Valentine’s Day, @MichelleObama!""

Michelle Obama, in her own Valentine’s Day X post wrote, ""If there’s one person I can always count on, it’s you, @BarackObama. You’re my rock. Always have been. Always will be. Happy Valentine’s Day, honey!""
On Michelle Obama’s Jan. 17 birthday, Barack Obama celebrated on X with a photo of the couple holding hands at a dinner table, writing, ""Happy birthday to the love of my life, @MichelleObama. You fill every room with warmth, wisdom, humor, and grace – and you look good doing it. I’m so lucky to be able to take on life's adventures with you. Love you!""
Michelle Obama responded by resharing her husband’s post, writing, ""Love you, honey!"" and adding heart and kiss emojis.

"Susan Crawford
stated on February 9, 2025 in TV interview:",Wisconsin does not “require judges to automatically recuse just because they have done some kind of legal work in the past as a lawyer.”,"stated on February 9, 2025 in TV interview:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/feb/19/susan-crawford/candidate-right-that-wisconsin-does-not-require-ju/,,"As the race for control of Wisconsin’s Supreme Court picks up steam, there’s a word you’ve probably heard: Recusal. 
Recusal refers to a justice’s decision to sit out a case because they have a connection to the lawsuit or lawyers that affects their ability to rule fairly. 
Dane County Court Judge Susan Crawford, the liberal candidate in the race, was asked by WISN-TV’s ""Upfront"" during its Feb. 9, 2025 episode if she should recuse herself from any case before the Supreme Court involving abortion. 
Crawford, as a private attorney, represented Planned Parenthood in challenging a state law that required physicians providing abortion services to get admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.
""The law does not require judges to automatically recuse just because they have done some kind of legal work in the past as a lawyer,"" Crawford said.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
Crawford’s involvement in the case happened about a decade ago: A federal appeals court panel found the law unconstitutional in 2015. 
Because recusal is bound to come up in the remaining weeks of campaigning, let’s take a look at what the standards are in Wisconsin. Legal experts will also explain why there are often gray areas.
Code of conduct requires recusal if justice served as a lawyer in the specific lawsuit
Let’s start with laying out what the Code of Judicial Conduct says about recusal, and if it mentions anything about stepping away because of previous work as a lawyer.
Here are just a few of the situations where the code says a justice should recuse. 
The judge was a material witness in the case.
The judge, their spouse or minor children have an economic interest in the case.
The judge’s spouse or relative is a lawyer in the case. 
But there’s another one that relates to Crawford’s claim: ""The judge served as a lawyer in the matter in controversy.""
Wait — does ""matter in controversy"" mean Crawford would be disqualified from participating in anything related to abortion?
That’s not the case, explained Charles Geyh, a professor at the Indiana University Maurer School of Law who specializes in judicial ethics. The ""matter"" refers to a specific lawsuit, not a broad issue. 
""You can certainly see where if you expanded it to include the issue, that would get crazy pretty quickly. Lawyers who are active litigators may be addressing bazillions of issue areas,"" Geyh said. 
Howard Schweber, a professor emeritus of political science and legal studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, noted many judges previously worked as criminal prosecutors or defenders.
""It would be absurd to suggest that those judges must recuse themselves from any case involving a crime,"" Schweber said. 
Recusal decisions exist on a spectrum, can lead to some grey areas
But sometimes it’s not quite so straightforward. Schweber sees recusal decisions as a spectrum. 
At the most obvious end is recusing because you’d make money if you rule a certain way. At the other end is recusing because of a philosophical belief you have. 
If a justice worked for Planned Parenthood on the particular issue in a lawsuit now before the Supreme Court, recusal would be appropriate, Schweber said. But simply working for Planned Parenthood is less so. 
""It’s unfortunately really quite difficult to be much more specific than that, because there’s an element of judgment involved,"" Schweber said. 
Crawford’s campaign provided much of the same background when PolitiFact Wisconsin reached out, citing a report on recusal from the State Democracy Research Initiative at UW’s Law School.
""Notably, Judge Crawford’s representation of Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin was not the same action that is now before the court. Recusal is not required simply for having represented a party in previous actions,"" her campaign said.
For context, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin has asked the Supreme Court to recognize a constitutional right to bodily autonomy, including abortion.
Schweber said working on a particular issue like the constitutionality of Act 10 would be a stronger case for recusal. ""It’s further down that spectrum of possibilities,"" Schweber said.  
Another way to look at the spectrum: Conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn recused from the current Act 10 case because he helped create the law and defended it as former Gov. Scott Walker’s chief legal counsel.
Crawford also addressed Act 10 in the interview — she represented teachers challenging the law. Crawford said she’d consider the parties bringing the lawsuit and which part of Act 10 is being litigated.

“Melania wins $900 million ‘defamation lawsuit’ against The View & Sunny Hostin.”
By Sofia Ahmed • February 4, 2025
Justices themselves ultimately decide whether to recuse, some have called for stricter rules
That gets into a second major idea that supports Crawford’s claim.
In Wisconsin, Supreme Court justices decide for themselves if they’d be biased on a certain issue and if they should recuse. The other justices can’t overrule their decision.
So, it would be up to Crawford to make the final call about whether to step away from a case involving a group she represented or an issue she worked on in the past.
""If you work for Planned Parenthood, you can assume that you’re not hostile to the goals of Planned Parenthood,"" Geyh said.
""But even then, there is no rule that says once you stop doing that and you put on your judicial hat, that you are somehow compromised in your ability to be fair and impartial,"" he said.
Because justices rule on their own bias, some have called for stricter standards. Geyh is on board with that idea but cautioned that partisan interests could ""manufacture"" new rules to get a justice off a case.
Crawford and her conservative opponent, Waukesha County Court Judge Brad Schimel, were asked by WISN if they would back imposing recusal rules for the Supreme Court.
Schimel said he would want to see what the rules would be before deciding whether to support them. 
Crawford said she thinks the current judicial code is a ""workable system, but I also welcome any opportunities to strengthen and improve a system like that.""
Our ruling
Crawford said Wisconsin does not ""require judges to automatically recuse just because they have done some kind of legal work in the past as a lawyer.""
Legal experts interviewed by PolitiFact Wisconsin agreed — it would be a slippery slope if justices weren’t allowed to participate in cases that broadly relate to their past work. 
The judicial code requires recusal if the justice worked as a lawyer in the ""matter in controversy."" That refers to a particular lawsuit, not a broad issue like abortion. But there can be gray areas.
Ultimately, it’s up to Crawford to determine whether she’d be impartial in a case, the same as any other justice on the bench.

Data show: 
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
The federal civilian workforce increased by 4.8% during Biden’s term — not by almost 50%.
There were about 2.89 million federal employees when Biden took office, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics — not 2.1 million.
When Biden left office, there were about 3.02 million federal employees, Bureau of Labor Statistics figures show. The count included about 600,000 postal workers who were not paid by taxpayer dollars because the U.S. Postal Service is generally self-funded. It also included congressional staffers and other employees outside the executive branch. It excludes the military’s 1.3 million active-duty uniformed service members, who are generally not counted among federal employees.
President Donald Trump oversaw a modest increase in federal government hiring during his first term, with a 2.6% increase in the federal workforce. There were about 2.81 million federal workers when Trump entered office in January 2017, and 2.89 million when he left in January 2021. 
Since 2000, the number of federal government workers has increased by 9.2%, largely staying between 2.7 million and 2.8 million until the count surpassed 3 million during Biden’s term. The number of employees briefly spiked every 10 years during the decennial censuses. 
And the numbers have been higher: From 1985 to 1994, under both Republican and Democratic administrations, there were more than 3 million federal employees. The number dropped by 11% during President Bill Clinton’s tenure as he implemented measures to streamline the federal workforce. 
It’s unclear where the incorrect 2.1 million figure came from.
The Office of Personnel Management provides detailed information on executive branch employees, which excludes postal workers, congressional staffers and intelligence agency workers. The number of people working in the executive branch was at around 2.17 million in December 2020, shortly before Biden took office. The number grew by about 5.5%, to 2.29 million in May 2024, the most recent month available.

During a similar window of Trump’s first term, from December 2016 to June 2020, the number of executive branch workers increased by about 3.2%.
Biden increased hiring at most federal agencies
Biden increased hiring in all but two Cabinet-level agencies, as well as at most independent agencies.
The departments that saw biggest personnel increases during Biden’s term were the State, Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs, Treasury and Energy departments, Government Executive reported in January. 
The Defense and Commerce departments lost workers.
Although federal employment ticked up during Trump’s first term, he cut staff at most federal agencies. Employment increased at the Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs and the Defense Department, offsetting cuts elsewhere in the executive branch, Government Executive reported. The Education, State and Labor departments saw the biggest employment cuts, all shrinking more than 10%. 
Trump has made slashing the federal workforce a top priority of his first month back in office. Trump’s administration terminated thousands of employees on probationary status Feb. 13, a day after a federal judge greenlit a buyout offer that the White House said 77,000 employees had accepted before it closed. Labor unions sued the Trump administration over the probationary employee firings. 
Our ruling
A social media post said the federal workforce ""was at 2.1 million"" when Biden took office and ""had increased to 3 million"" by the time he left.
The federal workforce grew by about 4.8% during Biden’s term, increasing from 2.89 million in January 2021 to 3.02 million in January 2025. Measuring just executive branch employees, the count increased by about 5.5%, from 2.17 million to 2.29 million.

stated on February 11, 2025 in a TikTok post:","Under the SAVE Act, “if you are a woman that has changed your name from your birth certificate, let’s say through marriage … you are no longer eligible to vote.”","stated on February 11, 2025 in a TikTok post:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/feb/17/tiktok-posts/save-act-would-make-it-harder-not-impossible-for-m/,,"Congressional Republicans are pushing to pass a bill that would require documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote. The move worries voting rights advocates who say it would hinder registration among eligible citizens.
The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, or SAVE Act, would set federal standards for voter registration. The bill lists documents people could use to prove their citizenship when registering to vote, such as a birth certificate or passport. The bill’s text makes no mention of a marriage certificate or name change document.
According to the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning voting rights advocacy group, more than 21 million voting-age American citizens — or 9% of eligible voters — don’t have ready access to documents to prove their citizenship.
Critics have also said the bill would make it difficult for a person who takes a spouse’s last name after marriage —overwhelmingly women in opposite-sex marriages — to register to vote. If someone lacks a passport with a current name, providing documents with the correct name would be more difficult. 
""If you are a woman that has changed your name from your birth certificate, let’s say through marriage and you took your husband’s name, you are no longer eligible to vote if this bill passes the Senate,"" said one TikTok user. 
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
That’s not quite accurate. The bill would make voter registration more difficult for married people who change their last names, and anyone whose name does not match the name on a birth certificate. But it would not prohibit it outright. 
The bill’s Republican supporters say the legislation is necessary to ensure that noncitizens don’t vote in U.S. elections. Federal and state laws already prohibit noncitizens from voting in federal elections, and cases of noncitizens voting are extremely rare. 
What the SAVE Act does 
The bill, a priority of House Republicans, would require people registering to vote or updating their voter registrations to use certain identifying documents, including military IDs, enhanced IDs showing citizenship, birth certificates or passports to prove  citizenship. 
The House passed the bill in 2024, but it stalled in the Senate. In January, U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, reintroduced the bill for the current Congress.
A passport alone would be sufficient to register under the bill, but a person who presents a birth certificate also would need a photo ID that matches the birth certificate’s information. About half of Americans don’t have passports, and the application process is expensive and time-consuming. 
For people who lack passports, any mismatch between their birth certificates and IDs would present problems with registration, Wendy Weiser, the vice president for democracy at the Brennan Center, said. Such a mismatch is common for people who change their names following marriage.
A Pew research survey found 79% of married women in opposite-sex marriages took their spouse’s last name. About 5% of men changed their last names after marriage. For same-sex marriages, Pew said the sample was too small to measure.
A 2006 Brennan Center survey found that 34% of women lack access to proof of citizenship with their current legal name. 
Proponents say one section of the bill addresses the needs of people with name changes. It directs each state to ""establish a process under which an applicant can provide such additional documentation"" to establish citizenship if the person’s documents don’t include matching information.
In a statement, Roy dismissed the criticism and argued the bill wouldn’t prevent people who have changed their names from registering to vote. 
""The legislation provides a myriad ways for people to prove citizenship and explicitly directs States to establish a process for individuals to register to vote if there are discrepancies in their proof of citizenship documents due to something like a name change,"" Roy said.

In a statement provided by Roy’s office, Cleta Mitchell, the founder of the Only Citizens Vote Coalition, said married women regularly have to provide birth certificates and marriage licenses in order to change their names for Social Security documents, bank accounts and other documents. She acknowledged the process ""is a pain,"" but said ""millions of women do it every day.""
Mitchell, a lawyer and former Oklahoma state representative, has pushed unfounded theories about voter fraud and worked on President Donald Trump’s campaign’s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.
But Weiser said the provision isn’t explicit enough to guarantee that something such as a marriage license would be sufficient to prove citizenship. The bill requires states to have a process to address discrepancies, but states could implement that in different ways. 
The flexibility is also undercut, she said, by another portion of the bill that would impose criminal charges on election workers who do not adequately vet someone’s citizenship on registration documents. A person who registers an application to vote without proof of citizenship could be subject to a fine and up to five years in prison. 
""Election officials are going to be very wary of subjecting themselves to criminal prosecutions just to register someone to vote if their proof of citizenship doesn’t clearly meet the statutory requirement,"" Weiser said.
Women who change their names after marriage already face hurdles to vote in some states that require voter ID, PolitiFact previously reported. 
Our ruling
A TikTok video said that women who changed their name after marriage are ""no longer eligible to vote"" if the SAVE Act becomes law.
The bill does not make women ineligible to vote if they have changed their names after marriage. But its documentation provisions could make voter registration harder for people who change their names and don’t have valid passports. The overwhelming majority of people who change their names after marriage are women.

"Elon Musk
stated on February 10, 2025 in an X post:",“FEMA sent $59M LAST WEEK to luxury hotels in New York City to house illegal migrants… That money is meant for American disaster relief.”,"stated on February 10, 2025 in an X post:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/feb/14/elon-musk/fema-did-not-give-disaster-relief-money-to-new-yor/,,"Elon Musk said his team at the Department of Government Efficiency, President Donald Trump’s cost-cutting agency, has uncovered illicit activity from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
""The @DOGE team just discovered that FEMA sent $59M LAST WEEK to luxury hotels in New York City to house illegal migrants. Sending this money violated the law and is in gross insubordination to the President’s executive order,"" Musk said Feb. 10 in an X post. ""That money is meant for American disaster relief and instead is being spent on high end hotels for illegals! A clawback demand will be made today to recoup those funds.""
During the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump made a similar claim after Hurricane Helene hit the southeast U.S. in late September.
""$1 billion was stolen from FEMA to use it for illegal migrants,"" Trump said at the time. We rated that claim Pants on Fire! 
Like Trump’s, Musk’s claim is inaccurate. FEMA did not give money directly to New York hotels; it did give money to New York City. That move was neither illegal nor secretive. It was part of a program that Congress created and funded using money from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, not FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund, which is primarily used after natural disasters. The money did not fund luxury hotel rooms for immigrants.

Here are the facts.
FEMA has funded states and organizations that help migrants since Trump’s first term
Since Trump’s first administration, FEMA has given money to help state and local governments and nonprofit organizations that provide immigrants with basic services.
In 2019, as illegal immigration increased, Congress gave FEMA funding to expand its Emergency Food and Shelter Program to include migrant support services to immigrants  awaiting court proceedings. The program previously had been used only for people facing homelessness and hunger. 
In 2023, Congress directed U.S. Customs and Border Protection and FEMA to create the Shelter and Services Program for migrants, removing immigration grants from the Emergency Food and Shelter Program. The Shelter and Services Program uses money Congress has given Customs and Border Protection, and is administered by FEMA.
In fiscal year 2024, which started October 2023 and ended September 2024, Congress directed U.S. Customs and Border Protection to give FEMA $650 million for the Shelter and Services Program. 
Neither program was, or is, funded with money promised to FEMA’s disaster relief work. 
""The Disaster Relief Fund has nothing to do with any migrant assistance account because all that spending is from separate funds,"" Joshua Sewell, a federal budget expert at the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense, told PolitiFact in October 2024.
During Trump’s first administration, he shifted $271 million in FEMA funding, including about $155 million from the Disaster Relief Fund, to address immigration.
New York City received about $59 million from FEMA, spent $19 million on hotels
Musk did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for evidence that FEMA sent New York City $59 million ""last week."" 
FEMA’s Shelter and Services Program website shows how much money state and local governments and nonprofit organizations have received from the program. However, the data is only updated through fiscal year 2024. In 2024, New York City’s Office of Management and Budget received $59 million.

The New York City’s mayor office told The Associated Press Feb. 10 that it received $81 million from the federal government the week of Feb. 3 in two payments — one for $59 million, $19 million of which went to direct hotel costs. The mayor’s office did not respond to our request for comment.
""This morning, my financial team shockingly uncovered that President Trump and his crony Elon Musk illegally executed a revocation of $80 million in congressionally-appropriated FEMA funding from New York City’s bank accounts late yesterday afternoon,"" Brad Lander, New York City’s comptroller said in a statement posted to the agency’s website. ""This is money that the federal government previously disbursed for shelter and services and is now missing. This highway robbery of our funds directly out of our bank account is a betrayal of everyone who calls New York City home."" 
New York City law requires the government to provide shelter to people who need it. According to a July 2024 comptroller report, the city spent an average of $156 dollars per night per hotel room. 
According to FEMA’s list of allowable expenses for the shelter program, hotel room costs ""should be reasonable based on the rate set by the U.S. General Services Administration.""
The U.S. General Services Administration sets the per diem rates for New York City hotel rooms at between $179 and $342 per night, depending on the month. Luxury, five-star hotels in New York City cost around $400 to $1,000 a night, according to a search on Expedia, a travel booking site.
Our ruling
Musk said ""The @DOGE team just discovered that FEMA sent $59M LAST WEEK to luxury hotels in New York City to house illegal migrants … That money is meant for American disaster relief.""
FEMA awarded New York City $59 million in fiscal year 2024. The money is part of a program that Congress approved to reimburse local and state governments and nonprofit organizations that provide basic services to immigrants. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection funds the program and FEMA manages it. None of the money comes from FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund, which is primarily used after natural disasters. 
New York City does not house migrants in luxury hotel rooms. In 2024, it spent an average of $156 dollars per night per hotel room, below the General Services Administration’s per diem rate. The city spent $19 million on hotel rooms.

Now, they are scrutinizing the wealth of the agency’s former leader.
In a Feb. 11 Oval Office press availability, Trump asked Musk, ""Can you mention some of the things that your team has found, some of the crazy numbers, including the woman that walked away with about $30 million?""
Musk replied, ""We do find it sort of rather odd that, you know, there are quite a few people in the bureaucracy who have ostensibly a salary of a few hundred thousand dollars but somehow managed to accrue tens of millions of dollars in net worth while they are in that position. Which is, you know, what happened to USAID, we're just curious as to where it came from.""

He also reshared a Feb. 9 post from Mario Nawfal, who hosts an X Spaces cryptocurrency show and has 2 million followers, that read, ""Ex-USAID chief Samantha Power’s net worth skyrockets — from $6.7M to $30M on a $180K salary.

""Sounds very fishy,"" Musk wrote.
Contrary to Nawfal’s claim, Power’s assets did not ""skyrocket""; she already held assets averaging a total of $20 million before she became head of USAID.
In his post, Nawfal cited ""vBulletin"" and ""Inside Biden’s Basement"" as sources. The latter website, which says it tracks Biden administration alumni, estimated Power’s net worth between $10.1 million and $30.3 million. PolitiFact found no public evidence of the claim from the community forum software program vBulletin, which hosts private forums.
Power ran USAID for nearly four years under President Joe Biden, from May 2021 to January 2025. During the Obama administration, she served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations from 2013 to 2017, and held a senior staff position at the National Security Council from 2009 to 2013. Power was a Harvard Kennedy School professor and has written multiple books, including ""The Education of an Idealist,"" ""A Problem from Hell"" and ""Chasing the Flame."" 
After Biden nominated Power to be USAID administrator in January 2021, she filed a financial disclosure report as required.
PolitiFact analyzed her financial disclosures from January 2021, May 2022, May 2023 and May 2024. These disclosures generally don’t include assets or government income. They permit officials to report their assets and liabilities in range values, not fixed amounts, so it’s difficult to know their exact net worth. 
We took the minimum and maximum amounts of Power’s assets, her spouse’s assets, and ""other assets and incomes"" she reported, and added them together. Then, we subtracted Power’s reported liabilities to get her net worth. 
In 2021, Power’s assets and income sources included compensation and benefits from her teaching position at Harvard University, capital gains from venture capital firm the Social+Capital Partnership LLC, multiple book royalties and honoraria from speaking engagements. In ""other assets and income,"" Power listed cash values in 12 U.S. banks, several Vanguard holdings, and other stocks.

That year, Power’s spouse, Cass Sunstein, a Harvard Law School professor and former administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, recorded double the assets of Power.
All the assets listed in Power’s financial disclosure totaled $11 million to $30 million. Power listed one item — a mortgage — under liabilities, valued from $500,001 to $1 million, which would have made her net worth between $10 million and $29.5 million. It was the only liability Powers reported for four years. 
Her total combined assets did not fluctuate wildly during her term. In 2022, her average net worth was $20.9 million; in 2023, $18.2 million; and in 2024, $20.8 million.
Her personal assets decreased while she was in the federal agency role. She received fewer honoraria in 2022, 2023 and 2024, her disclosures show.

In an interview with Fox News host Bret Baier that aired Feb. 10, Trump said the U.S. performs poorly on the global scale despite spending more than others on education.
""We're last in education out of 40 states,"" Trump said. ""We're last, we're number 40, but we're No. 1 in cost per pupil.""
Although Trump said ""states,"" it became clear as he spoke that he was referring to other nations — he described Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and China as being top in education globally. He did not, however, clarify all 40 countries he was referring to. A White House spokesperson pointed us to data on a U.S. educational assessment that provided no international comparison supporting Trump’s claim.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, a group of advanced, industrialized nations, measures international education outcomes.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
But the U.S. doesn’t rank last among the 38 OECD member states on any education metric, according to the organization’s data. The organization measures countries by student skills, educational attainment, years in education and economic equality.
""The US is rarely at the very bottom of an educational rankings that includes a broad range of countries (like the OECD),"" said Ofer Malamud, a Northwestern University economist researching international education. ""Although it isn’t usually near the top of these lists either.""
On cost per pupil, the U.S. spends much more than the international average, but it is not the highest spender of the OECD countries.
Trump’s criticism of the Education Department came as he and ally Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE — an agency Trump established by executive order — try to dismantle the agency and cancel large swaths of department spending. In the Fox News interview, Trump argued states would perform better in education if they received money directly rather than through Education Department programs. 
""While we spend billions of taxpayer dollars to fund our education system, less than half of 4th and 8th graders are performing at proficient levels in reading or math,"" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in an email, referring to National Center for Education Statistics’ state-by-state test scores known as the nation’s report card. 
Education performance
The OECD measures education outcomes based on the educational attainment, skills and years in education. OECD’s member countries include Sweden, France, Turkey, South Korea and Colombia. Its data included 37 to 41 countries, depending on when it was collected and which countries participated. 
The U.S. ranks eighth out of 41 countries in the portion of people with at least a secondary, or high school, education, with 92% of its people aged 25 to 65 holding a high school diploma. 
On the average number of years students spend in formal education, the U.S. ranks 23rd out of 41. From age 5, a child in the U.S. will spend an average of 17.3 years in formal education, according to the OECD. 
Mexico ranks last in educational attainment, while Colombia ranks last in years in education. The leaders in both metrics were Russia and Australia, respectively. 
The OECD administers the Program for International Student Assessment, or PISA, to member states and nonmember states. Looking at the 37 member states that reported scores in 2022, U.S. students scored above the international average in reading and science, but below average in math. 
The U.S. ranked 13th in science with a score that was 14 points above the OECD average. In reading, it ranked sixth, scoring 28 points above average. Math performance was lower: The U.S. ranked 28th, scoring seven points below OECD average. 
When compared with all 81 countries that took the test in 2022, including non-OECD countries, the U.S. ranked 16th in science, ninth in reading, and 34th in math.
PISA test scores also reveal, however, that when U.S. student performance is measured against itself, scores have dropped in the last several years. From 2018 to 2022, science scores fell by three points, reading by one point, and math by 13 points. Meanwhile, U.S. science and reading performance have risen modestly over the last 20 years while math has declined overall in line with global trends.
An OECD report pointed to COVID-19-related school closures and access to digital devices as contributing to weaker scores.

That puts the U.S. in third place, behind Luxembourg and Norway. The numbers are adjusted for purchasing power in the different countries.
The U.S.’ ranking is pulled higher by its high spending on college education, which includes dollars dedicated for research and development and is second after Luxembourg. Looking at primary school alone, the U.S. spends the sixth most of the 37 countries, with $15,270 per pupil. The OECD average was $11,902. 
Comparing education spending across countries is difficult, education experts said, because countries approach education funding differently.
""The US has long provided more services to students — such as meals, transportation, extracurriculars such as sports, and special education — than do other countries,"" Vanderbilt University public policy and education professor Sean Corcoran said. ""Many of these services do not translate directly into higher student achievement, but they are highly valued by families and society as a whole."" 
Because U.S. education is mostly funded by state and local governments, per-pupil spending can vary widely by school district, University of Washington education history professor Matthew Kelly said. 
Although there are some exceptions, high-income school districts tend to spend more money on education per pupil and have better outcomes, while low-income districts tend to spend less and have worse outcomes. 
Kelly said extensive research has demonstrated that higher education funding leads to better test scores, lower high school dropout rates and higher college enrollment rates.
Our ruling
Trump said the U.S. is ""last in education out of 40 states"" and ""No. 1 in cost per pupil.""
Both claims are wrong. The U.S. does not lead any international rankings for education, but it is not at the bottom of the list, either. Cost per pupil is higher than most developed countries, but not the highest.

On her eponymous podcast’s Feb. 3 episode, former Fox News host Megyn Kelly asked Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., whether he would root for the Kansas City Chiefs to defeat the Philadelphia Eagles during the Feb. 9 championship game. 
""So, does this mean, since you used to coach Patrick Mahomes, that you’re rooting for the Chiefs at the big game this Sunday?"" Kelly asked. Tuberville spent 40 years as a college football coach — including at Mahomes’ alma mater Texas Tech University — before becoming a U.S. senator. 
With a smile, Tuberville gently corrected Kelly. 
""Well, I never even coached him,"" he said. ""What happened is — I recruited him. And then I left and went to another school. But I’ve got to be very good friends with him. He’s a good — not just a good athlete. He’s a very good example for a lot of our young youth across this country.""

We contacted Tuberville’s office and received no reply.
Tuberville was Texas Tech’s head football coach from 2010 to 2012, three full seasons. He resigned as head coach Dec. 8, 2012. 
Mahomes played for Texas Tech from 2014 to 2016, before the NFL’s Kansas City Chiefs drafted him in 2017.

""We'll have the capacity to continue to do there what we've always done. We've always had a presence of illegal immigrants there that have been detained. We're just building out some capacity,"" Homeland Security Kristi Noem said Feb. 2 on NBC’s ""Meet the Press.""
Noem made a similar claim Feb. 9 on CNN’s ""State of the Union,"" two days after visiting the Guantánamo Bay facility.
The U.S. has previously used a Guantánamo Bay camp to detain certain migrants, but Trump’s use is different, immigration experts said.
On Jan. 29, Trump signed a memo directing the departments of Defense and Homeland Security to expand the Migrant Operations Center at Guantánamo Bay to ""provide additional detention space for high-priority criminal aliens unlawfully present in the United States.""
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
The administration has provided conflicting information about where migrants will be held within Guantánamo Bay, for how long and under what conditions. 
Based on available information, there are key differences between the naval center’s previous immigration operations and the Trump administration’s approach:
Historically, the U.S. has used Guantánamo Bay to hold migrants stopped at sea. Now, Trump is sending people who were detained on U.S. soil.
Previously, migrants were held at the Migrant Operations Center, a different part of the base from the prisons where terrorism suspects are detained. The first group of migrants that arrived at Guantánamo Bay under Trump are detained in the prisons where terrorism suspects were held.
In recent years, the Migrant Operations Center has held few migrants and had limited capacity. Trump says he plans to detain 30,000 people. That many people haven’t been detained at Guantánamo Bay since the 1990s.
Haitian refugees are lined up in cots Dec. 5, 1991, in the McCalla hangar in Guantánamo Bay Naval Base. (AP)
In the 1990s, the U.S. held thousands of Haitians and Cubans at Guantánamo Bay
The Guantánamo Bay naval base is better known as a high-security prison for foreign terrorism suspects following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. But about a decade before, the U.S. used a section of it as a migrant detention center.
In the early 1990s, the U.S. Coast Guard held Haitians and Cubans intercepted at sea at Guantánamo Bay. In September 1994, 12,000 Haitians and 33,000 Cubans were held in Guantánamo Bay’s Migrant Operations Center, the Congressional Research Service found. People were held in tentlike structures surrounded by razor wire.
People held in Guantánamo Bay did not have access to lawyers to help them apply for asylum, Yale Law professor Harold Koh told PBS News in 2017. Koh sued the U.S. government over its treatment of Haitians in Guantánamo Bay. 
Some Haitians and Cubans were allowed to apply for asylum; few got it. Many Haitians whom the government determined could apply for asylum were barred from entering the U.S. to apply because they were HIV-positive, the National Immigrant Justice Center, an immigrant advocacy organization, wrote in a 2021 report. 
The migrant camp closed in 1996. But that wasn’t the last time migrants were held in Guantánamo Bay.

In recent years, some Cubans and Haitians have been held in Guantánamo Bay
The Guantánamo Migrant Operations Center, which is separate from the detention center where terrorism suspects are kept, can hold about 130 people, according to the Global Detention Project, an international group that documents immigration detention worldwide.
The Department of Homeland Security did not answer PolitiFact’s query about how many migrants were at Guantánamo Bay before Trump’s order. But in September 2024, The New York Times reported the center had held 37 people from 2020 to 2023, and four people as of February 2024. People detained there were intercepted at sea by the U.S. Coast Guard.
People intercepted at sea and sent to Guantánamo don’t have the option to seek asylum in the U.S., the International Refugee Assistance Project said in a September 2024 report. Instead they must choose between returning to the country they’re fleeing or waiting in Guantánamo Bay for a third country to accept them.
Migrants at Guantánamo Bay lack ""access to basic human necessities, appropriate medical care, education, and potable water,"" the refugee project said in its report. Migrants don’t have access to unmonitored calls with attorneys and can’t candidly speak about poor conditions at the naval base, the report said. 
How long people have been held in Guantánamo Bay varies. The New York Times reported in 2024 that families have been there for more than six months. But in one case, someone was held for nearly four years.
How the Trump administration’s approach for migrant detention at Guantánamo Bay is different
Trump’s unprecedented proposal raises legal questions. 
The U.S. has never sent people who were arrested or detained in the United States to Guantánamo, the Council on Foreign Relations, a nonpartisan foreign policy think tank, wrote Feb. 4.
Under federal law, people in the U.S. accused of civil immigration violations have more rights than the people intercepted at sea, Hannah Flamm, interim senior policy director at the International Refugee Assistance Project, said.
People who have been on U.S. soil ""have rights and protections, even if they are sent to Guantánamo. Whether these rights will be respected is another question,"" she said.
It’s not clear how due process for migrants will be followed, as Noem assured.
""The U.S. government intentionally uses Guantánamo in hopes of avoiding oversight and the public eye, which makes the facility ripe for abuse,"" Flamm said.
The American Civil Liberties Union wrote the Trump administration a letter Feb. 7 requesting access to the migrants who have been sent to Guantánamo Bay so they have ""access to legal counsel, and so advocates and the public can understand the conditions under which the government is detaining them.""

Video shows “roads heading to Mexico are jam packed as mass deportations have started.”
By Loreben Tuquero • January 24, 2025
In her Feb. 9 CNN interview, Noem said she and Trump were ""comfortable"" that it is legal to bring migrants who were already on U.S. soil to the island.
It’s unclear how long the migrants will be at Guantánamo Bay under Trump’s plan.
Noem and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have said immigrants’ detention at Guantánamo Bay will be temporary while they await deportation. On CNN, Noem said, ""My goal is that people are not in these facilities for weeks and months,"" though she wouldn’t rule out longer stays if other countries don’t accept them.
On Jan. 29, Trump said he intends Guantánamo Bay to hold ""the worst criminal illegal aliens threatening the American people. Some of them are so bad we don’t even trust their countries to hold them because we don’t want them coming back.""
It’s unclear what will happen if the government tries to indefinitely detain migrants sent to Guantánamo Bay. 
People cannot be indefinitely held in immigration detention in the U.S., the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2001. So immigrants who cannot be deported because their home countries won’t accept deportation flights are generally released. 
Another shift from the previous use of Guantánamo Bay for immigration detention is the location where migrants will be held under Trump’s administration.
Hegseth said migrants sent to Guantánamo Bay would be detained separately from the camp where terrorism suspects are kept. He said they would be detained in the Migrant Operations Center.
The 10 migrants on the first flight from the U.S. to Guantánamo Bay were placed in one of the detention centers where terrorism suspects previously held, not in the Migrant Operations Center. The building the migrants are in is not the same building where the remaining 15 wartime detainees are held, the Defense Department said.
Wartime detainees have been held in Guantánamo Bay for decades. 
In this Feb. 6, 2016 photo, a detainee cell in Camp 6 is seen inside the U.S. detention center at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. (AP)
Our ruling
Noem said that at Guantánamo Bay, ""we'll have the capacity to continue to do there what we've always done. We've always had a presence of illegal immigrants there that have been detained."" 
The Trump administration has provided limited and conflicting information about its plans to detain migrants in Guantánamo Bay. Noem’s characterization that the administration is continuing what the U.S. has previously done leaves out key details.
In the 1990s, the U.S. used Guantánamo Bay to hold Haitian and Cuban immigrants intercepted at sea. The Trump administration is now sending to Guantánamo people who were arrested on U.S. soil. That hasn’t happened before.
In the 1990s, more than 30,000 people were held in tentlike structures. In recent years, fewer than a hundred people have been held at the migrant center at a time. 
Trump is planning to significantly increase Guantánamo Bay’s immigration detention capacity to 30,000.  
The first group of migrants to arrive in Guantánamo Bay under Trump’s proposal are being held in the detention center that has historically held terrorism suspects. That’s not the same place where migrants have historically been held.

About three weeks after the Oct. 7, 2024, interview aired, Trump sued CBS Broadcasting Inc. and CBS Interactive Inc. for $10 billion, claiming the news outlet deceptively edited the ""60 Minutes"" interview to favor Harris. Then, at the end of January, the Federal Communications Commission, led by Trump appointee Brendan Carr, called on CBS to release the unedited transcript and video. CBS News complied, releasing the content publicly Feb. 5.
In response, Trump posted Feb. 6 on his social media platform Truth Social that CBS committed ""fraud.""
""CBS and 60 Minutes defrauded the public by doing something which has never, to this extent, been seen before,"" Trump wrote. ""They 100% removed Kamala’s horrible election changing answers to questions, and replaced them with completely different, and far better, answers, taken from another part of the interview.""
Trump’s statement misrepresents what happened.

Trump is referring to Harris’ answers in two videos CBS News released. In an Oct. 6, 2024, video clip previewing the interview on the CBS News show ""Face the Nation,"" Harris answered a question about U.S.-Israel relations. The next day, when the ""60 Minutes"" interview aired, it showed Harris giving a different answer to the same question.
The full, unedited interview transcript shows that CBS News’ ""60 Minutes"" took Harris’ answers in both videos from the same three-and-a-half-minute exchange on U.S.-Israel relations. It does not show that CBS News replaced Harris’ answers on this topic with a response from a different portion of the interview.
It’s typical for news outlets to edit long interviews into shorter broadcast segments or published stories.
Trump backed out of his CBS News ""60 Minutes"" interview before the 2024 election, breaking a decadeslong tradition of major party presidential candidates’ interviews with the network ahead of the general election.
PolitiFact contacted the White House for comment, but received no response.
What the full, unedited transcript shows
Because the interview aired on the anniversary of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, ""60 Minutes"" correspondent Bill Whitaker began the interview with questions about Israel and the Biden-Harris administration’s relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
PolitiFact annotated the unedited interview transcript below to show how ""60 Minutes"" presented Harris’ answers in the preview clip and aired interview.
Here’s a guide, followed by the exchange:
Bold: Only in the preview clip.
Italics: Only in the aired interview.
Bold and italics: In both videos.
Unmarked sections: Not included in either video.
Whitaker: ""We supply Israel with billions of dollars in military aid.""
Harris: ""Mm-hmm.""
Whitaker: ""And yet Prime Minister Netanyahu seems to be charting his own course. The Biden administration, the Biden-Harris administration has pressed him to agree to a cease-fire, he's resisted. You urged him not to go into Lebanon, he went in anyway. He has promised to make Iran pay for the missile attack, and that has the potential of expanding the war. Does the U.S. have no sway over Prime Minister Netanyahu?""
Harris: ""Well, let’s start with this. On this subject, the aid that we have given Israel allowed Israel to defend itself against 200 ballistic missiles that were just meant to attack the Israelis, and the people of Israel. And I think that is the most recent example of why what we do to assist in their defense around military aid is important. And when we think about the threat that Hamas, Hezbollah presents Iran, I think that it is without any question our imperative to do what we can to allow Israel to defend itself against those kinds of attacks. Now, the work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles, which include the need for humanitarian aid, the need for this war to end, the need for a deal to be done which would release the hostages, and create a cease-fire. And we’re not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel, and in the region, including with other leaders in the region, including Arab leaders.""
Whitaker: ""But it seems that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening. The Wall Street Journal said that he — that your administration has repeatedly been blindsided by Netanyahu, and in fact, he has rebuffed just about all of your administration’s entreaties.""
Harris: ""Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region. And we’re not going to stop doing that. We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.""
Whitaker: ""Just one last thing. Do we have a real close ally in Prime Minister Netanyahu?""
Harris: ""I think, with all due respect, the better question is do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people. And the answer to that question is, ‘Yes.’ And we are going to do what is important to support whatever leadership is in Israel, that is defending the security of the State of Israel.""

After this response, Whitaker changed topics to ask Harris why she wanted to be president. The Israel topic arose only once more during the interview, when Harris briefly mentioned Iran’s ballistic missile attack on Israel.
The full, unedited interview video is available on ""60 Minutes"" YouTube page. The exchange about U.S.-Israel relations starts about six minutes in.
You can also read the full, unedited interview transcript here. The exchange about U.S.-Israel relations is on Pages 11-13. Parts highlighted in yellow were included in the preview clip, parts highlighted in blue were in the aired interview and parts highlighted in green were in both videos.
Why did ""60 Minutes"" share different clips?
When publishing the transcripts and video the Federal Communications Commission requested, CBS News said in a statement that the content shows ""the ‘60 Minutes’ broadcast was not doctored or deceitful.""
In its statement, CBS News noted that it’s common practice for journalists to edit interviews for time, space or clarity. The full, unedited interview video is 57 minutes long; that was edited down to 20 minutes.
CBS News said it broadcast a longer portion of Harris’ answer to Whitaker’s question about U.S.-Israel relations in a preview clip and a shorter version of Harris’ answer was included in the aired interview.
The news outlet said it edited the ""60 Minutes"" interview to include as much of Harris’ answers to Whitaker’s questions as possible, while fairly representing the substance of Harris’ answers.
CBS News made a similar statement Oct. 20, 2024, rebutting Trump’s accusation of deceitful editing.
Kelly McBride, senior vice president and chair of Craig Newmark Center for Ethics and Leadership at the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, told PolitiFact that CBS News’ ""60 Minutes"" edited the Harris interview reasonably. (The Poynter Institute owns PolitiFact.)
""I would say that their edits are completely within the standards that journalists employ when they try to create an informative product for the public,"" McBride said. ""It seems very much like what journalists do with all verbose speakers, including and especially Donald Trump.""
Our ruling
Trump posted on Truth Social that CBS News and 60 Minutes ""replaced"" Harris’ ""60 Minutes"" interview answers ""with completely different, and far better, answers, taken from another part of the interview.""
The full, unedited interview transcript does not show that CBS News’ ""60 Minutes"" replaced all of Harris’ answers to questions about U.S.-Israel relations with a response from a different part of the interview. CBS did not change Harris’ meaning.
News outlets commonly edit interviews for length and clarity. CBS News used a longer version of Harris’ response in a video clip previewing the ""60 Minutes"" interview on the CBS News show ""Face the Nation."" It used a shorter excerpt of Harris’ answer in the aired ""60 Minutes"" interview. Both parts of Harris’ answer were taken from the same segment of the interview, the unedited transcript shows.
A media ethics expert said the ""60 Minutes"" interview adhered to typical journalistic standards.
We rate this claim False.

The S-76B is a luxury helicopter used to ferry celebrities and other high profile figures. It can be customized to seat five to eight passengers along with crew members, according to its makers.
A small number of this helicopter model is used by air ambulances and during search and rescue, but its primary clientele are VIPs.

"Marco Rubio
stated on February 3, 2025 in in a letter to Congress:",On support for U.S. Agency for International Development,"stated on February 3, 2025 in in a letter to Congress:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/feb/07/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-supported-usaid-as-a-senator-as-secret/,,"Secretary of State Marco Rubio was once a longtime supporter of the recently gutted U.S. Agency for International Development. You wouldn’t know that from his early days as USAID’s acting director under President Donald Trump.
The agency that then-Sen. Rubio hailed for its ""critical"" and ""important"" programs? Rubio now says it suffers from disorganization and ""rank insubordination"" that hinders Trump’s foreign policy.
Trump and Department of Government Efficiency leader Elon Musk are pushing for major upheaval at USAID, including the reported shedding of all but 300 of its roughly 10,000 employees, or roughly 97% of its workforce. Rubio has helped carry out Trump’s agenda, although those reductions are being challenged in court. 
""U.S. AID systems and processes are not well synthesized, integrated, or coordinated, and often result in discord in the foreign policy and foreign relations of the United States,"" Rubio wrote in a Feb. 3 letter to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. ""This undermines the president’s ability to carry out foreign relations."" 
In a Feb. 5 Fox News interview, Rubio said USAID may be consolidated directly into the State Department. ""The goal was to reform it, but now we have rank insubordination,"" he said.

On occasion, PolitiFact uses its Flip-O-Meter to measure a politician’s consistency on particular issues. The rating does not make a value judgment about a politician who changes positions, but rather documents changes over time.
Rubio’s recent remarks about the agency show a marked departure from his prior stance as a defender of at least some USAID programs as vital for improving American national security and world health.
The State Department did not respond to an inquiry from PolitiFact.
Rubio regularly touted USAID’s work as a senator
During his 14 years as a Republican senator from Florida, Rubio repeatedly praised USAID for its work across a broad range of issues, from ensuring free and fair elections in Burma to supporting humanitarian efforts in Venezuela to providing hurricane relief in the Bahamas. 
At the same time, he also called for increased transparency within the agency, saying USAID’s funds must be spent effectively. 
""In every region of the world, we should always search for ways to use U.S. aid and humanitarian assistance to strengthen our influence, the effectiveness of our leadership, and the service of our interests and ideals,"" Rubio said during a 2012 speech at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C., think tank. ""Foreign aid is a very cost-effective way, not only to export our values and our example, but to advance our security and our economic interests.""
In 2013 and 2015, Rubio sponsored bills to create clear goals, define performance metrics and establish plans for monitoring and evaluating U.S. foreign assistance programs. A version of this bill, not sponsored by Rubio, passed the Senate in 2016 and became law.
From 2016 to 2023, under presidents of both parties, Rubio praised the agency on social media for providing hurricane relief in multiple Latin American countries; combating polio, Ebola, and tuberculosis (aid he called ""critical""); providing humanitarian assistance to Venezuelan refugees after the reelection of President Nicolás Maduro (aid he called ""important""); and providing Ukraine with humanitarian aid at the Russia-Ukraine war’s outset.
Rubio co-sponsored a 2018 bill with Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., that allocated USAID funding for violence prevention in certain countries and granted money to support USAID’s Global Initiative to Reduce Fragility and Violence.
He co-sponsored other bills that propose work for USAID, including a 2021 bill to advance global women’s rights, a 2022 bill to protect victims of international human trafficking, a 2017 bill authorizing $50 million for USAID involvement to combat substance abuse in the Philippines, and a 2021 bill for expanding access to education. He also wrote a 2021 letter to President Joe Biden urging USAID humanitarian relief in Colombia.
In a 2018 letter to then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Rubio, Kaine, and then-Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., wrote, ""We believe it is critical that USAID continue to play an active role in providing technical assistance, education and training to support countries’ efforts to strengthen electoral systems. USAID’s democracy and governance programs are vital for capacity building.""
Assessing USAID’s financial cost, political influence
In the past, Rubio has framed USAID as a relatively inexpensive investment in the nation’s security.
Many Americans overestimate how much the government spends on foreign aid, and Rubio repeatedly emphasized how small a portion of the federal budget foreign aid comprises. All foreign aid accounts for $68 billion, or about 1% of the total spent by the government in recent years; USAID itself is responsible for $43.4 billion of that $68 billion, or about 0.7% of all spending.
""Foreign aid as a part of our overall budget is less than 1% of the total amount the U.S. government spends,"" Rubio said in a 2017 Senate speech. ""I think it is important for those of us who believe in global engagement and believe in the function of foreign aid to justify it, to never take it for granted, and to constantly examine it to make sure the money is being spent well and that it is worth spending at all.""

“DOGE and OMB also found that there was about to be $50 million taxpayer dollars that went out the door to fund condoms in Gaza.”
By Caleb McCullough • January 30, 2025
In 2019, Rubio argued against cutting foreign aid as a way to meaningfully lower the federal debt.
""Anybody who tells you that we can slash foreign aid and that will bring us to balance is lying to you,"" he said in the speech to the Forum Club of the Palm Beaches. 
Rubio saw aid as a foreign policy tool to deter Chinese influence. 
In a 2022 letter to Biden, Rubio said USAID must receive funding ""to send a clear message that the United States has a comprehensive strategy to counter the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) expanding global influence and the increasing threat it poses to U.S. security interests and those of our allies and partners.""
In the Feb. 3 Fox News interview, Rubio said USAID funding had little to do with combating the Chinese Communist Party’s influence — and that aid from the Chinese government would not fill the foreign aid vacuum. 
In his new role, Rubio acknowledged some of his past commentary. According to a partial transcript obtained by The New York Times, Rubio said at a private embassy event that ""foreign aid is the least popular thing government spends money on. And I spent a lot of time in my career defending it and explaining it. But it’s harder and harder to do across the board. It really is.""
Rubio said foreign policy leaders understand foreign aid ""is essential,"" but ""it has to be programs that we can defend. It has to be programs that we can explain. It has to be programs that we can justify. Otherwise, we do endanger foreign aid.""
This may sound as if Rubio favors a cautious, deliberate effort to discern which programs should be continued and which ones should be ended. But that clashes with his recent actions, which have precipitated a cut of 97% of the agency’s staff.
Our ruling
On at least two dozen occasions over more than a decade — including in speeches, social media posts, and bill introductions — Rubio praised USAID’s work, from hurricane relief to battling infectious diseases to aiding refugees. He spoke broadly of the agency’s importance for American interests and countering China.
That yearslong record of praise contrasts sharply with his 2025 letter to Congress that said the agency’s failure ""undermines the president’s ability to carry out foreign relations,"" and the sudden, nearly across-the-board cuts he is executing.
Rubio’s change of message — from repeatedly praising USAID’s value to the U.S. and the world from 2012 to 2023, to saying it’s a danger to U.S. foreign policy in 2025 and abolishing most of its employees and work — rates as a Full Flop.

"Randy Fine
stated on January 28, 2025 in a senate special session:",Florida’s in-state college tuition waiver for immigrants in the country illegally costs the state $41 million.,"stated on January 28, 2025 in a senate special session:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/feb/06/randy-fine/florida-sen-randy-fines-shaky-claim-that-immigrant/,,"As Florida Republicans continue to fight about whose plan is best to help President Donald Trump on immigration, one group hangs in the balance: immigrants in the country illegally who attend Florida public colleges. 
If signed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis — who has threatened to veto it — the Legislature’s immigration bill would revoke a 2014 law that lets immigrants in the country illegally who meet certain conditions pay in-state college tuition rates, which are typically much lower than out-of-state rates. The Legislature could override a DeSantis veto.
One supporter of eliminating the law, state Sen. Randy Fine, R-Brevard, said during a Jan. 28 special session the waiver encourages illegal immigration.

While listing reasons for eliminating the law, Fine, who cosponsored the immigration bill, said: ""Number one: it costs money. … We estimate $41 million dollars.""

During the special session, state Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando, pressed Fine on that point, saying, ""You’ve mentioned several times that we’re going to be saving $41 million. … So, you’re saying once we repeal in-state tuition we are going to get that $41 million back into the general revenue so we can reappropriate that, right? We are going to be saving as a state.""
Fine said, ""The universities would get to keep the $41 million. All tuition in the state goes directly to the universities.""
PolitiFact contacted Fine’s office to ask about the $41 million figure’s source. His office sent us the Senate analysis of the immigration bill, which estimated that for the 2023-24 fiscal year the value of the waived out-of-state fees totaled about $40.6 million.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
But that is not the same as the state paying that amount for the program.

The Senate analysis also says the fiscal impact of repealing the provision cannot be determined because it would be hard to identify exactly how many students would be affected. The waivers don’t identify the students by immigration status, but the in-state tuition waiver for immigrants in the country illegally has steep requirements to qualify, so experts believe only that group would apply for it.
""The revenue impact will also depend on the behavior of affected students,"" and whether they choose to reenroll without waivers, the analysis concludes. ""While the cumulative amount of the fee waivers was more than $40 million in (fiscal year) 2023-2024, it is not clear that institutions will receive that revenue with the changes to the fee waiver.""
Florida’s in-state college tuition waiver
In 2014, then-Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, signed House Bill 851, allowing immigrants in the country illegally to pay in-state college tuition rates if they meet certain requirements. ""Students that grew up in our state are going to get the same in-state tuition as their peers, which is what's fair,"" Scott said.
Florida, which is among 25 states with similar ""tuition-equity"" laws, offers a number of student waivers. The one given to immigrants in the country illegally is the 5012 nonresident waiver.

To qualify, students must prove that they graduated from a Florida high school, spent at least three consecutive years in Florida schools immediately before graduating and applied to a higher education institution within 24 months of high school graduation. (Immigrants in the country illegally remain ineligible for Florida scholarships such as Bright Futures and federal financial aid.)

The waiver’s requirements are stricter than those for legal residents and U.S. citizens, who must show they’ve lived in the state for at least 12 months before the academic term.

In-state tuition costs around $3,000 for Florida’s community colleges and $6,000 for public universities. Out-of-state tuition rates can cost more than three times as much. 
Will eliminating the waiver save the state money?
The Florida Policy Institute, a center-left research organization, said in a Jan. 15 report that ""contrary to how some state lawmakers have recently framed the fiscal impact of these waivers,"" allowing immigrants in the country illegally to access in-state tuition ""has not cost the state money."" Instead, the institute estimated that the waiver has ""generated millions in revenue for institutions experiencing drops in enrollment and financial strain.""

Take the Florida College System, previously known as community colleges. About 4,500 students used the in-state tuition waiver at those schools during the 2023-24 academic year, bringing in about $14.7 million in tuition, according to Florida Policy Institute’s calculation.
Enrollment at the 28-member college system remains 11% below prepandemic levels and education experts say it’s unlikely that enough new students would enroll to replace immigrants in the country illegally.

""There are no students ‘waiting in the wings’ to replace tuition paid by these students and the potential for colleges to lose out on this revenue is high,"" the Florida Policy Institute said in its report.

Second lady Usha Vance “will have her citizenship revoked if (President Donald) Trump signs his executive order banning birthright citizenship.”
By Sara Swann • January 21, 2025
The Florida Policy Institute and Senate analysis arrived at their waiver value estimates in different ways. The Senate’s analysis appears to reflect the difference between out-of-state and in-state tuition for students who received the waivers.

The Florida Policy Institute estimated how much students receiving waivers paid in tuition by multiplying the number of students who received the waiver in the 2023-24 academic year by the average cost of in-state tuition. The organization estimated that about 6,500 immigrants in the country illegally used the waiver to attend Florida’s colleges and state universities, paying about $26.7 million in in-state tuition and fees.

""It is misleading to say the waivers ‘cost’ $40.6 million because in reality, if students are not offered this waiver, many will not attend school in Florida at all,"" said Alexis Tsoukalas, a senior policy analyst at Florida Policy Institute and author of the brief. 
Florida colleges and universities are supported by Florida residents’ taxes, so ""state residents can attend public institutions at a lower cost than those not residents of the state,"" according to the Florida Department of Education. In Florida, immigrants in the country illegally paid about $1.8 billion in state and local taxes in 2022.
Our ruling
Fine said Florida’s in-state college tuition waiver for immigrants in the country illegally costs the state $41 million.

One analysis shows that the value of the waivers was more than $40 million in fiscal year 2023-24. That doesn’t mean the state paid that amount for the program. The program does not technically cost the state money.
Fine’s statement has an element of truth in that if the waiver is eliminated, public colleges and universities could receive more money in tuition payments from immigrants in the country illegally if they still chose to enroll, or other students wanting to enroll in the institutions. 
But education policy experts estimate that revoking the provision would likely cause colleges and universities to lose revenue. There likely aren’t enough students to enroll to make up for the loss of immigrants in the country illegally, who might not be able to afford tuition without the waiver. Many of Florida’s colleges already have enrollment numbers below pre-pandemic levels.

The posts are wrong on two counts:
The flag icon atop many government websites is not new or unique to the second Trump administration. It was first used in 2017 during Trump’s first term and was used throughout former President Joe Biden’s administration. 
Civil War historians told PolitiFact that the flag used bears no resemblance to a confederate flag.
(Screenshots from X and Instagram.)
About the flag icon
A U.S. General Services Association spokesperson told PolitiFact in an email that the banner atop government websites is part of the U.S. Web Design System’s tool kit. The system helps government teams design and maintain their websites.
The tool kit recommends using the banner with the flag icon to identify official .gov or .mil domains to show the sites have secure HTTPS connections and to identify them as official government sites, the spokesperson said.
The banner hasn’t changed since its first publication in 2017. The number of stars was a design decision based on the flag icon’s limited size, and represents no past or current flags, the spokesperson said.
A State Department spokesperson said the General Services Administration maintains the federal website standards site, which said all government sites should use the federal government banner.
The State Department added the banner Nov. 30, 2020, based on that guidance, and it has remained on the site since, the spokesperson said.
A search of the Internet Archive shows several government websites using the nine-star flag icon before the start of Trump’s second term.
(Screenshot from a State Department website archived March 17, 2021, by the Internet Archive.)
Confederacy claims
Civil war historians told PolitiFact that the flag used on the website is not a Confederate flag.
The Confederacy’s first national flag, known as the ""Stars and Bars,"" was used from 1861 to 1863. Some versions of the flag had nine stars, they said.
""It started out with seven stars, one for each of the original states that seceded and formed the Confederacy,"" Paul Quigley, director of Virginia Tech University’s Virginia Center for Civil War Studies, said. ""As more states seceded and joined the Confederacy, more stars were added to the flag."" 
Those stars were arranged in a circle, not horizontally as seen atop the government websites. The Confederate flag also had one white and two red bars, far fewer bars than the government flag icon.
Because the flag’s similarity to the traditional Stars and Stripes caused confusion on the battlefield, the Confederacy in 1863 switched to the Second National Flag, known as the ""Stainless Banner,"" Quigley said. That flag arranged 13 stars in a St. Andrews Cross.
Scot Guenter, director of the Flag Research Center, a Houston-based group, said the flag icon on U.S. government sites is not an actual flag used by the government or the Confederacy, and was simply a design choice.

""Unfortunately, ramifications of using a variant of the true national flag that is just made up by an artist for looks didn’t even occur to whoever did this,"" Guenter said.
Kevin Levin, an author and historian, told PolitiFact he noticed many Bluesky social media users, including prominent people he respects, sharing the Confederate flag claim. He wrote two articles on Substack, an online platform for writers and journalists, debunking the claim.
Levin wrote that many people defending the claim pointed to a photo of a flag for sale on a website called Historical Americana Co. That flag had nine stars arranged horizontally and nine stripes. The site described it as a ""post Civil War re-union UCV Flag.""
UCV stands for United Confederate Veterans, a group that was formed in 1889 and dissolved in 1952. Levin wrote that the veterans group did not create its own flag, and no promotional material from the group shows the flag offered for sale.
Levin told PolitiFact that he’s never seen that flag before, nor have any experts he’s asked in recent days. Quigley also said he had not seen that flag before.
""I can say with confidence that it's not a Confederate veterans flag at all,"" Levin said.
Shae Smith Cox, a Texas A&M University assistant history professor who researches the Civil War, said that the flag for sale appears to be homemade and created for a United Confederate Veterans reunion, possibly during the ""memory phase"" of the Confederacy, when she said Union and Confederacy groups competed over how the Civil War would be remembered.
""There were no regulations on what people could create for that phase,"" Smith Cox said. 
The flag’s seller estimated the flag is from 1900 to 1920, which would be in that era, Smith Cox said, adding that 1913 marked the Battle of Gettysburg’s 50th anniversary.

The flag icon has been used on government sites since 2017, said a spokesperson for the General Services Association, which guides federal website standards. The flag had only nine stars because of space, and it has no relation to any current or past U.S. flag, the spokesperson said.
Civil War experts told PolitiFact the nine-star flag bears no resemblance to Confederate flags. The first Confederate national flag had a varying number of stars corresponding with the number of states that had seceded from the union. Some versions had nine stars, but they were arranged in a circle, not horizontally like the government website flag.

"Brian Mast
stated on February 2, 2025 in an interview on CBS' ""Face the Nation"":","From the U.S. Agency for International Development funding, “10 to 30 cents on the dollar is what actually goes to aid.”","stated on February 2, 2025 in an interview on CBS' ""Face the Nation"":",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/feb/05/brian-mast/why-the-republican-claim-about-the-majority-of-usa/,,"As the Trump administration moved to pause foreign aid, Republicans repeated a misleading claim that as little as 10% of foreign aid from a key agency goes to help people in need.
President Donald Trump told reporters Feb. 2 that the U.S. Agency for International Development, aka USAID, is ""run by a bunch of radical lunatics, and we're getting them out."" Billionaire business owner Elon Musk, who oversees a government cost-cutting commission, is leading an effort to shut down the agency.
USAID, the U.S. government’s international humanitarian and development arm, leads U.S. efforts in many countries to provide food and medicine and supports developing countries’ economic growth. 
U.S. Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., appearing Feb. 2 on CBS’ ""Face the Nation,"" said when it comes to USAID funding, ""10 to 30 cents on the dollar is what actually goes to aid. So there's not the right amount of command and control that's going on with the way that it's set up currently."" 
Mast’s interview comments left viewers with the impression that most of the funding doesn’t go to people in need.

""I mean, you could, you could almost say — this is a little bit hyperbole — but there's probably more dollars that go towards state dinners around the (Washington) D.C. Beltway than what actually goes into rice and beans abroad,"" Mast said. But he said during the Trump administration, ""It's going to be 99.99% of cents on the dollar actually go towards what it's intended, instead of people around the Beltway.""
The 10 to 30 cents number Mast cited is what USAID said it gives to local organizations in foreign countries. But Mast mischaracterizes what happens with the rest of the money. 
A January USAID report recapping 2024 said that about 12.1% of all USAID funding goes directly to local organizations in foreign countries, including nongovernmental, private sector and government partners. The rest of the funding is distributed through international organizations and companies, some of which are based in the U.S., that spend it on food, medicine and other assistance in developing countries or pass it to organizations based in those countries, said George Ingram, senior fellow in the Center for Sustainable Development at the Brookings Institution, a think tank. 
Former U.S. Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-N.J., who served as assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor in the Obama administration, disputed Mast’s statement.
""Mast is referring to the ‘localization’ percentage — the share of USAID funds that reach the needy through small local organizations,"" versus through large global humanitarian organizations, Malinowski wrote Feb. 3 on X.
Mast’s office did not respond to our emailed request for his evidence. 
What will happen with USAID?
USAID’s future remained uncertain Feb. 5. A message on the agency’s website said that all agency personnel will be placed on leave Feb. 7 with some exceptions. We contacted the agency Feb. 3 for comment but received no reply.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters Feb. 3 that he is the agency’s acting administrator but had delegated the authority to someone else. Also Feb. 3, Rubio on Fox News accused USAID of ""rank insubordination,"" adding, ""We had no choice but to bring this thing under control."" He seemed open to reforming USAID rather than abolishing it.
""American foreign assistance programs are not charity; they are strategic investments that directly advance U.S. security, economic interests, and global influence,"" said Elisha Dunn-Georgiou, president and CEO of the Global Health Council, an agency that works with more than 130 organizations across 150 countries. 
How USAID funding is distributed
Experts on USAID said Mast likely was referring to the January report about the agency’s efforts to direct more funding to local partners. 
The report says in 2024, ""USAID provided $2.1 billion directly to local non-governmental, private sector and government partners, or 12.1 percent of USAID’s acquisitions and assistance (A&A) and government-to-government (G2G) funding.""  
That number falls within Mast’s cited range of 10 to 30 cents on the dollar. But that ""doesn’t mean that’s all that goes to the country,"" said Jen Kates, an expert on global health at KFF, a U.S. health policy organization.
Here’s how federal foreign aid is distributed: Congress appropriates funding, often for a specific program such as HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, nutrition or maternal health. But Congress often doesn’t dictate which organizations receive the money. 
The money then flows to U.S. agencies including USAID, which distributes aid mostly through what it calls ""implementing partners,"" such as private contractors, nonprofit organizations, foreign governments, international organizations and other U.S. government agencies, according to the Congressional Research Service. 
Those partners are often based in the U.S. In 2024 more than $1 billion of USAID funding went to American small businesses.

“FEMA sent $59M LAST WEEK to luxury hotels in New York City to house illegal migrants… That money is meant for American disaster relief.”
By Maria Ramirez Uribe • February 14, 2025
A single organization can receive USAID money to provide tuberculosis prevention treatment, malaria medicines or antibiotics in several foreign countries. These nonlocal organizations are not counted in that 12% figure.
The process is not new; foreign aid has been distributed this way during Democratic and Republican administrations, including Trump’s first term. 
USAID set a goal in 2021 to increase the share of aid that goes to local partners, and that had bipartisan support. 
How the claim spread 
Before Mast commented about USAID, other similar claims cited a Jan. 7 PBS interview that briefly quoted Walter Kerr, co-executive director of the nonprofit organization Unlock Aid. Kerr said, ""It’s actually less than 10% of our foreign assistance dollars flowing through USAID is actually reaching those communities."" 
Unlock Aid, which formed in 2021, advocates for improvements to U.S. aid, did not respond to our emails requesting comment. 
Musk and Republican Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah, reshared the PBS interview, seeming to cite Kerr’s comments as evidence of USAID corruption.
Our ruling
Mast said when it comes to USAID, ""10 to 30 cents on the dollar is what actually goes to aid."" 
Mast appeared to be referring to a USAID report on 2024 funding that said about 12.1% of the agency’s money goes directly to small local organizations in foreign countries. 
But money provided to local partners is only one portion of the aid. The rest of the money is distributed through ""implementing partners"" —  organizations and companies that operate internationally and which are often based in the U.S. The implementing partners spend the money on food, medicine and other assistance in developing countries or pass it to local organizations based in those countries.

Musk, who has taken a leading role in President Donald Trump’s administration, has criticized U.S. aid to Ukraine and elsewhere. Leading the Department of Government Efficiency, a nongovernmental advisory board that Trump tasked with cutting federal costs, Musk has gained access to the U.S. Treasury’s payment system and is working to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development, an independent government organization codified in law that provides humanitarian and disaster aid abroad. 
A freeze on most foreign assistance has not stopped U.S. military aid to Ukraine, Zelenskyy said Jan. 25. But humanitarian organizations in Ukraine have had to halt services as their funding has stopped.
Here’s why claims of money laundering in Ukraine don’t hold up. 
Congressional funding
Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Congress has passed five bills to aid Ukraine’s war effort, totalling nearly $175 billion. Executive action and supplemental appropriations have provided additional funding. 
That money was not wired directly to Ukraine’s government, though. A Council on Foreign Relations breakdown shows that out of the $175 billion Congress has appropriated, about $100 billion worth of aid is being sent to Ukraine. The rest is funding U.S. activities associated with the war and other countries in the region, the Council on Foreign Relations said. 
The aid to Ukraine comes mostly as weapons shipments and other military support. Only about $33 billion was dedicated to direct budget support, the Council on Foreign Relations reported. About $70 billion of the value going directly to Ukraine is in weapons, equipment and other military support. 
A large portion of the money to support Ukraine’s war effort is spent in the U.S., Mark Cancian, an analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank said in a 2023 analysis: It is going to domestic weapons manufacturers to produce weapons for Ukraine and to replace equipment that was already sent from American stockpiles. 
""Funding of US agencies, most of the funding for US military forces, most of the military equipment backfill and Ukrainian equipment purchases, and a part of the humanitarian assistance stay in the United States,"" Cancian said in the 2023 article.
Also, not all of the money dedicated for Ukraine has been spent yet, and Zelenskyy in the circulated video appeared to be discussing the funding the country has received to date. According to the Special Inspector General for Operation Atlantic Resolve, the multiagency watchdog that oversees Ukraine funding, $86.7 billion of the $130 billion obligated to Ukraine had been disbursed by Sept. 30, 2024. 
What Zelenskyy said
In the AP interview, Zelenskyy said the actual military assistance Ukraine has received to fight the war is lower than the top-line dollar figure in the aid packages.
The AP has posted portions of the interview, but Zelenskyy’s office posted the full hourlong video on its YouTube page in Ukrainian. A clip from that interview spread on social media with English captions. The video has a label from ""@Smotri_Media,"" a Russian Telegram group.  
In the clip’s English translation, Zelenskyy said that the country received ""just over"" $75 billion in military aid. He noted that areas other than the military received U.S. aid.

By Maria Briceño • February 5, 2025
""One-hundred billion (dollars) of these 177, or 200, some people even say, we have never received,"" Zelenskyy said, according to the translation of the clip. ""We are talking about specific things, because we got it not with money but with weapons. We got $70 something billion worth of it. There is training, there is additional transport. There are not only prices for weapons, there were humanitarian programs, social et cetera.""
It was not clear what exactly Zelenskyy was including in his accounting of the military support Ukraine has received, but his comments align with the public data on how Ukraine aid is being spent. 
The money is not missing or laundered, as some posts claimed. It’s being spent as Congress intended: on U.S. weapons manufacturing, nonmilitary support in Ukraine and support elsewhere in the region.
That’s not to say that Ukrainian aid is never misappropriated. In 2024, Ukraine’s security services investigated Ukrainian defense officials over alleged corruption in a $40 million arms purchase. But Zelenskyy’s statements aren’t evidence of widespread fraud or money laundering in Ukraine aid. 
Inspectors general from the Defense and State departments and the U.S. Agency for International Development have overseen Ukraine aid and have published dozens of audits and assessments of funding programs since 2022. Their review has uncovered no widespread abuse of aid to Ukraine. The U.S. State Department said in August ""there remains no credible evidence of illicit diversion of U.S.-provided defense equipment, direct budget support, or humanitarian assistance from Ukraine.""
The Fraud and Corruption Investigative Working Group, under the special inspector general for Ukraine oversight, opened 61 investigations and closed 30 of them from July to September 2024. 
Our ruling
Social media posts claimed that Zelenskyy ""threw the whole Ukraine money laundering operation under the bus.""
Zelenskyy said Ukraine has received only about $75 billion in military assistance of the $175 billion the U.S. has dedicated to Ukraine aid. That’s in line with what researchers monitoring funding to Ukraine have observed.
A large portion of the money stayed in the U.S. and a smaller portion went to other countries in the region.

A false flag is an incident, such as an attack, that’s designed to look like as if one person or party perpetrated it, although someone else did. Historically, the term referred to a military force. Now, baseless rumors about ""false flag"" incidents are common on social media after significant news events, such as mass shootings.
We found no evidence the deadliest aviation disaster in more than a decade was a false flag. All 64 passengers and crew members aboard American Airlines flight 5342 and all three people inside the Black Hawk helicopter were killed after a low-altitude midair collision above the Potomac River. Investigators are still evaluating its cause. 
The evidence presented in the social media posts does not prove it was orchestrated for a covert purpose.
CNN did not report on the collision before it happened. 
On Jan. 30, FBI divers recovered the American Airlines plane’s flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder. Using the data recovered from the planes, National Transportation Safety Board officials released a timeline of the collision. The plane recorded sounds of impact at 8:47:59 p.m. EST, officials said Feb. 1.
We used the Nexis news archive to search CNN reports and transcripts for mentions of ""plane"" and ""Potomac"" and ""collision"" or ""crash"" on Jan. 29. That returned only three results — transcripts of CNN’s shows from 9 p.m. EST to 12 a.m. EST. The transcript of CNN’s ""The Source with Kaitlan Collins"" shows the crash was first reported at about 9:30 p.m.
""Some breaking news this hour, as a small plane has just crashed into the Potomac River, here in Washington, near the Ronald Reagan Airport, just outside Washington, D.C.,"" Collins said. ""That’s according to the D.C. Fire Department.""

The earliest entry on CNN’s live crash updates web page was posted at 9:40 p.m. Time stamps from CNN’s video reports about the crash show they happened after the collision at 9:49 p.m. and 10:23 p.m. 
Publication data from other news organizations that republish CNN’s wire content corroborate that CNN’s reports came after the crash. 
WRAL, a North Carolina TV news channel and PolitiFact North Carolina partner, posted a CNN story about the crash at 9:42 p.m. — about an hour after the crash.

WRCB, a Chattanooga, Tennessee, TV news channel, also posted the CNN story at 9:40 p.m., according to the page’s metadata. 
Our ruling
Social media posts claimed that CNN reported on the Potomac River plane and helicopter crash ""hours before it happened.""
There’s no evidence that CNN reported on the Jan. 29 fatal collision hours before the event occurred. CNN began reporting on the crash after it happened, according to available report time stamps and a CNN spokesperson’s statement.

Ashley Moody, R-Fla., said at a hearing that a human trafficking tip line stopped reporting cases to law enforcement.

Moody joined fellow lawmakers on the Senate Judiciary Committee to question President Donald Trump’s pick for FBI director, Kash Patel, during his Jan. 30 confirmation hearing.

""It might shock you to know that the National Human Trafficking Hotline that was funded by Congress to report tips to law enforcement, in the last four years decided that they would no longer report tips to law enforcement, that they would take a more victim-centered approach,"" Moody said. ""This fell in line with a lot of what we saw over the last four years, with people saying things like, defund the police, abolish the police, nonsense policies that lead to an explosion in crime.""

In 2024, Moody worked with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to launch a statewide human trafficking tip line after concerns the national hotline was failing to give tips to local law enforcement in a timely way.
PolitiFact found no announcements from the National Human Trafficking Hotline signaling any reporting policy shift over the last four years. The only mention of a potential change came in a 2023 letter that multiple state attorneys general, including Moody, signed that recounted comments from a hotline executive who said the service was ""beginning to transition away"" from serving as a tip line.
Rafael Avalos, a spokesperson for the hotline’s parent company, told PolitiFact in an email that the service has not changed its reporting policies. 
""The instances in which the National Human Trafficking Hotline reports to law enforcement have remained consistent for more than 10 years,"" Avalos wrote.
The hotline says it reports tips to law enforcement and prioritizes obtaining victims’ consent before alerting authorities. The organization, on its website, said it alerts authorities, with or without victim consent, in cases involving imminent harm, child sex abuse or when required by law.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
PolitiFact emailed Moody’s office for evidence but received no reply.
The national hotline’s origins
The National Human Trafficking Hotline was born out of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, a federal law that recognized human trafficking as a crime. Its mandate is to connect human trafficking victims with social services and notify police about potential trafficking ""as requested or required by law"" within 24 hours, according to grant materials The Washington Post cited.
Polaris Project, a nonprofit organization working to reduce sex and labor trafficking in North America, has run the service since 2007. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and private donors fund it.
Federal law requires that the hotline’s phone number be posted in all federal buildings, at every port of entry and in airport, bus station and train station restrooms.

The hotline’s website outlines how the organization decides when to report to authorities. It says the organization ""respects an individual's right to make the decision regarding whether or not to report information about his/her experience to law enforcement or other parties,"" and recognizes that informing law enforcement ""can lead to increased investigations and prosecutions, deter future trafficking, and help victims safely exit situations of human trafficking.""

""Whenever possible, the Trafficking Hotline endeavors to speak directly with victims to discuss the various reporting and referral options and receive explicit consent to make a report on his/her behalf,"" the FAQ page says. ""Consent from a victim and the safety of any individuals involved are the most important factors the Trafficking Hotline considers when weighing whether or not to make a report.""
In a 2020 grant application that The Washington Post reviewed, the Health and Human Services Department wrote that the hotline ""must defer to the individual seeking assistance on if, and when, to report their case to law enforcement, unless required to do otherwise by state-mandated child welfare reporting requirements.""

Other hotlines, such as the National Sexual Abuse Hotline, operate similarly. They keep calls from adult victims confidential and allow victims to decide whether to involve police. 
The hotline received more than 30,000 calls, texts and emails in 2023, according to Polaris data and identified 7,380 unique cases of potential human trafficking. The organization said it refers about a third of those potential cases to police.
Attorneys general claims of recent reporting change
The claim about a recent reporting change could stem from a 2022 meeting between Republican Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch and Polaris CEO Catherine Chen. 

Thirty-six attorneys general signed a 2023 letter to congressional leaders that mentioned the meeting.

""It has recently come to our attention that the National Human Trafficking Hotline (""Hotline""), which Congress has funded for 15 years, is not reporting tips of adult trafficking to state law enforcement except under the limited circumstance where the victim self-reports and affirmatively consents to the Hotline making the report,"" the letter says. ""Not only do we believe this action contravenes one of Congress’ intended functions of the Hotline, but we believe it disrupts the federal-state partnership to end human trafficking and help its victims.""

The letter said Fitch expressed concern during the meeting with Chen about what she said was a lack of tips to Mississippi authorities from the hotline. The letter said Chen told Fitch the hotline takes a victim-centered approach that weighs potential adverse consequences to victims, and that it ""was beginning to transition away from serving as a tip line to concentrate more on connecting survivors with resources.""

PolitiFact asked Fitch for data showing the number of reports Mississippi law enforcement received from tips but received no reply. We found no data on the hotline’s website or elsewhere that details the number of hotline tips reported to law enforcement over the years. 
Fitch’s office told The Washington Post in July 2023 that a 2021 case drew attention to the issue. The Post reported that a man called the hotline after hearing from an out-of-state friend who needed help and the hotline said it couldn’t do anything. Fitch’s office told the newspaper it was alarmed to learn that many third-party tips are not referred to police. 
In interviews with The Post, Polaris acknowledged delays in sharing information received via email and webchats, which they said are intended for ""nonurgent communications,"" during a three-month period of staffing shortages in 2022. But the organization pushed back on other criticism.

In a March 2023 response to the attorneys general letter, Polaris said that concerns raised about its reporting practices were based on a misunderstanding of the hotline’s mission.

""The Trafficking Hotline is not primarily a law enforcement tip line, but rather is authorized by Congress and funded by HHS to ‘assist victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons in communicating with service providers,’"" the statement said.

The hotline ""works with victims to determine what they need to begin to break free and rebuild their lives,"" the statement said. ""This is important because traffickers take consent, choice, and freedom away from victims.""

Polaris said it ""actively partner(s) with hundreds of law enforcement agencies all over the country to ensure countless traffickers are arrested and justice is served.""

In April 2023, U.S. Reps. Laurel M. Lee, R-Fla., and Kathy Castor, D-Fla., introduced the National Human Trafficking Hotline Enhancement Act that would compel the hotline to provide information from calls to law enforcement on request. The bill made it through committee but never got consideration on the House floor. 
PolitiFact asked Polaris whether the attorneys general letter accurately represented Chen’s comments, and if Chen had been describing a policy shift when she met with Fitch. Polaris pointed us to the 2023 Washington Post story with comments from Chen.

""We believe law enforcement has to be part of the solution,"" The Post quotes Chen as saying. ""But this idea that you can mandate that the hotline report every single bit of information whenever it is that law enforcement wants it fundamentally reverses the trust that we’re trying to build with victims and survivors. And they will absolutely stop calling us."" 
Our ruling
Moody said the National Human Trafficking Hotline decided in the last four years to ""no longer report tips to law enforcement"" and to take a more victim-centered approach.
The hotline says it reports tips to law enforcement authorities but prioritizes obtaining victims’ consent first. The organization also alerts authorities, with or without victim consent, in cases involving imminent harm, child sex abuse, or when required by law. The organization said it consistently refers about one-third of human trafficking victims to law enforcement.
PolitiFact found no announcements that signaled a reporting policy change over the last four years. A hotline spokesperson said its policies have remained consistent for more than a decade.
Moody provided no evidence to back her claim.
At PolitiFact, the burden of proof is on the speaker. Lacking evidence to support the claim, we rate it False.

Birthright citizenship refers to the constitutional guarantee, laid out in the 14th Amendment, that all children born in the United States is automatically a U.S. citizen, even if their parents are in the country illegally.
As one of his first acts in office, Trump signed an executive order aiming to end automatic citizenship for children born in the U.S. if neither their mother or father is a U.S. citizen or a lawful permanent resident. The order was immediately challenged in court, and a federal judge temporarily blocked it. The Trump administration has promised to appeal. 
Many Republicans, including members of Congress from Wisconsin, have backed Trump’s position on reinterpreting birthright citizenship.
That includes U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., who discussed the topic Jan. 26 on WISN-TV’s Sunday morning show ""Upfront.""

""We’re one of the very few nations that allowed birthright citizenship,"" Johnson said. ""It’s kind of crazy that this is the policy of the United States.""
""I’m not sure the people passing the 14th Amendment would anticipate wide open borders and this flood of illegal immigrants coming uncontrolled into this country, somewhat incentivized by birthright citizenship,"" he said.
Johnson has previously expressed support for ending birthright citizenship, including at a Senate hearing in December. Then, he said the U.S. is in the ""minority"" of countries that grant it.
With so much attention on birthright citizenship, PolitiFact Wisconsin thought Johnson’s claim was interesting. Is the U.S. an outlier in offering automatic citizenship to children born here?
Let’s take a look.
35 countries have birthright citizenship, including Mexico and Canada
PolitiFact National checked a similar claim from Trump earlier in January, when he falsely said the U.S. is the only country with birthright citizenship. 
About three dozen countries offer automatic citizenship to people born in the country, without restrictions. Countries with restrictions, for example, might require one parent to be born there or a citizen.
We presented the 35 number to Johnson’s office and asked for evidence and context to back up his statement. His spokeswoman, Kiersten Pels, noted that ""35 of 195 (total countries) is only 18 percent of countries.""
""Additionally, Canada and the U.S. are the only two ""developed"" nations (according to IMF) to allow it,"" she said.
That refers to the International Monetary Fund’s distinction between countries with ""advanced economies,"" such as the U.S. and Canada, versus ""emerging and developing economies."" 
Other populous countries that provide unrestricted birthright citizenship, but are under the IMF’s ""emerging and developing"" category, include Mexico and Brazil.

Interestingly, nearly all countries that offer it are in North America, South America or the Caribbean: A product of colonial times, when immigration was encouraged to populate settlements in the ""New World.""
""The American conception of citizenship is informed by the English common law doctrine of jus soli (""right of soil""), in which a person’s nationality at birth is determined by the territory where that person is born,"" according to the Cornell Law School’s Legal Information Institute.
Some countries have recently done away with unrestricted birthright citizenship and added conditions, including Ireland in 2005 and New Zealand in 2006. 
Our ruling
Johnson said the U.S. is one of a ""very few"" nations with birthright citizenship. 
Thirty-five nations have it, but ""very few"" is a pretty subjective number when compared to 195 total countries. PolitiFact Wisconsin took that into account when rating the claim. 
Johnson’s initial claim was True when he said the U.S. is in the ""minority"" of countries that offer it — if 18 percent of countries have it, that’s certainly not a majority. 
But the U.S. isn’t an anomaly either, at least on this side of the world. Canada and Mexico, two very large countries next to the U.S., both have birthright citizenship.

We’ve fact-checked similar false claims about at-large serial killers and missing children in multiple neighborhoods.
The Better Business Bureau has warned about these kinds of bait-and-switch scams before. They work like this: Someone is scrolling through Facebook and sees a post about a wanted serial killer. The person shares the post. But after the person shares the post, the scammer changes the post to something, such as a deceptive rental ad.
""These bait-and-switch ads aim to either get a deposit for a rental property before the user gets a chance to see the home — or get your personal information, which could lead to identity theft,"" the Better Business Bureau said in a November 2024 article. ""This scheme has many variations, but the commonality is the emotionality or urgency of the message that encourages concerned people to share the news with their friends.""

""Immediately after he announced his intent to send 90,000 superfluous IRS agents to the border, 1,500 tendered letters of resignation, writing that their training was incompatible with border duty,"" the article read, referring to Trump.
Republicans have long spread claims about the IRS hiring 87,000 employees. That figure stems from a 2021 Treasury Department report that projects that $80 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act could create about 86,852 full-time equivalent IRS positions. But that plan wasn’t final, and hiring for those positions would be incremental through 2031.

"Donald Trump
stated on January 30, 2025 in a press briefing:",“I changed the Obama policy (on hiring air traffic controllers) ... And then Biden came in and he changed it.”,"stated on January 30, 2025 in a press briefing:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/jan/31/donald-trump/trump-faults-dei-hiring-in-plane-crash-and-falsely/,,"Hours after a plane crashed over the Potomac River a few miles from the White House, President Donald Trump held a press briefing in which he blamed his predecessors’ diversity hiring policies as a possible reason for the accident.
Sixty-seven people were presumed dead after an American Airlines passenger jet collided in midair with a U.S. Army helicopter near the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport on Jan. 29. The victims included three U.S. service members aboard the helicopter and everyone aboard the plane, including several young figure skaters, a civil rights lawyer, a newlywed, a pilot and several flight attendants. 
Trump started his Jan. 30 press conference with a moment of silence but pivoted to blame Democratic Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, who Trump said led Federal Aviation Administration diversity programs that inspired the agency to hire unqualified air traffic control employees. Trump said he ended those initiatives in 2017 when he was first elected, but Biden reinstated them.
""I changed the Obama policy, and we had a very good policy,"" Trump said. ""And then Biden came in and he changed it. And then when I came in two days, three days ago, I signed a new order, bringing it to the highest level of intelligence.""
Trump read from a Fox News headline that said the Federal Aviation Administration diversity hiring initiative ""includes focus on hiring people with severe intellectual and psychiatric disabilities."" Trump said it came out a week before he took office, but it was published Jan. 14, 2024. After the press conference, the White House also pointed to an Obama-era biographical assessment for air traffic controllers that critics said prioritized diversity over skills.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
A close look at the FAA’s hiring policies under Obama, Biden and Trump shows that Trump mischaracterized the policies and misled about his actions and the actions of his White House predecessors. He also provided no evidence these policies had any connection to the fatal crash.
The crash has generated renewed concerns about air traffic controller staffing, and the cause remains under investigation. Experts warned against singling out any specific cause of the crash, including diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, less than 24 hours after it occurred. 
Trump expanded — not withdrew — a hiring initiative aimed at people with disabilities
In 2010, Obama’s administration issued an executive order directing federal agencies to hire more people with disabilities, noting that although 54 million people in the U.S. have disabilities, they were underrepresented in the federal workforce. The FAA incorporated the directive into its hiring practices.
That didn’t stop when Trump took office in 2017. Archives of the FAA’s website show the agency continually highlighted its diversity hiring initiatives, including its aims to hire people with disabilities, from 2013 up until Trump reclaimed office in 2025, including throughout Trump’s first term, 2017 to 2021. The page was taken down after Trump was inaugurated Jan. 20.
During his Jan. 30 press conference, Trump maligned a list of ""targeted disabilities,"" including severe intellectual disabilities, saying their emphasis in hiring was unique to his predecessors.  
The term ""targeted disabilities"" is legally defined across the federal government to include ""hearing, vision, missing extremities, partial paralysis, complete paralysis, epilepsy, severe intellectual disability, psychiatric disability and dwarfism.""
Yet in 2019, also under Trump’s first term, the FAA launched a program that aimed to hire 20 people with disabilities to be air traffic controllers, including people who have these ""targeted disabilities.""
In its April 11, 2019, press release, the agency said the program’s key focus was to ""identify specific opportunities for people with targeted disabilities, empower them and facilitate their entry into a more diverse and inclusive workforce.""
After being sworn in for his second term, Trump on Jan. 20 and Jan. 22 signed executive orders aimed at shutting down diversity programs in the federal government, including the FAA. 
The White House confirmed Jan. 30 that Trump’s executive orders did away with those goals.  
Trump ended a controversial Obama-era hiring protocol, but Biden did not reinstate it
In 2014, the Obama administration launched a hiring assessment for air traffic controllers that weighed biographical information such as work and education experience and personality traits as part of a person’s application. The training standards for those who were hired didn’t change.
The assessment did not ask specifically about race, but critics said it was designed to create a more diverse hiring pool at the expense of people who were more qualified or performed better on skills tests. People who failed were not allowed to continue with their application. The FAA introduced the assessment into its hiring protocol in 2014 after it commissioned a study of the barriers racial minorities and women face in becoming air traffic controllers.
Throughout his first term, the Trump administration defended the Transportation Department in a lawsuit over the assessment, which plaintiffs said was discriminatory. Trump’s administration and Biden’s administration both denied in court that the process favored nonwhite applicants. Nevertheless, in 2018, Trump jettisoned its use of the air control biographical assessment, the White House said.
Biden’s administration did not reinstate the assessment, and it has not been a part of the application process since 2018.

“The VIP on the Black Hawk helicopter that crashed was Barack Obama.”
By Sofia Ahmed • January 30, 2025
All air traffic controllers undergo rigorous tests regardless of disability
All air traffic controllers need to pass skills and medical tests to be hired, air traffic management experts told PolitiFact. That didn’t change under either hiring initiative. 
Some disabilities could be disqualifying, Margaret Wallace, an aviation management professor at Florida Institute of Technology, said. Some examples could include heart conditions or neurological issues that might unexpectedly incapacitate a person, or ""poor or no vision, color blindness, poor or no hearing, speech issues that could affect the ability to communicate as needed,"" Wallace said.
Michael McCormick retired from the FAA in 2015 after working under Republican and Democrat administrations, and his work included hiring controllers. He said most of the conditions Trump listed would not meet the agency’s medical standards. 
""The decision to hire a controller is solely based upon aptitude testing, medical certification and security investigation,"" McCormick said. 
Our ruling
As he speculated about the Jan. 29 air crash’s cause, Trump said ""I changed the Obama policy (on hiring air traffic controllers) ... And then Biden came in and he changed it.""
The White House said he was referring to two separate policies. 
The first was a push to hire more people with disabilities that started under Obama. Trump didn’t end the initiative — he expanded the effort by announcing a program aimed at hiring 20 people with disabilities to be air traffic controllers. All air traffic controllers had to pass medical, security and skills tests, regardless of any disability.
The second involved an Obama-era hiring assessment that critics said prioritized diversity over qualifications. Trump was wrong to say that Biden reinstated it — he did not. The assessment has not been in place since 2018, when Trump ended it. But even under that practice, training standards did not change.
Trump conflated policies, obfuscated about his role in them and misled about what they did.
Investigators are still piecing together what led to the crash, a process that could take months. Trump’s leap to connect these policies to what unfolded over the Potomac has no basis.

Trump has suggested eliminating the agency, something that would require congressional action. He ordered a council form to review the agency and deliver a report in six months. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Congress may want to attach conditions, such as a debt limit increase, to California aid.
That’s a ""shameful"" idea, Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Jan. 26 on NBC’s ""Meet the Press.""  
Schiff said Congress should not tie unrelated policy objectives to aid or view disaster aid requests through a partisan lens. 
""And let me say this, as a Californian, we have given more to the recovery of other states than any other state in the union,"" Schiff said.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
Responding to Johnson’s comments calling the idea of conditioning California aid ""a common-sense notion,"" U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., echoed Schiff’s sentiment. 
""California is the largest contributor of tax revenue to the federal treasury by far,"" Padilla wrote Jan. 27 on X. ""In 2022 alone, California paid $83 billion more to the federal government than it received. Louisiana took $34.5 billion more federal dollars than it paid. Who is subsidizing whom here?""
We heard similar statements during Trump’s first presidency that California is a ""donor"" state – sending more money to the federal government than it gets in return. We found that Schiff cited a credible academic analysis, which requires some explanation.
How a policy group calculates states’ ‘balance of payments’
A Schiff spokesperson cited analysis from the Rockefeller Institute of Government, a public policy arm of the State University of New York.
For several years, the institute has examined the amount of federal taxes paid by each state’s residents and businesses compared with the amount of federal funding the state receives. The institute refers to the difference of those two numbers as the state’s ""balance of payments"" — a phrase used by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. who was elected to the Senate in 1976 and served 24 years.
The institute’s most recent analysis, published in 2024, showed that California’s balance of payments was greater than any other state in the nation. 
California paid $83.1 billion more in federal taxes than it received from the federal government — a difference greater than any other state when measured in sheer dollars.
The state remained a standout when its population was considered, but it didn’t lead all states. The analysis showed that per capita, Californians paid $2,129 more in federal taxes than they received — that’s more than all but three other states.
So, Schiff was right that California’s federal funding contributions far outweigh what it gets from the federal government in return, but the disaster aid comparison is not as much of a straight line.
""The federal government does not have a separate, dedicated revenue stream exclusively for disaster aid,"" said Joel Tirado, an institute spokesperson. ""FEMA funding comes from general revenue aggregated nationally. So, it isn’t possible to know how much of California’s taxes go to disaster relief specifically.""

“Donald Trump is reportedly furious with Elon Musk for convincing him to push out the head of the FAA because Musk was mad SpaceX got fined last September by the FAA for license violations.”
By Sofia Ahmed • January 31, 2025
Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the Tax Foundation, a center-right think tank, said policymakers in states such as California sometimes object that their taxpayers are subsidizing other states' taxpayers. But taxpayers are not being treated differently from one state to another. Low-income and high-income taxpayers will receive the same treatment whether they live in California, Nebraska or Arkansas, Walczak said.
""The difference is that California has more high earners than other states, and under a progressive tax and transfer system, high earners face progressively higher tax burdens which serve, in part, to fund programs that benefit lower-income households,"" Walczak said. ""It's not that Californians are subsidizing Arkansans: it's that high earners in California and Arkansas and everywhere else face higher tax burdens than low earners in California and Arkansas and everywhere else."" 
Joshua Sewell, research and policy director at Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan taxpayer advocacy group, said he agreed with Schiff’s general point because California’s economy and its contributions to federal revenues exceed every other state.
""That’s because federal lawmakers have taken those commingled funds generated from the income tax, customs duties, and excise taxes and redistributed them through federal programs,"" Sewell said.
Brad Franklin, a research fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, a nonpartisan think tank, said disaster response programs are implemented by many agencies and departments, which receive most of their funding from supplemental appropriations. 
""That money ultimately comes from tax receipts, and California definitely pays more than its share,"" Franklin said. ""Putting things in per capita terms, as (the Rockefeller report) did, is helpful for thinking about tax burden per person. But total receipts are much more relevant to this question.""
Our ruling
Schiff said, ""As a Californian, we have given more to the recovery of other states than any other state in the union."" 
Schiff was citing the Rockefeller Institute of Government’s analysis of 2022 data. It showed California paid $83 billion to the federal government more than it received. This is not surprising since California is the most populous state. When that difference is calculated per capita, however, the figures showed that, compared with California, three other states paid more to the federal government than they received.

But one crack in his plan is that egg prices haven’t fallen since he took office Jan. 20.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, in her first on-camera press briefing Jan. 28, blamed that on former President Joe Biden’s ""inflationary policies.""
Leavitt said the Biden administration and the U.S. Agriculture Department ""directed the mass killing of more than 100 million chickens, which has led to a lack of chicken supply in this country, therefore a lack of egg supply, which is leading to the shortage.""
Leavitt’s statement is partially accurate about the culling of millions of chickens, but she omitted important details and context about why that happened.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
First, the chickens were killed to prevent the spread of the highly pathogenic avian influenza, or bird flu. 
Second, it’s been long-standing USDA policy to cull an entire flock of birds once bird flu has been detected, including during Trump’s first administration.
White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly referred PolitiFact back to Leavitt’s press briefing comments. 
Egg prices rose under Biden — from $1.60 per dozen in February 2021 to $4.10 in December 2024 (his first and last full months in office), Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows. The Agriculture Department’s January food price outlook said egg prices could rise about 20% more this year.
A spokesperson for Expana, a company that tracks consumer prices, told Axios that a dozen large eggs costs more than $7 in some U.S. regions. 
Since Feb. 8, 2022, when the virus was detected in a commercial flock, more than 147 million birds, including chickens, turkeys, ducks and geese, have died, the USDA said. 
USDA data shows 108 million egg-laying chickens died since 2022, including 13 million in 2025. It’s not clear how many were euthanized or died of the virus.
As of Jan. 29, bird flu has also been detected in dairy cattle, affecting 944 herds in 16 states, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows. Humans have also tested positive for the virus — 67 confirmed cases have been reported in the U.S. and one person has died, the CDC said.
Why are flocks culled?
Experts told PolitiFact the birds are culled to stop the virus from spreading. This protects not only nearby farms and the poultry industry, but public health. A 2002 federal law, the Animal Health Protection Act, gives the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service authority to depopulate herds and flocks to stop the disease’s spread.
""If the birds are dead, the virus dies along with them,"" Russ Daly, a veterinarian for the South Dakota Department of Health and a South Dakota State University professor, said.
Chickens that contract the bird flu virus have little chance of survival; 90% to 100% of them die, usually within 48 hours, the CDC said.
Waiting for the chickens to die naturally allows more viral load into the atmosphere, making it more dangerous for the farm workers and other people who come in contact with the farm, Jada Thompson, a University of Arkansas agricultural economics and agribusiness associate professor, said.
Is this policy new?
Several veterinary professors told PolitiFact that depopulation or ""stamping out"" of sick birds is a long-standing policy and pointed to a 2015 bird flu outbreak during the Obama administration.
Depopulation is the USDA’s primary control and eradication strategy for avian influenza, Yuko Sato, a veterinarian and Iowa State University associate professor, said.

""This latest outbreak is devastating because of the large numbers of premises involved since 2022,"" Carol Cardona, a University of Minnesota veterinary professor and chair of avian health, said. ""But the rule has been there for a very long time now.""
A 2016 USDA report shows that depopulation in 2015 resulted in 50 million birds killed.
A USDA bird flu response plan, updated in May 2017 during Trump’s first administration, incorporates policy guidance based on lessons from influenza outbreaks during the Obama and first Trump administrations. It said ""rapid depopulation of infected poultry is critical to halt virus transmission and must be prioritized.""
During a March 2017 bird flu outbreak, a USDA report said, ""nearly 253,000 birds were depopulated.""  
How does depopulation work?
The USDA encourages farmers who notice signs of illness to contact the USDA or their state veterinarian. Samples taken from the animals are tested and the USDA confirms cases; depopulation usually takes place within 48 hours of the virus’s confirmation.
The USDA pays the farmers for the killed birds.
""It’s in the best interest of the farmer to get this done quickly, as the USDA provides indemnity payments for the euthanized birds, but not the ones that die naturally,"" Daly said.
Our ruling
Leavitt said there’s an egg shortage because the Biden administration ""directed the mass killing of more than 100 million chickens.""
During the Biden administration, more than 100 million egg-laying chickens died from bird flu or were killed to stop the virus’ spread. This led to an egg shortage and higher prices. 
Depopulation is a long-standing practice to prevent bird flu from spreading, agriculture experts said. Government documents show depopulation was the USDA’s bird flu strategy during Trump’s first term and during the 2015 outbreak under Obama.

When asked whether Pfizer had released a new list of vaccine side effects, a company spokesperson pointed us to a webpage posted Oct. 1, 2024, for the Comirnaty Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, an updated vaccine that targets new COVID-19 variants.

Kennedy Jr.’s Jan. 29 Senate confirmation hearing, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., grilled Kennedy over his involvement in lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers.
""In the past two years, you’ve raked in $2.5 million from a law firm called Wisner Baum,"" Warren said. ""You go online, you do commercials to encourage people to sign up with Wisner Baum to join lawsuits against vaccine makers.""
Warren said Kennedy gets paid for everyone who signs up, and if Wisner Baum wins the case, Kennedy receives 10% of the legal fees.
""Have we had a single nominee come through who’s made $2.5 million off suing one of the entities that it would be regulating, and plans to keep getting a take of every lawsuit in the future?"" Warren asked Senate Finance Committee chairman Mike Crapo, R-Idaho.
When PolitiFact contacted Warren’s office, a spokesperson clarified that the senator was referring to Wisner Baum suing pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. over allegations it failed to properly warn patients about risks associated with Gardasil, the vaccine that protects against human papillomavirus. HPV is a common sexually transmitted disease that can cause cancers later in life.

Over the past two years, Kennedy collectively earned more than $2.4 million as a consultant referring cases to Wisner Baum, according to financial records he filed with the federal government for his health secretary nomination and 2024 presidential run. Warren’s office pointed to these financial records as evidence to support the senator’s hearing remarks.
PolitiFact also contacted Kennedy’s team, but received no response before publication.
Kennedy’s financial records show that in 2024, Wisner Baum paid Kennedy $856,559 for his consultant work.
In 2023, Kennedy earned $1,589,829 for his work at Wisner Baum, records show.
The documents don’t say for which cases Kennedy received compensation. A Wisner Baum spokesperson said in a statement responding to Warren’s hearing remarks that the law firm has not compensated Kennedy for vaccine cases. Wisner Baum said it has paid Kennedy only for cases related to the herbicide Roundup and 2018 California wildfires. Kennedy’s bio on Wisner Baum’s website lists his work on these cases, and the lawsuits against Merck.
As Health and Human Services secretary, Kennedy would oversee the Food and Drug Administration, an agency that regulates companies such as Merck and Monsanto, which produces Roundup.
Warren’s office said in a statement that the money Kennedy earned from Monsanto-related cases shows he has already profited from lawsuits against an entity he would oversee.

The first jury trial against Merck’s Gardasil vaccine began Jan. 21 in a state court in Los Angeles. Separately, there is an ongoing federal court case against Merck involving almost 200 lawsuits filed since 2022 in North Carolina, where one of Merck’s vaccine manufacturing facilities is based. Wisner Baum is involved in both cases.
Kennedy wrote in his ethics agreement that, if confirmed as health secretary, he would resign from his Wisner Baum consultant position, which he has held since 2016. However, Kennedy said he will continue to receive compensation from the firm for certain cases.
""I am entitled to receive 10% of fees awarded in contingency fee cases referred to the firm,"" Kennedy wrote in his ethics agreement. ""I am not trying these cases, I am not an attorney of record for the cases, and I will not provide representational services in connection with the cases during my appointment to the position of Secretary.""
Kennedy wrote that, if confirmed, he will receive one final payment from Wisner Baum for all completed cases involving the U.S. government. This includes claims filed under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, a federal program established in 1986 that allows people who say they were injured by vaccines to seek compensation. The disclosure documents did not say how much that payment is expected to be.
For ongoing and future legal cases involving the U.S. government, Kennedy wrote that he will not receive payment. However, if the Department of Health and Human Services’ ethics office says the government is not a party in a case and doesn’t have a ""direct or substantial interest,"" the ethics agreement said, then Kennedy can collect contingency fee interest from Wisner Baum.
So, if Kennedy is confirmed as health secretary, he could receive substantial compensation from Wisner Baum for his previous referral work in the event the law firm wins or settles its cases against Merck.
Following the hearing, Kennedy submitted written answers to the committee’s follow-up questions. In it, he wrote that he had not yet received compensation from Wisner Baum related to any lawsuit against Merck related to Gardasil. ""An amendment to my Ethics Agreement is in process, and it provides that I will divest my interest in any such litigation,"" he said.

When asked if he or any family members ""ever received, or expect to receive, any compensation from Wisner Baum from any lawsuit against Merck related to Gardasil,"" Kennedy wrote he was amending his ethics agreement to send any proceeds from the suit to go to his son. Kennedy did not say which son, although his son Conor Kennedy is an attorney at Wisner Baum.

“They’re still counting the (2024 election) vote in some areas.”
By Amy Sherman • January 7, 2025
Government documents show that Kennedy resigned from his positions as chairman and chief legal counsel for Children’s Health Defense in December 2024. He earned $326,056 in salary and benefits from the antivaccine group for three months of work in 2023 before taking an unpaid leave of absence April 1, 2023. A few days later, on April 5, 2023, Kennedy filed candidacy paperwork with the Federal Election Commission for his 2024 presidential run.
Kennedy has made numerous false claims about vaccines, including ones that protect against COVID-19 and HPV. These falsehoods were part of Kennedy’s presidential campaign of conspiracy theories that PolitiFact named the 2023 Lie of the Year.
Kennedy has said receiving the HPV vaccine Gardasil increases cervical cancer risk. There’s no evidence for that. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — an agency Kennedy will oversee if confirmed as Department of Health and Human Services secretary — said the HPV vaccine is safe and effective in preventing HPV infection. The CDC recommends two doses of the vaccine at ages 11 to 12.
The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia said that ""because the HPV vaccine is made using only a single protein from each type of the virus, it can’t cause HPV infection, and, therefore, it can’t cause cervical cancer or other cancers.""
Our ruling
Warren said Kennedy ""made $2.5 million off suing one of the entities that (he would be regulating) and plans to keep getting a take of every lawsuit in the future.""
Warren was referring to Kennedy’s consulting work for Wisner Baum. Kennedy’s financial records show he earned more than $2.4 million over two years from his work referring cases to Wisner Baum.
On its website, Wisner Baum touts Kennedy’s work on its vaccine-related litigation against Merck as well as on other cases. However, it’s not clear from Kennedy’s financial records which legal cases Wisner Baum has paid him for. The law firm asserts it has compensated Kennedy only for non-vaccine related litigation, including for cases related to the herbicide Roundup, which is owned by a company the FDA regulates.
If confirmed as health secretary, Kennedy said in an ethics agreement that he would continue to receive compensation from the law firm for certain legal cases. He said he would receive one last payment from Wisner Baum for his prior work on government-related cases, but would otherwise stop receiving payment for cases involving the U.S. government.
It is possible that adhering to that promise would still leave room for Kennedy to receive payment from cases related to companies he regulates, if the Department of Health and Human Services’ ethics office determines the lawsuits don’t involve the U.S. government.
In answer to follow-up questions to the committee, Kennedy later said he was amending his ethics agreement to divest his interest in any such litigation and said he would give future proceeds from such lawsuits to his son. 
Warren’s claim is partially accurate — Kennedy has received $2.4 million related to lawsuits, some of them involving entities he would regulate as health secretary, and an ethics agreement said he expects to continue to receive payment from a law firm engaged in suing pharmaceutical companies, although Kennedy later said he would change that to send any such payment to his son instead. But Warren omitted this important context: Kennedy’s financial disclosures don’t make clear what lawsuits he was paid for. The Wisner Baum law firm says Kennedy has been compensated only for non-vaccine-related cases.
The available evidence for this claim fits our definition of Half True.

But there’s no evidence that the U.S. had earmarked or spent $50 million for condoms for Gaza. A State Department spokesperson said on X that the freeze stopped $100 million in funding to Gaza which included funding for contraception. But the emergency relief group that, according to news outlets, would have received that aid, told PolitiFact it did not use U.S. funding for condoms.
There is a U.S. program that provides contraceptives internationally — and it spent $60 million worldwide in one year — but Gaza was not among the recipients, a 2024 U.S. Agency for International Development report said.
Here’s what we know about the funding the White House froze to Gaza, and the funding the U.S. gives other countries for contraceptives.
White House stopped $100 million of health aid to Gaza
State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in an X post that the department ""prevented $102 million in unjustified funding to a contractor in Gaza, including money for contraception.""
The state Department declined to say on the record what the full scope of those grants was, and it did not provide documentation PolitiFact requested before deadline. 
Multiple news outlets reported that state department officials said the administration stopped two $50 million tranches of funding for the International Medical Corps’ work in Gaza. The funding ""included"" family planning programming, which can include contraception, sexual health care and sexually transmitted disease prevention.
The International Medical Corps operates a range of emergency health services in Gaza, but spokesperson Todd Bernhardt told PolitiFact it has not used U.S. funding to buy or distribute condoms in Gaza. The organization is not focused on contraception, and there’s no evidence that $50 million of the funding was intended to pay for condoms. 
The International Medical Corps operates two field hospitals in Gaza, Bernhardt said, which serve around 33,000 civilians per month. It performs emergency maternal and newborn care and has helped deliver about 5,000 babies since the war in Gaza began, Bernhardt said. It operates a neonatal intensive care unit and a stabilization center for severely malnourished children. 
The group also provides care in pediatrics, orthopedics, pulmonology and cardiology, Bernhardt said.
""If the stop-work order remains in place, we will be unable to sustain these activities beyond the next week or so,"" Bernhardt said.
Since the war in Gaza began in October 2023, the International Medical Corps has received $68 million to support its operations, Bernhardt said. We weren’t able to review the details of the grant Leavitt referred to, but it is unlikely the group would receive close to three-fourths of all the funding it’s received so far for condoms alone. And the State Department did not respond to our request for more details on the grant. 
The Trump administration on Jan. 29 withdrew its memo that directed a freeze on most federal aid a day after a judge blocked the effort, but Leavitt said on X the funding freeze was still in place. The State Department did not say whether the planned Gaza aid would resume. 
No contraceptives funding went to Gaza in fiscal year 2023, the latest available data
For decades, the U.S. has invested in reproductive health and family planning programs worldwide. Public health groups distribute condoms in low-income countries primarily to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV.

From the U.S. Agency for International Development funding, “10 to 30 cents on the dollar is what actually goes to aid.”
By Amy Sherman • February 5, 2025
The U.S. ""is the largest donor to (family planning/reproductive health) in the world. It is also one of the largest purchasers and distributors of contraceptives internationally,"" according to a 2024 KFF report. 
The U.S. spends about $600 million annually on international family planning and reproductive health programs globally, the KFF report said. That includes things like birth spaces, STD testing, prenatal and postnatal care, and other interventions beyond contraception. 
According to USAID, it partners with 41 countries for its family planning and reproductive health program. Neither Israel nor Gaza and the West Bank are on the list. 
In fiscal year 2023, which ended in September 2023, the U.S. government spent $60 million on contraceptive care which includes condoms, a 2024 USAID report said. A small portion of that — $8.2 million — was spent on male and female condoms, with the rest going to other contraception methods. 
The majority of the funding, $54.3 million went to countries in Africa. The Middle East, where Gaza is, got the smallest funding share — about $45,000. All the funding to the Middle East went to Jordan; the report didn’t mention any funding to Israel or Gaza.
Most of USAID’s Family Planning Program funding is used on contraceptives other than condoms such as oral contraceptives, injectable contraceptives and contraceptive implants. Around $7 million went to condoms for men.
Gaza has around 2.14 million people, according to the CIA. If the U.S. spent $50 million on condoms it would have spent around $23 on condoms per person in Gaza or about $46 per male in Gaza. On average, condoms cost about $1 each, according to Planned Parenthood. That does not include a likely lower price for bulk purchases. 
Our ruling
Leavitt said officials found ""there was about to be $50 million taxpayer dollars that went out the door to fund condoms in Gaza."" 
The White House and State Department didn’t provide evidence the funding it blocked was intended solely for condoms. A State Department spokesperson said that the freeze stopped $100 million in funding to Gaza that included funding for contraception. But there’s no evidence  the emergency relief group that would have received that aid would have used it for condoms; a spokesperson for the group said it has not used any U.S. aid so far to procure or distribute condoms.
A separate U.S. program that provides contraceptives internationally spent $60 million worldwide in one year, but Gaza was not among the recipients.

There are problems with this TikTok video’s claims. First, Vance has not visited North Carolina since he was sworn in as vice president Jan. 20. (In December, after Trump’s victory, Vance and his wife, Usha visited Fairview, North Carolina, to meet with first responders and evaluate hurricane damage and recovery efforts.)
On Jan. 27, Vance traveled to Damascus, Virginia, to survey Hurricane Helene’s destruction and meet with local leaders to discuss the continuing response. In remarks there, Vance said the Virginia trip was his first as vice president. 
""This is, I think, my seventh day on the job,"" he said. ""And this is an incredible place to have my first official trip. I heard so many good stories of good people helping their neighbors rebuild.""
He said he’d heard countless stories of people volunteering time and money to help people repair or reconstruct their homes and businesses.
During his remarks, Vance criticized what he characterized as unhelpful federal bureaucracy. Some North Carolinians have complained that FEMA’s response — including the Transitional Sheltering Assistance program, which provides the hotel stays — is confusing, frustrating and too slow. 
Trump, meanwhile, visited North Carolina on Jan. 24 and promised the administration would increase ""housing solutions"" for the region that extend beyond measures such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s temporary hotel stays.  
Neither Vance nor Trump said hurricane victims in Virginia or North Carolina would be provided furnished apartments, however. 
When we searched using Google and the Nexis news archive, we found no credible reports or information supporting claims that Vance or the Trump administration had provided furnished apartments for Hurricane Helene victims in North Carolina.

When the claim circulated on X, community notes appended on the posts said the posts might have confused North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein’s Jan. 2 executive order to increase the state’s temporary housing supply with something the Trump administration had introduced. 
In one of his first acts as governor, Stein, a Democrat, waived procurement regulations and authorized the North Carolina Department of Public Safety to buy up to 1,000 transportable temporary housing units. Some of those units began arriving Jan. 17, WLOS-TV in Asheville, North Carolina, reported.
Stein’s office said questions about the federal government’s efforts should go to FEMA. PolitiFact contacted FEMA and received no response before publication. 
Justin Graney, North Carolina Emergency Management spokesperson, said the agency knew nothing about the TikTok video’s claim. 
""(North Carolina Emergency Management) is unaware that any disaster survivors reported to be living in tents have been provided with furnished apartments,"" he said, though he acknowledged it was possible such housing accommodations might be tied to a FEMA program. ""It is important to note that those living in tents have been approached multiple times by local government officials, state government officials, and FEMA personnel and have been provided with information on available programs and resources.""
He encouraged anyone living in a tent who needs assistance to call the North Carolina Disaster Case Management Program at 1-844-746-2326.

Trump visited North Carolina on Jan. 24, four months after Hurricane Helene made landfall and damaged more than 73,000 homes.
""Earlier this month, the Biden administration kicked 2,000 displaced North Carolinians out of their temporary housing into freezing 20-degree weather,"" Trump said in Swannanoa. He promised that ""under the Trump administration, the days of betrayal and neglect are over.""
The White House did not respond to our request seeking evidence. The number Trump cited matches a Jan. 11 Fox News report that said 2,000 North Carolina residents no longer met FEMA’s temporary housing eligibility requirements, and housing would continue for 3,600 households. 
Trump has a point in that several hundred North Carolina storm victims were told in January they had to leave their FEMA-funded hotels or motels because they no longer met the criteria for the stays. He misleads by overstating the number who lost eligibility, by omitting that they received three weeks’ notice to find new housing and by saying they were ejected into the cold.

Reviewing temporary housing eligibility after a disaster and removing some people from the program is a standard FEMA procedure that also happened during his presidency.
Trump has floated the idea of eliminating FEMA, which would require congressional action. On Jan. 24, Trump ordered the formation of a council to review FEMA. 
FEMA announced extensions of transitional housing program
FEMA’s Transitional Sheltering Assistance program provides free hotel and motel rooms for disaster victims as they repair their homes or find other housing.
On Dec. 5, a FEMA news release said the temporary housing program in North Carolina was extended to Jan. 11. Of the 10,000 households that had used the program, about half had found longer-term housing. 
The agency reviews the participants’ cases every two weeks to see whether the participants still meet eligibility criteria. 
In January, multiple news reports said the Jan. 11 deadline would leave 2,000 to 3,500 households unsheltered during a snowstorm. (FEMA announced a 24-hour extension because of the storm.) 
About 3,600 households would remain eligible after Jan. 11, Fox reported.
On the night of Jan. 11, FEMA extended the transitional sheltering hotel stays deadline until Jan. 14 and then extended it again until Jan. 25.
North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein wrote a Jan. 16 letter to FEMA asking for an extension until Sept. 30 for eligible households as residents ""are experiencing chaos and uncertainty regarding temporary housing that is untenable.""
FEMA replied Jan. 19 — the Biden administration’s last full day — extending the temporary shelter program until May 26. 
A FEMA spokesperson told PolitiFact that as of Jan. 28, more than 2,600 families remain temporarily housed in hotels or motels. Of those, approximately 740 were notified the weekend of Jan. 18 that they had 21 days to find new housing because they no longer met the criteria for the temporary housing. 
The most common reason people lost eligibility was that an inspector had called three times and received no response, FEMA said. Some people were no longer eligible because they missed an inspection or had checked out of their hotels.
In Buncombe County, home to Asheville and one of the counties hardest hit by the hurricane, 407 households were no longer eligible for temporary housing as of Jan. 11 because FEMA had inspected their homes and deemed them safe to occupy, county spokesperson Lillian M. Govus said. An additional 143 households withdrew from the program and 49 households were homeless before the storm, making them ineligible. As of Jan. 28, 701 Buncombe households remain in the program.
In a Jan. 16 interview with Fox News, Sen. Ted Budd, R-N.C., called on FEMA for better communication with its recipients, saying he had heard from some who believed they were wrongly evicted.

Previous administrations, including Trump’s first administration, also had eligibility criteria for remaining in temporary housing.
During Trump’s first term, a Feb. 16, 2018, FEMA news release about Texas hurricane victims said ""criteria review"" would determine who no longer qualified.
""Any sheltering option is, by design, a temporary, short-term solution, designed to be a bridge to middle- and longer-term solutions,"" Brock Long, then the FEMA administrator, said at a March 2018 House Homeland Security Committee hearing.
North Carolina politicians said people were losing their temporary housing
PolitiFact North Carolina partner WRAL reported Jan. 15 that ""dozens"" of people had been removed from hotels despite FEMA’s extension. That information was based on social media posts by North Carolina’s Republican senators, Budd and Thom Tillis. 
Budd wrote Jan. 14 on X that his office was ""hearing from dozens in (West North Carolina) who have been kicked out of their hotels tonight"" despite the extension. In an X post, Tillis said dozens of people were ""told their hotel vouchers expired despite not having a safe and livable home to go back to.""
The same night, Budd wrote on X that his office had spoken with FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell and ""we are working through the list of those in need of lodging."" 
Our ruling
Trump said, ""The Biden administration kicked 2,000 displaced North Carolinians out of their temporary housing into freezing 20-degree weather,"" earlier in January. 
We received no information from FEMA that 2,000 people were removed in January. FEMA said on the weekend of Jan. 18, about 740 families were notified that they had three weeks to move out of the agency’s transitional sheltering assistance program because they no longer met eligibility criteria.
Trump omitted the context about why they were removed — because they no longer met eligibility requirements — and that the removals are standard procedure that also happened during other disasters during his first administration. 
FEMA reviews temporary housing participants’ eligibility every two weeks, and households whose homes are deemed habitable or who can’t be reached lose eligibility.

The bill became law Dec. 11 after the Republican-majority state legislature voted to override then-Gov. Roy Cooper’s veto. Cooper, a Democrat, had argued the bill strips money from Hurricane Helene victims, who were still rebuilding after the September storm ravaged western Western North Carolina. 
Before the Legislature voted to override Cooper’s veto, the governor told reporters on Dec. 3 that the bill ""took away the next governor's authority to continue enhanced unemployment payments from people who lost their job because of the storm."" 
""So, they actually took money out of western North Carolina,"" he said.
Cooper made similar claims on social media later that day.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
In an X post, Cooper said the bill ""hurts Western North Carolina by stripping away higher unemployment benefits for people who lost jobs from the storm."" The post also included a clip of Cooper speaking on MSNBC, saying Republicans ""actually took money away from western North Carolina.""
Does the bill really take money away from western North Carolina?
The law ends the governor’s ability to boost unemployment benefits amid a state emergency, something Cooper did after Helene. That could mean that North Carolinians won’t receive higher benefits in the future. But the law doesn’t include a provision that would withdraw any money that has already been allocated to people in the western part of the state. When Cooper made this statement, the bill had not yet become law, so his use of the past tense may have confused some North Carolinians.
It’s also worth noting that unemployment aid is far from the only way the state has been helping Helene victims. Beyond the immediate response that included hundreds of state and federal workers on the ground, the Republican-led state legislature has also approved more than $1 billion in Helene aid relief. That’s a fraction of the nearly $4 billion in aid Cooper called for while governor, though state lawmakers say they plan to do more in the future.
The power in question
Helene hit North Carolina on Sept. 27, bringing 30 inches of rain, causing more than 1,400 landslides. It was the deadliest and most damaging in state history. According to an estimate by the state’s budget director, Helene damaged about 74,000 western North Carolina homes — only about 5% of which were covered by flood insurance.
On Oct. 16, Cooper issued an executive order that raised the maximum weekly unemployment benefit from $350 per week to $600 per week and extended eligibility from 12 weeks to 26 weeks for Helene victims. Cooper cited powers granted to him under the state's Emergency Management Act when announcing the order. The increased amount was available to anyone seeking unemployment benefits in North Carolina — not just Helene victims.
Unemployment benefit payouts increased by more than 10,000 cases after Helene hit North Carolina, according to data provided by the state commerce department.
In August, 19,271 people received benefits. The number dipped to 17,981 in September, then shot up to 27,385 in October and rose to 31,547 by the end of the year.
Republican leaders don’t believe the Emergency Management Act authorizes the governor to boost unemployment benefits, so they included a section in Senate Bill 382 to ""correct a misapprehension of the powers conferred to the governor,"" the bill states. It also says the law ""does not allow for the governor to waive, modify, suspend, or fail to enforce or execute"" the laws related to employment security.
Cooper’s claim that Republicans ""took"" money out of western North Carolina could give the impression that money going to Helene victims, or that was scheduled to go to Helene victims, is being revoked. But that’s not so.
Delayed effect of the bill
The bill says the enhanced employment security benefits won’t end until March 1, when North Carolina’s state of emergency is scheduled to expire.
""This does not take money from Western North Carolina and does not impact a single dollar of unemployment benefits currently flowing to employees in that area,"" Lauren Horsch, a spokesperson for Republican Senate leader Phil Berger, told PolitiFact in a statement.

By Will Doran • March 7, 2016
Cooper’s office didn’t dispute that the bill leaves the current unemployment benefits untouched, but argued that Helene victims will likely still need the enhanced benefits after March 1, so withdrawing the governor’s ability to increase those payments will have significant consequences for people struggling to rebuild.
Gov. Josh Stein, also a Democrat, is expected to extend the state of emergency beyond March 1, Cooper’s office said last month, before Stein was sworn in. States of emergency for less-devastating hurricanes lasted longer than six months. For example, North Carolina was under a state of emergency for 15 months following 2018’s Hurricane Florence.
""Because Republican legislators are shortchanging western North Carolina recovery, especially the small business grants that are desperately needed to support the economy, residents out west will need enhanced unemployment benefits beyond next March,"" Cooper spokesperson Ben Conroy said.
""The Legislature's shameful decision to rip this power away from future governors only harms North Carolinians who need support to recover from this and future natural disasters,"" Conroy said.
Laura Brewer, a Stein spokesperson, told PolitiFact that the new governor hasn’t decided whether to extend the state of emergency, adding that there are many options ""to help them rebuild and recover, including support for those who have lost their jobs, homes, and businesses.""
Our ruling
Cooper said North Carolina Republicans ""took money out of western North Carolina"" when they passed a Hurricane Helene relief bill last month.
Legislators stripped the governor’s power to enhance unemployment benefits using the state’s Emergency Management Act. 
Cooper has a point in that if the state of emergency is extended without the bill in place, unemployed Helene victims could continue to receive enhanced benefits beyond March 1.
But the bill did not claw back or halt enhanced unemployment benefits that are scheduled to be available through March 1.

But the order’s definitions of ""male"" and ""female"" led some social media users to wonder whether Trump accidentally categorized all people as women:

""Under Trump's executive order, every single person in America is now legally classified as female,"" a Jan. 21 X post read. ""All embryos begin by developing female sex organs, with male sex organs only replacing them at around 6 weeks of gestation.""

But scientific research and conversations with legal experts showed this claim was off base.
Early fetal development is not as straightforward as the post described. But neither was the wording in Trump’s executive order. It said:
""(d)  ‘Female’ means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell.
""(e)  ‘Male’ means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the small reproductive cell.""
Conception is when a sperm successfully fertilizes an egg, forming a zygote. The single-cell zygote possesses genetic coding related to sex —  typically XX (female) or XY (male) — but it cannot produce its own reproductive cells. 
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
In the first few weeks, a growing embryo has growing gonads that haven’t developed into male or female reproductive structures yet. Around six weeks, genetic coding triggers the growing embryo to start developing testes or ovaries.
Although scientists once theorized that all embryos start developing as females, recent research has determined that neither sex is ""default."" 
Scientists who considered the order said they were perplexed by its juxtaposing ""at conception"" alongside an aspect of sex differentiation that happens only after weeks of gestation. But legal experts were also leery of claims that interpreted the definition to mean all people would be ""legally classified"" as female.
The problem with the executive order’s definition
A person’s ""sex,"" according to scientists, is not easily measured by one factor. Chromosomes, gonads, hormones and genitalia can all contribute to a person’s sex categorization.
And those determinants are not all clear at conception. Nor do they always add up to typical male or typical female anatomy. Research estimates that about 1.7% of the population, for example, has intersex conditions or differences in sex development — cases in which someone’s anatomy does not neatly fit into male or female. 
People born with Klinefelter Syndrome, for example, have XXY chromosomes and although they are typically assigned male at birth, their anatomy is often affected by the additional female chromosome. People with de la Chapelle syndrome have female chromosomes but can develop a penis and be assigned male at birth. People with androgen insensitivity syndrome have male chromosomes, but don’t respond to their body’s naturally produced male hormones. That means genetically a male fetus, with testes and normal testosterone production may develop a vagina and be assigned female at birth and raised as a girl. 
Other conditions result in ambiguous genitalia that do not fall neatly into either sex category.
People with these conditions, therefore, are not accounted for under Trump’s order.
""A lot of other variations might be noticeable at birth if they cause other types of genital differences,"" said Sylvan Fraser Anthony, legal and policy director at Interact, a nonprofit advocating for intersex youth. ""Others will be discovered, you know, not until later.""
Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy officer for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, said political efforts to place people ""into two neat categories does not reflect biological reality."" 
""There are thousands of Americans whose chromosomes, external genitalia, and reproductive capacity do not match with some politician’s notion of how the world should be,"" Tipton said.
The problem with the claim that Trump’s order classifies everyone as female
The assertion that ""all embryos begin by developing female sex organs"" is based on outdated science. 
Scientists in the past theorized that female fetal development was the default pathway, stopped only by the activation of a Y chromosome gene that causes testes to develop. 
But recent research suggests that neither path is ""default"" and the development of both testes and ovaries is complex. More recent research describes reproductive structures in the first few weeks as ""bipotential,"" meaning they are not yet male or female.
Legal scholars also challenged the claim’s notion that Trump’s order would legally affect ""every single person’s"" sex.

“Fani Willis has just confessed to collusion with J6 committee.”
By Sofia Ahmed • January 24, 2025
""There is no such thing as a universal ‘legal’ gender,"" Rose Saxe, the American Civil Liberties Union’s LGBT & HIV Project’s deputy director, said.
State and federal governments’ understanding about a person’s sex and gender essentially depends on however official paperwork — birth certificates, driver’s licenses, passports — describes the person.
And Trump’s new definition of the sexes applies only to interpretation and enforcement of federal law and policy, not state laws. That could mean that people may no longer be able to change their gender markers — the ""M"" or ""F"" denoting male or female — on federal documents such as passports. But state IDs are governed by state laws, which may enable people in some states to get IDs that align with their gender identity. 
How the  Trump administration will enforce the order’s definition is also unclear: When  federal employees submit paperwork for example, Saxe said, will they be asked, ""‘Did you belong at conception to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell?’ Maybe that's what they're going to ask people, or are they just going to have a form that says male or female and ask people to check the box?""

And despite the definition’s wording, Saxe said, a court would be unlikely to adopt the interpretation that the law ""classifies"" everyone as female. 
These definitions might be short-lived. Within 30 days, the order dictates, ""the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall provide to the U.S. Government, external partners, and the public clear guidance expanding on the sex-based definitions set forth in this order."" 
Federal effort to define sex follows similar state-led efforts, but with new language
State lawmakers have so far led the charge to define and redefine sex and gender, and Trump’s effort follows suit. Nine states have explicitly defined sex as binary according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit that tracks LGBTQ+ policy.
Like Trump’s order, nearly all states adopting laws to redefine sex and gender have added definitions that refer to reproductive aspects of sex, the ability to produce sperm and eggs, as the dividing line between the sexes rather than chromosomes or genitalia 
But Trump’s order language is distinct from the state laws in its use of the phrase ""belonging, at conception,"" a likely nod to anti-abortion rights advocates.
During a Jan. 24 March for Life event in Washington D.C., abortion rights opponents celebrated Trump’s inclusion of the phrase ""at conception."" 
""I don’t know if you saw (Trump’s) executive order but it defines life as beginning at conceptions rather than birth,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told the crowd.

An X post said, ""Under Trump's executive order, every single person in America is now legally classified as female.""

Experts PolitiFact interviewed called the executive order’s definitions of what defines a male and a female as scientifically flawed and legally awkward. But no one believed the order’s language would lead the federal government to classify everyone in the U.S. as female.

Trump ha firmado varias órdenes ejecutivas relacionadas a inmigración, pero ninguna habla de eliminar el derecho de aplicar a la residencia al casarse con un ciudadano estadounidense.
PolitiFact contactó a expertos en políticas migratorias para verificar la veracidad del video.
Gil Guerra, un experto en política migratoria en el Niskanen Center, un centro de estudios, nos dijo que el derecho a la residencia permanente basada en matrimonio esta protegido bajo la Ley de Inmigración y Nacionalidad, específicamente la Sección 201(b)(2)(A)(i). 
Guerra dijo que este derecho legal no puede eliminarse únicamente mediante una orden ejecutiva y requeriría una ley del Congreso para cambiar los hechos.
""Si bien la ciudadanía por nacimiento está directamente consagrada en la Enmienda 14, los derechos de inmigración basados en el matrimonio surgen de la ley estatutaria (la INA) y no de la Constitución misma"", dijo Guerra. ""Sin embargo, el derecho de los ciudadanos estadounidenses a casarse y vivir con sus cónyuges ha sido reconocido como un derecho fundamental por la Corte Suprema en casos como Loving v. Virginia (1967)"".
Él también dijo que aunque Trump tiene una discreción significativa en implementar la ley de inmigración, esta autoridad tiene límites claros y el presidente no puede anular unilateralmente derechos estatutarios claros otorgados por el Congreso.

This one will ask residents whether to amend the state constitution to include an existing law requiring a photo ID to vote. Enshrining it in the constitution would make it harder for the state Supreme Court to declare it unconstitutional, which Republicans fear because of the court’s current liberal majority. It would also be harder for Democrats to repeal it if they gain control of the Legislature in future years. 
The GOP maintains that the photo ID law has increased security at the ballot box. But experts and advocates say it’s making it more difficult for certain groups of people to vote, such as Black voters in Milwaukee. 
In a news release blasting the attempt to get the voter ID law in the constitution, the public advocacy group Common Cause Wisconsin expounded on that. 
""Wisconsin makes it more difficult for its citizens to vote than almost any state in the nation,"" the group wrote in the release. 
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
Is that accurate? 
Let’s take a look at the evidence. 
Wisconsin voter ID law is stricter than most
When asked to back up the claim, Common Cause Wisconsin Executive Director Jay Heck said he was pulling from the expertise of UW-Madison political science professor Barry Burden, who wrote previously for The Observatory that Wisconsin’s voter ID law is one of the strictest in the country. 
Burden repeated it in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, writing that ""Wisconsin demands more than nearly all of the other states"" when it comes to getting a ballot. 
The National Conference of State Legislatures lists Wisconsin as one of just nine states with ""strict"" photo ID laws used to identify voters. State Rep. Scott Krug, R-Nekoosa, even lauded that status in a Jan. 8 news conference, saying, ""We have one of the hardest ID systems that you can have."" 
In short, pretty much everyone agrees that Wisconsin’s voter ID law is severe. 
But there are other elements of the election process that can make it harder for people to vote — and Common Cause Wisconsin didn’t specify in the statement that the group was referring to voter ID alone. 
So, how does Wisconsin measure up when it comes to other ways to judge voting accessibility? 
Wisconsin ranks as one of the hardest places for voters  
Burden pointed to the Cost of Voting Index, run by Michael Pomante, a research fellow at Claremont Graduate University. The index accounts for 56 laws and policies that dictate the rules people must follow to get registered and cast a ballot, and weights them with a statistical analysis to determine whether they make it easier or harder to do so in a given state. 
Wisconsin has some election laws and policies that are more accessible compared with other states, Pomante said.
For example, voters can register at the polls the day they go to vote, they can register to vote online, they can cast an in-person absentee vote and they can drop their completed absentee ballots off in dropboxes, which were made legal again last July. 
But other restrictions drive our ""cost of voting"" up.

Besides the strict voter ID law, Wisconsin has stringent rules for voter registration drives, does not have automatic voter registration, does not have preregistration for young voters, does not allow all voters to join a permanent absentee ballot list, does not consider Election Day a public holiday and does require a witness’ signature on absentee ballots, Pomante said. 
The state’s ranking also drops because it doesn’t offer early voting, he said. On the index, that’s different from in-person absentee voting, which Wisconsin does have. True early voting functions similarly to voting on Election Day, with multiple sites and evening and weekend hours to cast a ballot, while in-person absentee voting can be more restricted, Pomante said. 
In Wisconsin, the in-person absentee voting experience varies from one municipality to the next, Burden said. Larger cities like Madison offer multiple sites and extended hours, while in smaller communities — much more plentiful around the state, he noted — ""in-person voting before Election Day is not really an option because municipal clerks do not provide it."" 
Not everyone differentiates between the two. The Movement Advancement Project’s Democracy Maps, for example, give Wisconsin credit for an ""adequate early voting period"" of more than seven days. Burden said a more nuanced consideration of the issue would need to investigate the exact hours, days and locations that early and absentee voting are offered in different states. 
Where does all this land Wisconsin on the index? In 2024, Wisconsin had the fifth-highest cost of voting of all 50 states. In other words, it’s the fifth-hardest state to vote in the country, behind New Hampshire, Texas, Arkansas and Mississippi, which was the hardest.  
In 1996 — the year the index goes back to — Wisconsin was ranked the fourth-most-accessible state in the nation for voters. That’s because at that time, the state was among very few that offered same-day voter registration, Pomante said. When other states started adopting it, Wisconsin’s ranking started to drop. 
The state’s most dramatic drop occurred between 2011 and 2015, when former Republican Gov. Scott Walker signed the voter ID requirement into law and it took effect despite a swarm of lawsuits seeking to knock it down. It has continued to fall ever since, figures from the index show. 
Our ruling 
Common Cause Wisconsin said the state makes it more difficult for people to vote than almost any other state in the nation. 
Our voter ID law alone is one of the most stringent in the country — and research shows the state’s other restrictive voting policies make it more challenging to vote compared to most other states.

Trump has vowed to renew his 2017 tax plan and enact new tax cuts, including eliminating the income tax on tips. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which cut income taxes for most Americans and gave the biggest cuts to higher earners, is set to expire in 2025. 
During the 2024 campaign, Trump floated eliminating the individual income tax entirely and replacing it with tariffs on foreign goods, though that was not part of his official campaign platform. Economists at the time said the idea was unrealistic because the value of imported goods is far lower than the U.S. tax base. 
Our ruling
A Facebook post said Trump signed an executive order that would transform the IRS into the External Revenue Service and paychecks ""will not be taxed which means no refunds for people."" 
Trump’s executive memo did not nix the IRS or income taxes; it directed Cabinet officials to consider the feasibility of establishing an External Revenue Service to collect tariffs. Congressional action would be required to create that agency, which would exist alongside the IRS.

Harris was born in October 1964 to an Indian mother and a Jamaican father. In her 2019 autobiography, ""The Truths We Hold: An American Journey,"" Harris recounted that her parents came to the U.S. to study at the University of California, Berkeley.

That post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)
The post is wrong about the scope of Trump’s executive action. The order said ""no department or agency of the United States government shall issue documents recognizing United States citizenship"" to people: 
""When that person’s mother was unlawfully present in the United States and the person’s father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth,"" or 
""When that person’s mother’s presence in the United States was lawful but temporary, and the person’s father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth."" 
Although the first category excludes only the children of people in the U.S. illegally, that second category requires that if the executive order takes effect, even the babies of people legally — but temporarily — in the U.S. will be denied citizenship. 
People can be in the U.S. lawfully but temporarily for multiple reasons, such as being in the country on student, work or tourist visas.
When analyzing the order, immigration experts — including advocates and reporters — repeatedly said it would deny citizenship to the children of some people who are in the U.S. legally. 
Gil Guerra, an immigration policy expert at the Niskanen Center, a think tank, said in an X post that Trump’s order ""notably would cover the children born to several types of *legal* immigrants."" 
He told PolitiFact that under the order, if neither parent is a legal permanent resident or naturalized citizen, then even a pair of legal immigrants could have children who don’t qualify for American citizenship. 
""If two immigrant parents here on H-1B visas have a child born in March of this year, that child will no longer be an American citizen,"" Guerra said, referring to a visa program that lets U.S. employers hire foreign workers with certain skill sets.
If a company legally brings employees and their families to the United States using another visa program known as L-1, any children born to those employees in the U.S. will no longer be U.S. citizens, he continued.  
""The children of people admitted through the refugee system, which is distinct from the asylum system, will similarly no longer be U.S. citizens if they are born while their parents are waiting to adjust their status,"" Guerra said.

Montoya-Galvez said the president had ordered ""federal agencies to deny birthright citizenship to children of parents who are unauthorized immigrants OR temporary visa holders.""

Trump on Jan. 20, his first day back in office, pardoned or commuted the sentences of more than 1,500 people convicted of crimes over the Capitol attack. Although some Republicans have criticized the sweeping clemency, we found no examples of Senate Republicans endorsing a Trump impeachment. 
Some Republicans bristled at the choice to pardon people who violently assaulted police officers. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said people who assaulted officers ""should do the time,"" Politico reported. 
Politico reported that Sens. Thom Thillis, R-N.C., Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, also expressed disappointment in Trump’s decision. Cassidy, Murkowski and Collins were among seven Republicans who voted in 2021 to convict Trump over his role in the Capitol uprising.
Newsweek reported on one organization’s push for another Trump impeachment, but we see no signs Republicans will support that.
The Democratic-led House impeached Trump twice during his first term: first after he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to investigate Joe Biden and his son, and again on a charge of inciting an insurrection at the Capitol. The Senate acquitted him both times. 
Other social media posts in the days since Trump’s inauguration have made unsubstantiated claims of a growing impeachment movement. X posts claiming that Reps. Alexandria Ocaso-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Jamie Raskin, D-Md., filed articles of impeachment against Trump emerged Jan. 24. But the pair did no such thing. 
We found no examples of federal officeholders from either party saying Trump’s pardons were grounds for impeachment. With Republicans controlling the House, it’s almost certain an impeachment effort would fail in the chamber.
Twenty Republican senators would need to side with all Democrats to convict Trump on impeachment charges. All but six of the 43 senators who voted against convicting Trump in 2021 are still in office, and three of the seven Republicans who voted to convict him are in office. If history is any indication, there is no support in the conference to convict Trump.

"Donald Trump
stated on January 22, 2025 in an interview:","The U.S. House Select Committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol “deleted and destroyed all of the information that they collected over two years.”","stated on January 22, 2025 in an interview:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/jan/24/donald-trump/donald-trump-goes-too-far-in-claim-that-jan-6-comm/,,"In his first Oval Office TV interview since his second-term inauguration, President Donald Trump repeated a claim he’s said for months: that the U.S. House Select Committee that investigated him for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol attack deleted ""all"" evidence.

""What they did was criminal, that’s why they got pardoned,"" Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity Jan. 22, referring to former President Joe Biden’s preemptive presidential pardons for committee members such as former Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., and U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss. ""They deleted and destroyed all of the information that they collected over two years."" 
Trump continued: ""And you know why? Because it proved I was right. All of that information was deleted and destroyed. They deleted all of the information having to do with the 10,000 soldiers that I offered to Nancy Pelosi, and she's now on tape admitting it."" (That’s a distortion of what Pelosi said.)
Trump made a similar statement shortly after his Jan. 20 swearing in, saying in a postinaugural speech that the U.S. House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the U.S. Capitol, ""destroyed all evidence, they deleted everything, there’s virtually nothing left."" In the Oval Office later that day, he again claimed committee members ""destroyed all of the documents, they deleted all of the information, there’s no information.""
Republicans and Democrats have long argued over the committee's records and whether certain information should have been archived. But there’s no basis for Trump’s claim that ""all"" of the evidence was deleted and destroyed.

Committee members — seven Democrats and two Republicans — said some videos and sensitive material were not included in the archive to protect witnesses, but that everything else was properly saved, including more than 100 testimony transcripts, depositions and documents that remain publicly available online.

Trump’s statements about Jan. 6, 2021, are back in the news because the day he took office he pardoned nearly all of the people convicted for their actions in the attack and commuted the sentences of 14 others.

On Jan. 22, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., announced a new select subcommittee chaired by Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., ""to continue our efforts to uncover the full truth"" about Jan. 6.

A Trump spokesperson declined to comment. In a 2023 court filing, Trump’s lawyers argued that some committee evidence was missing, but they didn’t say ""all"" evidence was destroyed.
Trump’s statements about evidence being destroyed are part of his and his allies’ long-standing, two-pronged response to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack: They downplay what happened that day while arguing that the committee covered up its investigation into the day’s events.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
How claims about evidence destruction first surfaced
The Jan. 6 select committee concluded its work in December 2022 with an 845-page final report. It detailed Trump’s effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election, the catalyst for the Capitol attack. The committee voted unanimously to recommend charges against Trump to the Justice Department.

Much of the committee’s work is available online. During its 18-month investigation, the group held 10 public hearings, interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses and collected more than 1 million documents. It released more than 100 transcripts of testimony, plus memos and emails, and videos, depositions and documents that are still publicly available online.

Pages of the executive summary from the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, are photographed Dec. 19, 2022, in Washington. (AP)

In June 2023, Loudermilk wrote to Thompson, the committee's chair, saying that some of the committee’s materials were not archived, namely video recordings of the interviews that had written transcripts.

Thompson’s July 2023 reply said more than 1 million records had been archived in coordination with the National Archives and Records Administration and the Committee on House Administration.

The committee sent some information deemed private and sensitive to the White House and Department of Homeland Security for archiving, Thompson wrote, to ensure that no information was released improperly. The committee dissolved before a full review of the materials was complete.
  The material sent to the executive branch, Thompson wrote, contained ""law enforcement sensitive operational details and private, personal information that, if released, could endanger the safety of witnesses.""
  As for videos not being included, Thompson said the committee followed House rules by providing transcripts of the interviews. House Rule VII outlines the requirements for preserving House records at the end of each two-year term.
  What was in a subsequent House Republican report?
House Republicans in early 2023 opened their own investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, deeming the select committee’s work ""incomplete.""
In March 2024, the House Administation’s Subcommittee on Oversight, led by Loudermilk, released its first findings report, which accused the Jan. 6 committee of deleting records and promoting a political narrative against Trump instead of investigating the Capitol’s security failures.
The report included newly released testimony and said the Jan. 6 committee ""failed to archive and subsequently provide the subcommittee any of its video recordings of witness interviews, as many as 900 interview summaries or transcripts, more than one terabyte of digital data, and over 100 deleted or encrypted documents.""
The files were deleted days before Republicans took over the House majority in January 2023, the report said.
House Republicans said they intended to release a final report Jan. 6, 2025. No such report had been made public as of Jan. 24. PolitiFact contacted Loudermilk’s office to ask about the report’s status, but did not hear back by publication.
Just as he did in his comments to Hannity, Trump regularly references what he says was deleted or ""destroyed"" evidence involving ""10,000 soldiers."" But in March we looked into this claim and rated it False.
That’s because it involved an interview that was initially withheld from the public record while the Department of Homeland Security reviewed it for security concerns. The testimony said Trump floated the number of ""10,000"" National Guard troops but it didn’t substantiate Trump’s claim that he had ordered any deployment.
Trump lawyers sought subpoenas for some committee records
The Jan. 6 committee records discussion arose in the federal government’s prosecution of Trump for election subversion preceding the attack; the case was dropped after Trump won the 2024 election.

Records from the case show that Trump’s lawyers sought what they considered to be ""missing records,"" filing an Oct. 11, 2023, motion that cited Loudermilk’s June 2023 letter that had said some of the committee’s materials, namely videos, were not archived. The motion did not go as far as Trump’s recent statement that  ""all"" records from the entire investigation were destroyed. Instead, it said certain records weren’t archived or transferred to the Committee on House Administration, such as video recordings of transcribed interviews, depositions and intelligence information.
The Trump motion said he wanted ""to determine if these records have been lost, destroyed, or altered.""
Smith wrote in a response that the government had already provided Trump with select committee records and that those his motion identified were a ""small number of transcripts"" of interviews conducted subject to confidentiality agreements.

The video from Trump’s Truth social account showed Willis testifying during a Feb. 15, 2024, court hearing that would determine whether she should remain on Georgia's election interference case against Trump.

Her role in the prosecution came under scrutiny because of her romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, a special prosecutor Willis had hired and who had withdrawn from the election interference case. In the full nearly 14-minute video posted on Trump’s account, Willis didn’t admit to colluding with the Jan. 6 committee.

The claim appears to originate from Judicial Watch, a conservative group that sued Willis for not disclosing correspondence she may have had with the Jan. 6 committee or then-U.S. special counsel Jack Smith. Smith led federal investigations into Trump’s handling of classified documents and attempts to hold onto power after the 2020 elections. Smith resigned from the Justice Department in January before Trump’s second presidential inauguration.
Judicial Watch released a video Dec. 11 titled, ""Fani Willis confesses!"" In the video, Tom Fitton, Judicial Watch’s president, said Willis confessed to having communication records with the Jan. 6 committee, which he said ""confirms she was in collusion"" with it.

Among the flurry of executive orders Trump signed Jan. 20, one order revoked dozens of Biden’s past executive orders and memos, including one aimed at lowering prescription drug prices. 
The change reversed Biden’s direction to the Health and Human Services Department to develop pilot plans to reduce Medicare and Medicaid prescription drug costs. Those plans had not taken effect before Trump took office, but revoking the executive order did not immediately shut them down. 
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
It did not reverse the cost savings Biden signed into law in the Inflation Reduction Act, which allowed Medicare to negotiate the price of drugs, capped insulin costs for Medicare recipients at $35 a month and capped out-of-pocket drug costs for Medicare recipients. 
Since Congress passed those changes, only an act of Congress can undo them. 
Trump’s orders ""simply say that the current president doesn't agree with the past one's political statements issued as executive orders,"" said Joseph Antos, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. ""If anyone wants to change the law, Congress has to pass a new law making that change.""
The prices that Medicare negotiated for the first 10 drugs under the Inflation Reduction Act will take effect in 2026. The Biden administration announced the next set of drugs that Medicare will negotiate for on Jan. 17, which will take effect in 2027. That timeline will not be affected by the removal of Biden’s executive order.  
The executive order, which Biden signed in October 2022, had not spurred any lower drug prices by the time Trump revoked it Jan. 20. 
The order directed the Health and Human Services Department secretary to consider ""new health care payment and delivery models"" for the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to test. 
The department settled on three plans: 
A voluntary program for Medicare Part D providers to offer copayments of less than $2 a month for a list of common generic drugs.
A program to improve access to cell and gene therapies for Medicaid recipients.
A plan to speed up approval of new drugs.
With the executive order revoked, it’s unclear what will become of those proposals.
Trump’s Health and Human Services Department could build on them or develop similar policies aimed at lowering drug prices, but his administration has not announced any steps to do so.

Biden canceled and delayed implementation of the Trump administration's rules aimed at drug prices. 
Revoking Biden’s order did not raise drug prices for anyone, since the plans had not taken effect yet. But it does mean, if Trump’s administration cancels those programs, their potential drug price reductions won’t be realized, said Mariana Socal, a Johns Hopkins University professor who specializes in drug prices. The gene therapy plan may have also improved access to therapies that Medicaid patients can’t now receive. 
""Patients will not see their savings that they could see under these programs, but they also might not see an extension in access that could be happening under these programs,"" she said.
Our ruling
A Facebook post said Trump ""reversed all the cost caps Biden negotiated for anyone on Medicare or Medicaid."" 
Trump revoked an executive order calling for the Health and Human Services Department to develop plans to lower prescription drug prices, and Trump’s administration is unlikely to continue pursuing those plans.
The change does not reverse any policy that lowered drug prices, but it signaled the administration may not advance existing pilot projects that aimed to do so. 
The cap on insulin and out-of-pocket drug costs and negotiated drug prices for Medicare recipients, which Biden championed and signed into law in the Inflation Reduction Act, won’t be affected by Trump’s decision to revoke Biden’s order.

PolitiFact searched Musk’s X account and found no such post. We contacted Musk, but did not hear back before publication. We also found no credible news reports about Musk making these remarks.
During his Jan. 20 speech at Washington, D.C.’s Capital One Arena, Musk thanked the crowd for electing President Donald Trump.
As he offered thanks, Musk put his right hand to his heart, then extended his hand to the crowd with his palm at a 45-degree angle. He turned around and repeated the gesture.
""Thank you for making it happen,"" Musk said. ""Thank you. My heart goes out to you. It is thanks to you that the future of civilization is assured.""
Online commentators compared Musk’s gesture with the Nazi salute under Adolf Hitler. Others compared it with the ""Roman salute,"" also known as the ""fascist salute,"" which Italian fascists and later Nazi Germany adopted. Rolling Stone wrote that white nationalists and neo-Nazis celebrated Musk’s gesture.
Other social media users, though, said the gesture was meant to show Musk symbolically throwing his heart to the crowd, as he said ""my heart goes out to you"" immediately after the gesture.
The Anti-Defamation League posted on X that ""this is a delicate moment"" and ""it seems (Musk) made an awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute, but again, we appreciate that people are on edge.""

The mountain was called Mount McKinley from 1917 to 2015, when the Obama administration renamed it Denali.
The Obama-era change followed decades of requests from Native Alaskan leaders for the mountain’s native name ‘Denali,’ a Koyukon Athabaskan word meaning ""the tall one,"" ""the high one"" or ""the great one"" to be restored.
In his Jan. 20 order, Trump called the name change to Denali an ""affront to President McKinley’s life, his achievements, and his sacrifice."" The national park where the mountain is found will continue to be called Denali National Park and Preserve, Trump’s order said.
Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, for years has argued to keep the name Denali and criticized Trump’s move.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
""I strongly disagree with the President’s decision on Denali,"" Murkowski said in a Jan. 20 X post. ""Our nation’s tallest mountain, which has been called Denali for thousands of years, must continue to be known by the rightful name bestowed by Alaska’s Koyukon Athabascans, who have stewarded the land since time immemorial.""
Is Murkowski right that the mountain has been called Denali for ""thousands of years""? PolitiFact asked four Native Alaskan language and cultural experts and a former cartographer involved in the 2015 name change to weigh in.
""It is not just thousands of years, but over 10,000 years,"" said James Kari, a linguist and an emeritus professor at the Native Alaskan Language Center who has specialized in the Dené or Athabaskan language family for 50 years. Native Alaskan place names have been in use for more than 13,000 years, Kari said.
There is little written evidence of place names related to Native Alaskan tribes because they primarily have an oral tradition. But experts agree the name ""Denali"" has been passed down over several generations.
""We have this overlap of history and archaeology and geology that align with validating the longevity of Dené place names,"" said Taa’ąįį Ch’igiiontà, the Gwich'in language director of the Neetsaii Gwich'in tribe, citing other Native Alaskan place names that have endured for centuries. The Gwich'in language is part of the Athabascan language family. ""So, I think it's quite accurate for Murkowski to say that the name is thousands of years old.""
A 2016 National Park Service article said, ""‘McKinley’ was incompatible with the Athabascan worldview because they rarely name places after people.""
We asked Murkowski’s office for further information but received no reply. Trump’s order said the interior secretary shall reinstate the name Mount McKinley; the Senate has yet to confirm Trump’s interior secretary nominee, former North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.
Disputes over the mountain’s name are not new
In 1975, Alaska’s Legislature passed a resolution requesting the mountain’s name to revert to Denali and Gov. Jay Hammond petitioned the federal government with this request. But the Ohio congressional delegation (where McKinley had been governor) blocked attempts to change the name.

After McKinley’s assassination in 1901, ""there was just an outcry of grief, of course, (and) that they thought: ‘We need to remember this man, let's rename that mountain in Alaska, make it McKinley’ and it stayed that way,"" said Douglas L. Vandegraft, the Domestic Names Committee’s former chairman and retired cartographer for the Interior Department. 
Despite that, Native Alaskans continued to refer to the mountain as Denali. 
For Indigenous people, the government’s use of native names for places is important after centuries of colonization that sought to erase native culture and identity.
""It feels to some people like a small thing, but for Indigenous people, it's really important because it's a matter of recognizing that we are here, that we were stewards of these lands in many cases for millennia,"" Forest S. Haven, assistant professor of anthropology and Alaska Native Studies at the University of Alaska Southeast, said. ""Returning these place names points to that. It brings indigenous people into the present and puts us on the land in a way that we historically always were.""

Murkowski said, ""Our nation’s tallest mountain … has been called Denali for thousands of years."" 
Four Native Alaskan scholars and a retired Interior Department official who researched the history of the name agree that Denali was the name of the mountain for thousands of years.

The April 1 ballot will include a referendum question asking if the voter ID requirement should be enshrined in the state constitution. 
At a Jan. 8 news conference announcing the referendum, Republicans argued the majority of the public — including in Wisconsin — supports requiring voters to show their ID before getting a ballot.
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said the referendum will allow voters an ""opportunity to give us their final say on something that is supported, if you look at any poll, by 70 to 80% of the public.""
If the referendum fails, Wisconsin’s voter ID law would still remain in place. If passed, it would elevate the law to the state constitution, making it harder for the state Supreme Court to overturn it or future lawmakers to repeal it.
""The left has chosen one of the most extreme liberals to run for the state Supreme Court,"" Vos added, referring to Susan Crawford, who as an attorney represented plaintiffs challenging the voter ID law.

""When 80% of the public in Wisconsin is in favor of an idea, I don’t know who would be afraid of that, except the person who’s with the 20% and is on the ballot,"" he said.
So, Republicans are also saying this level of support exists in Wisconsin, not just nationwide. Let’s look at the most recent polling available. 
Nationwide surveys from 2024 found support even above 80%
When PolitiFact Wisconsin contacted Vos’ office, his chief of staff, Jenny Toftness, pointed us to two polls, including a nationwide one Gallup released in October 2024.
That poll found 84% of the public supports requiring voters to provide photo identification at their polling place, with 15% opposed. 
That support breaks down into 98% of Republicans who favor voter ID, compared to 84% of independents and 67% of Democrats, Gallup found.
The poll randomly sampled more than 1,000 adults living in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, according to its methodology section. 
PolitiFact Wisconsin also looked at a similar poll conducted by the Pew Research Center, which state Rep. Scott Krug, R-Nekoosa, cited at the news conference. That poll was released in February 2024. 
That poll showed 81% support requiring government-issued photo identification to vote, with 18% opposed. That includes 95% of Republicans and 69% of Democrats.
Marquette last polled Wisconsinites on voter ID in 2021, found 74% support
Vos’ office also referenced the Marquette University Law School poll, considered one of the nations highest-quality polls.
Marquette asked the following question across multiple polls in 2012, 2014 and 2021: ""Do you favor or oppose requiring a government-issued photo ID to vote?""
In a poll of Wisconsin registered voters released Aug. 11, 2021, 74% favored voter ID, and 21% opposed it. Five percent didn’t know, and 1% refused to answer.

When broken down by party, support was at 92% among Republicans, 71% among independents and 55% among Democrats.
Interestingly, 74% is a higher measure of support than when the Marquette poll asked the same question multiple times in 2012 and 2014. 
Support hovered around 60% for most of that period, dropping as low as 58% in a October 2014 poll, and reaching as high as 66% in January 2012, the first time the question was asked.
Former Gov. Scott Walker signed the voter ID law in 2011, but it didn’t take effect until the 2016 presidential election cycle because of court challenges.
Although that data is more than 3 years old, Republicans are still referencing the most up-to-date polling in Wisconsin, because Marquette hasn’t asked the question since 2021.
Our ruling
Vos said ""70 to 80% of the public"" in Wisconsin and the country supports requiring photo identification to vote. 
National polling from Pew and Gallup released in 2024 shows more than 80% of the public supports voter ID, including majorities of Democrats.
The Marquette poll last asked about voter ID in 2021 and found support was at 74%, a jump from 2012 and 2014.

"Joe Biden
stated on January 17, 2025 in a statement:",“The Equal Rights Amendment has become part of our Constitution.”,"stated on January 17, 2025 in a statement:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/jan/22/joe-biden/bidens-false-claim-that-the-equal-rights-amendment/,,"Days before leaving office, former President Joe Biden said that 38 states had ratified the Equal Rights Amendment, an anti-sex-discrimination law Congress passed in 1972 — enough to make it the U.S. Constitution’s 28th Amendment.
Biden said he believes the amendment is in effect after Virginia became the 38th state to ratify it in 2020. Biden said he agreed with opinions by the American Bar Association and ""leading legal constitutional scholars that the Equal Rights Amendment has become part of our Constitution."" The deadline for states to ratify the amendment passed nearly four decades before Virginia ratified it. 
""I affirm what I believe and what three-fourths of the states have ratified: the 28th Amendment is the law of the land, guaranteeing all Americans equal rights and protections under the law regardless of their sex,"" Biden said in a written statement. 
Biden’s claim rests on legal interpretations that a ratification deadline Congress imposed when proposing the amendment is unconstitutional. Proponents of the Equal Rights Amendment have pushed for its recognition on these grounds, but other legal scholars consider the argument flawed.
No court in the country has recognized the amendment’s legitimacy, and the national archivist hasn't published it, despite efforts from activist groups to have the amendment recognized.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
When Congress passed the Equal Rights Amendment, which guaranteed protection against sex-based discrimination, the resolution set a seven-year time limit for three-fourths of the states to ratify the amendment and make it part of the Constitution. In 1979, Congress voted to extend the deadline by three years, to 1982. 
Not enough states ratified the amendment by 1982, but, in the intervening years, more states ratified the amendment despite the time limit on the original proposal. Five states withdrew their ratifications in the 1970s, and North Dakota did so in 2021. The debate over the amendment centers on the ratification deadline’s validity and the states’ withdrawals. 
Biden’s assessment is largely symbolic. His own Office of Legal Counsel in 2022 mostly supported an opinion from President Donald Trump’s first administration that said the amendment died when the 1982 deadline passed without the necessary support from three-fourths of the states. 
During his first term, Trump asked courts to block the amendment’s adoption.
National Archivist Colleen Shogan, a Biden appointee who oversees the National Archives and Records Administration and directs publishing constitutional amendments, said in December that the Equal Rights Amendment cannot be certified ""due to established legal, judicial, and procedural decisions.""
In a Jan. 20 statement to PolitiFact, a National Archives and Records Administration spokesperson said the amendment’s ""underlying legal and procedural issues have not changed.""
Biden did not direct the national archivist to publish the amendment. Biden’s White House press team did not respond to a request for comment. 
Amendment supporters say deadline is unenforceable
Some legal experts say the amendment became part of the Constitution when Virginia ratified it in 2020, arguing the time limit and state rescissions are not constitutionally valid. 
Harvard University law professor Laurence Tribe, who focuses on constitutional law and civil rights, told PolitiFact he was one of the scholars Biden spoke to before issuing his statement. Tribe said the Constitution’s Article V, which lays out the amendment process, doesn’t authorize Congress to set time limits on ratification outside the amendment’s text. 
Congress has periodically set time limits for ratification in the amendment’s text, as it did with the 18th Amendment on prohibition. In other cases, Congress has proposed time limits in resolutions proposing amendments, rather than in the amendment itself.
Tribe also said the states that rescinded their ratification — Nebraska, Tennessee, Idaho, Kentucky, South Dakota and North Dakota — lacked legal grounds to do so, given a dispute over the ratification of the 14th Amendment. After the Civil War, some states tried to rescind their ratification of the 14th Amendment, which guaranteed equal protection under the law for formerly enslaved people. Congress denied those efforts and declared the amendment enacted after enough states had ratified it.
A federal court in Idaho ruled in 1982 that states could rescind their ratifications for the Equal Rights Amendment. The Supreme Court did not decide on the question because it dismissed the case after the ratification deadline had passed. 
The American Bar Association approved a resolution in August aligning with Biden’s opinion and arguing that the limitations on the ratification process are invalid.
Opponents say Congress can set time limits
Courts have generally not backed Biden’s view of the amendment’s validity.

By Claire Cranford • February 19, 2025
The U.S. Supreme Court has not ruled on the question directly, but a lower court judge said in 2021 that the existing precedent supports the argument that the time limit is legally enforceable.
The Supreme Court declined to hear the 1982 case that sought to prevent some states from rescinding their ratification of the amendment, declaring the issue moot after the ratification deadline had passed. The court’s decision to dismiss the case meant it believed the deadline had legal force, experts have argued.  
States and activists brought separate court cases around the time Virginia ratified the amendment, hoping to compel the then-National Archivist David Ferriero to certify the amendment as ratified. Both were denied because the groups lacked standing.
Accounting for the Supreme Court’s refusal to consider a case after the deadline had passed, along with other legal history, District Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled that the amendment’s deadline was valid in a 2021 opinion.
""It makes no difference if a ratification deadline is in the prefatory text of a resolution proposing an amendment or in the amendment itself — either way, the deadline is valid,"" he wrote. 
Stephen Sachs, a constitutional law professor and jurisprudence expert, said the amending resolution’s text has equal force as the amendment itself. 
""The resolution is the amendment: it’s agreed on by two-thirds of each House, and it specifies the precise changes to the Constitution that Congress wants to make,"" Sachs said. Even though Article V doesn’t expressly say Congress can impose deadlines, Sachs said it has the power to ""propose Amendments,"" which includes proposals that come with conditions.  
Given the judicial history on the issue, Sachs said Biden’s claim about the Equal Rights Amendment was ""wildly overconfident and irresponsible."" 
Our ruling
Biden said, ""The Equal Rights Amendment has become part of our Constitution."" 
The National Archives lists only 27 amendments to the Constitution. Courts have routinely dismissed the argument that it was properly ratified. 
Some legal scholars argue that the amendment was properly ratified, but for Biden to definitively say it’s ""the law of the land"" ignores precedent and the reality that no federal government entity has recognized the amendment as part of the Constitution.

But the day before his inauguration, he said things that made some people question his election victory anew.
Multiple social media users claimed that Trump admitted to rigging the 2024 election, citing two of his remarks during his Jan. 19 preinauguration rally in Washington. One of Trump’s statements involved Elon Musk, a billionaire who owns X and is Tesla’s CEO.
""Trump just admitted LIVE that the election was rigged and THAT is why he is President,"" one Jan. 19 Threads post read. The post shared video of Trump in which he said:

Parsing Trump’s words shows he didn’t admit to rigging the 2024 election. PolitiFact contacted the Trump team but did not hear back.

Listening closely to the Trump’s quote about the Olympics, it appeared he was talking about the 2020 election. He was saying that if he had won the 2020 election, he couldn’t have served for a third term, and therefore wouldn’t be president during the 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Olympics. But because he didn’t win the 2020 election, he could serve his second term from 2025 to 2029, a period including  both events.
Trump has long maintained the Pants on Fire claim that the 2020 election was fraudulent. And he repeated that stance during his Inauguration Day ceremonies.

But as PolitiFact has previously reported, that election’s outcome was verified over and over again. States and Congress certified the results. Trump and his allies lost more than 60 lawsuits. A group of conservatives who examined fraud and miscount claims by Trump and his allies concluded that they ""failed to present evidence of fraud or inaccurate results significant enough to invalidate the results.""
And Trump’s preinauguration comments about Musk referred to Musk’s significant efforts to campaign for Trump in Pennsylvania. Musk joined Trump onstage at an October rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, when Trump returned to the site where an assassin had targeted him in July. Musk also founded America PAC, a political action committee that ran canvassing operations in battleground states. And he opened a Pittsburgh campaign base dedicated to electing Trump.

""So we are abundantly clear it has nothing to do with climate change or Donald Trump,"" Trump Jr. wrote in a Jan. 14 Instagram post, which included a clip from the business and tech podcast ""All-In.""
PolitiFact asked Trump Jr., President Donald Trump’s eldest child, for evidence behind his claim. We reached out through his website and contacted the Trump Organization, for which Trump Jr. is executive vice president. We received no reply. 
Climate scientists PolitiFact spoke to disagreed with Trump Jr. and said climate change contributed to the Los Angeles fires’ size and destructiveness. Numerous studies have linked human-caused climate change to the western U.S.’ worsening wildfires.
In a Jan. 13 analysis, scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles attributed about 25% of the brush dryness around Los Angeles to human-caused climate change. Increased heat over the summer and fall dried out the brush that fueled the fire, the report said.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
The fires would likely have been destructive even without climate change’s influence, the report said, but would have been ""somewhat smaller and less intense.""
Fully understanding what contributed to the fires — and how much climate change worsened them — will take more research, the report said. Nevertheless, the report identified factors in which ""human-induced climate change is very likely to play a role in the wildfires.""
Climate change has contributed to more intense wildfires in the western U.S. in recent decades, primarily through higher temperatures, which suck more moisture out of vegetation and make it easier to burn, said University of California, Los Angeles climate scientist Chad Thackeray, who contributed to the new report. Fires have not become more frequent, Thackeray said, but they have become larger and burned more acres.
A 2021 study the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration commissioned found that 68% to 88% of the increase in vapor pressure deficit (a measure of the air’s dryness) from 1979 to 2020 linked to human-caused warming, rather than natural atmospheric changes.
A 2016 study, funded partly by Columbia University and NASA, found human-caused climate change ""has emerged as a driver of increased forest fire activity and should continue to do so while fuels are not limiting.""
High temperatures over the past summer and fall dried out the brush surrounding Los Angeles and were the main contribution climate change made to the current fires, Thackeray said. 
""This occurs because a warmer atmosphere is ‘thirstier’ meaning it has a greater demand to evaporate water from vegetation/soil,"" he said. 
Average temperatures in California — and around the globe — have increased steadily since 1900, an effect linked to carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. 
""While dry weather is not unprecedented in the US West, 2024 was exceptionally dry in Southern California and through model experiments and statistical analysis, it’s demonstrable that part of that dryness can be attributed to climate change,"" University of California, Davis climate modeling professor Paul Ullrich said in an email.

By Ciara O'Rourke • January 27, 2025
Some of the growth in wildfires in recent decades can also be attributed to forest management practices, he said, but climate change plays a major role.
Another possible climate change-related contributor to the fire is heavy rainfall during previous rainy seasons. The rain spurred vegetation growth, and the vegetation dried out during dry months, giving the fire more fuel. UCLA’s study estimated climate change may have contributed around 10% of the excess rainfall from 2023 to 2024. 
In contrast to previous wet years, Southern California received virtually no rain during the current wet season, which began in October. Although models predict that climate change will delay the rainy season’s onset, Thackeray said research continues and there isn’t enough evidence to attribute the lack of rain in the last few months to climate change. 
""The observed decline may be simply a regression to the mean after an extended period of unusually wet falls in the mid-1900s,"" the UCLA report said.
The strong Santa Ana winds that worsened the fires in their initial days were stronger than usual for this time of year, but not unprecedented and not attributable to climate change, the report said.
During his Jan. 15 Senate confirmation hearing, Chris Wright, President Trump’s nominee to lead the Energy Department, faced questions about his 2023 description of climate-related wildfire warnings as ""hype to justify more impoverishment from bad government policies."" Wright said he stood by his comment, but he acknowledged the scientific consensus on climate change.
Our ruling
Trump Jr. said the Los Angeles wildfires have ""nothing to do with climate change."" 
There is ample evidence that higher temperatures have made California wildfires bigger and more destructive in recent decades. For these fires in particular, a preliminary report found that high temperatures, worsened by climate change, made the vegetation in Southern California dryer, contributing to the fires.

But these posts misconstrue the scope of Trump’s executive order on birthright citizenship, which already faces legal challenges.
Birthright citizenship refers to people’s right to become U.S citizens if they’re born in the U.S., regardless of their parents’ immigration status.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
Trump’s executive order says the privilege of U.S. citizenship ""does not automatically extend"" to children born in the U.S. when the mother was ""unlawfully present in the United States and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person's birth"" or when the ""mother’s presence in the United States at the time of said person’s birth was lawful but temporary.""
It lists temporary statuses such as visiting the country on a visa waiver program or visiting on a student, work or tourist visa.
The order says it will apply in 30 days to children born under those circumstances.
Usha Vance was born in the U.S. after her parents immigrated from India in the late 1970s. Her father, Krish Chilukuri, is an engineering lecturer at San Diego State University. Her mother, Lakshmi Chilukuri, is a molecular biology teaching professor and provost of Sixth College at University of California, San Diego. 
We don’t know what their immigration statuses were when Usha was born in 1986, but Trump’s executive order won’t revoke Vance’s citizenship status. That’s because the order applies to future children born in the U.S. to parents in the country illegally. It doesn’t say that this directive will be applied retroactively.
The order says, ""Nothing in this order shall be construed to affect the entitlement of other individuals, including children of lawful permanent residents, to obtain documentation of their United States citizenship.""
Trump’s directive says agencies cannot issue documents recognizing citizenship or accept any governmental documents purporting to recognize citizenship for births in those cases. He told department leaders to issue public guidance within 30 days for the order's application.
The order faces legal challenges. On Jan. 20, immigrant and civil rights groups filed the first lawsuits against the order, just hours after Trump signed it.

Hours after taking the oath, Trump sat in the Oval Office to sign a bevy of executive orders. As he fielded questions from the press, he noted one reason behind his desire to end the nation’s long-standing citizenship policy.

""Birthright, that’s a big one,"" Trump said, taking the binder. ""It’s ridiculous. We are the only country in the world that does this with the birthright, as you know, and it’s just absolutely ridiculous.""
Birthright citizenship refers to the right of people born in the U.S. to become citizens, regardless of their parents' immigration status. Trump’s order, which seeks to end the practice for children whose parents are in the country illegally or temporarily, is expected to prompt a long court fight — it will not undo birthright citizenship on its own.

But is Trump right that the U.S. is the ""only"" country in the world to offer automatic citizenship to anyone born on their soil?
No. PolitiFact contacted Trump’s team for comment but did not hear back by publication.
There are about three dozen countries that have unrestricted birthright citizenship, also known as ""jus soli,"" or ""right of the soil."" The U.S. is joined by neighbors Canada and Mexico, along with nearly every country in Central and South America.

But the countries’ makeup and locations are notable.

The U.S. and Canada are considered the only two ""developed"" countries, as defined by the International Monetary Fund. And a closer look at the list shows countries that offer birthright citizenship are almost exclusively in the Western Hemisphere. No country in Europe or East Asia, for example, has a similar policy.
Some experts say colonialism offers one explanation. As European countries colonized the Americas, they were eager to populate their settlements and many created lenient naturalization laws and policies to do so.

The U.S. has maintained its birthright laws despite experiencing high levels of immigration.

Some European nations, meanwhile, have chosen to modify their citizenship requirements over the years. Ireland ditched its birthright citizenship law in 2005, and France jettisoned its own in 1993.

But other nations maintain a version of birthright citizenship. In Germany and the United Kingdom, for example, citizenship is automatically granted to people born within the nations’ borders, provided at least one parent is a citizen or permanent resident.
Trump’s birthright citizenship executive order
Trump’s Jan. 20 order says that the privilege of U.S. citizenship ""does not automatically extend"" to children born in the U.S. when the mother was ""unlawfully present in the United States and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth"" or when the ""mother’s presence in the United States at the time of said person’s birth was lawful but temporary."" It lists temporary statuses such as visiting the country on the visa waiver program or visiting on a student, work or tourist visa.

The order will apply to people born on or after Feb. 19 to children born under those circumstances and directs agencies against issuing documents recognizing citizenship and bars them from accepting any governmental documents purporting to recognize citizenship for births in those cases.

But the 14th Amendment says that ""all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside."" A 1952 statute echoes the amendment’s language, reading in part: ""The following shall be nationals and citizens of the United States at birth: (a) a person born in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.""
Universal birthright citizenship’s opponents see wiggle room in the qualifier ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof,"" which appears in both places.
Legal scholars have traditionally interpreted the phrase to exclude only the U.S.-born children of foreign diplomats or of enemy forces engaged in hostilities on U.S. soil. But people skeptical of birthright citizenship’s legal basis have argued that the U.S. Supreme Court has never specifically ruled on whether the children of people in the country illegally would qualify for birthright citizenship.

Legal experts have told us that attempts to end birthright citizenship would prompt a court battle over the long-standing interpretation of the 14th Amendment’s wording and could require a constitutional amendment.
Within a day of Trump’s issuing the order, that process is already playing out. Eighteen U.S. states and the American Civil Liberties Union have sued the Trump administration to block the order.
Our ruling
Trump said that the U.S. is the only country in the world to have unrestricted birthright citizenship.
This is incorrect. Around three dozen other countries offer automatic citizenship to children born within their borders, regardless of their parents’ immigration status.

We rate this False.

By Ciara O'Rourke • January 28, 2025
Legal and government ethics experts told PolitiFact that if Trump had decided to personally buy TikTok, it likely would not have violated federal law. That’s because the president is exempt from federal conflict of interest laws that require other government officials to divest from financial interests.
""The idea at the time, some 50 years ago, was that the president does so many things that any asset could be considered a conflict,"" said Jordan Libowitz, vice president of communications at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a government ethics watchdog nonprofit.
Although not required to do so, presidents have typically divested from financial interests or put them into a blind trust before assuming office, said Jessica Tillipman, associate dean for government procurement law studies at George Washington University.
But Trump broke that status quo. During his first term, Trump raised government ethics concerns because he didn’t divest from his hotels and golf clubs. Since then, his business ventures have grown to include the social media platform Truth Social, cryptocurrency and new real estate projects abroad — presenting more opportunities for conflicts of interest.
""We’re used to presidents going out of their way to separate themselves from their assets so that the American people never doubted whose interest they were acting in, but that was always done because it was the right thing to do, not because it was legally required,"" Libowitz said.
On Jan. 17, the Supreme Court upheld the federal law requiring TikTok’s Chinese parent company ByteDance to sell the social media app or face a ban of the app in the U.S. starting Jan. 19, one day before Trump’s inauguration.

"Dana Loesch
stated on January 6, 2025 in an X post:",Buncombe County “is still demanding property taxes on homes destroyed by Hurricane Helene based on pre-Helene assessments that no longer apply.”,"stated on January 6, 2025 in an X post:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/jan/17/dana-loesch/are-north-carolinas-helene-victims-still-required/,,"Some social media users are angry that North Carolina property owners must still pay full taxes on properties that were damaged after Hurricane Helene.
The September storm was the deadliest and most damaging in state history. It brought 30 inches of rain, caused more than 1,400 landslides, and damaged about 74,000 homes in western North Carolina — where only about 5% of victims have flood insurance, according to an estimate by the state’s budget director.
In a Jan. 6 X post, Buncombe County reminded residents to pay their 2024 property taxes before they become delinquent — prompting outrage from some users of the platform.
""This county is still demanding property taxes on homes destroyed by Hurricane Helene based on pre-Helene assessments that no longer apply,"" Dana Loesch, a conservative radio show host, told her 1 million X followers in a post.
Other X users posted similar responses, suggesting that Buncombe should waive or reduce property taxes for people affected by Helene.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
A viewer emailed WRAL-TV, PolitiFact’s North Carolina partner, asking if it’s true that Buncombe County and other counties in North Carolina are collecting taxes on Helene-damaged properties. 
The county is indeed collecting taxes. But Loesch’s focus on Buncombe makes it seem as though the county is doing something out of line. In fact, Buncombe — and other North Carolina counties that are collecting taxes — are acting in accordance with state law. Although receiving a hefty tax bill may feel like a bitter pill following the disaster of losing one’s property, the reality of the state’s taxation system gives counties little flexibility. 
Properties are taxed based on what their assessed values were as of Jan. 1 of that year. Buncombe County properties were last assessed in 2021 and those values are still in place. That means the damages from Helene aren’t reflected in the most recent tax bills. And they won’t be reflected until updated assessments are applied. 
Loesch and others on social media implied that Buncombe County should waive or change a property owners’ bill for 2024. State law prevents counties from doing that, so Buncombe officials can’t give Helene victims a break on their 2024 property tax bill — even if they wanted to. There’s an appeals process, but the deadline for that ended before Helene hit. 
Buncombe County officials are encouraging property owners to tell the county about damage to their properties, so that it can be reflected in the next assessment. 
What property owners are being taxed on
  Loesch wrote that properties are being taxed on assessments that ""no longer apply."" The property’s value as of Jan. 1 still applies to a property owner’s 2024 tax bill — even if it doesn’t reflect the current market value, or what someone might be willing to pay by the end of the year.
Loesch didn’t respond to our questions about her statement.
Here’s how the taxing process works:
Counties assess the values of the properties within their borders. The assessments take into account recent comparable sales and other market factors into consideration.
Property taxes are based on the assessed property value that is in place on Jan. 1 of that year, as well as the county’s tax rate.
Most tax bills don’t go out until late summer, after the county’s property tax rate is set, and property owners have about three months to pay their tax bills.
The bills are considered delinquent and can accrue interest if not paid before Jan. 6 (which is why Buncombe posted reminders on social media that day).
Because properties are taxed based on their assessed value as of Jan. 1, damage from Helene doesn’t factor into the 2024 tax bill.
Dia Harris, a North Carolina Department of Revenue spokesperson, told PolitiFact that the agency regularly fields questions from property owners about how disasters might affect their tax bill.
""A property owner whose residence is lost to fire during the calendar year will still be responsible for payment of taxes that are due on the property for that year,"" Harris said. ""And the bill must be based on the full value of the property’s condition as of Jan. 1 of that year.""
Why are taxes based on a property’s value as of Jan. 1, as opposed to another date?
The Jan. 1 date is set by state law and provides county governments with some insight into the size of their tax base, which is helpful for county leaders as they set the next fiscal year spending plan, said Chris McLaughlin, a professor of public law and government at UNC-Chapel Hill who posted about the issue in a Oct. 11 blog entry. If values go down after an assessment, for instance, county leaders might consider raising the tax rate to make up for lost revenue. 
State legislators ""chose Jan. 1 presumably because it is well in advance of the start of the fiscal year (July 1) for which taxes will be levied,"" McLaughlin told PolitiFact in an email. ""This provides the local government with some certainty about the size of its tax base (although there will be minor changes due to appeals) so it can accurately budget and decide upon a property tax rate before the fiscal year begins.""

Counties can’t offer property tax exemptions
  Some social media posts suggested that Buncombe County should waive or postpone property tax bills. However, state law prohibits counties from doing that. The law reads:
""The governing body of a taxing unit is prohibited from releasing, refunding, or compromising all or any portion of the taxes levied against any property within its jurisdiction except as expressly provided in this subchapter."" 
Unless state legislators change the law, ""local governments may not waive property taxes as a response to a natural disaster,"" McLaughlin said. If Helene victims want immediate property tax relief, he said ""they should talk to their local representatives and tell them to pass a bill.""
In the meantime, Buncombe is offering assistance in other ways. The county offers payment plans to property owners who want to avoid paying their tax bill in one lump sum. The county also offers financial assistance to low-income households in areas where increasing property value outpaces income.
In advance of the 2025 tax bill, Buncombe officials are asking residents to inform them of any damage sustained to their properties. The county’s website features a banner: ""Please report damage to your home or property caused by Hurricane Helene."" Clicking the banner opens a form that Buncombe residents can fill out online and submit to the county.
""Property that is damaged as of Jan. 1, 2025, will see a reduction in 2025’s taxable value,"" said Kassi Day, a Buncombe County spokesperson. ""Our assessment team has been working hard to survey damaged areas so values can be updated to reflect the current situation.""
Buncombe officials are also taking action that could limit the effect of property taxes in 2025.
The county was scheduled to conduct a revaluation in 2025 — taking into account how market values have risen over the last four years. Buncombe’s Board of Commissioners recently voted to delay the county’s reappraisal of properties, allowing the 2025 values to remain based on 2021 market assessments.
Our ruling
Loesch said Buncombe County ""is still demanding property taxes on homes destroyed by Hurricane Helene based on pre-Helene assessments that no longer apply.""
Buncombe and other counties are collecting taxes on properties even if they were damaged by Helene. But it’s inaccurate to suggest that the damage from Helene is relevant to the 2024 tax bill, which in North Carolina is based on a property’s assessed value as of Jan. 1, 2024 — months before Helene made landfall. 
Properties that lost value because of damage from Helene could see that reflected on their tax bill due in 2025, Buncombe officials said. Loesch and others on social media implied that Buncombe County should waive or change a property owners’ bill for 2024. Generally speaking, state law prevents counties from doing that.
Loesch’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details that might influence someone’s understanding of the situation. We rate it Half True.",,,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/asheville1007/44be331a7ac0f1afd698a9c488f889c1.jpeg,Related

""Some of these reservoirs have been dry for 15, 20 years,"" Vance said on Fox News Sunday as he spoke about Gov. Gavin Newsom. ""The fire hydrants are being reported as going dry while the firefighters are trying to put out these fires. There is a serious lack of competent governance in California, and I think it’s part of the reason why these fires have gotten so bad.""
During the height of fighting the Palisades fire on Jan. 7 and Jan. 8, water demand outpaced the amount of water flowing to hydrants, and some hydrants went dry. A nearby city reservoir was empty for repairs when the fire broke out, the Los Angeles Times reported Jan. 10. 
But Vance’s description of decades-long dry reservoirs is misleading. Experts on California’s water management told us they were not aware of any major reservoir that has been dry for 15 years or more. The state-managed reservoirs in Southern California are, in general, at or above their historic average storage for January. 
The Santa Ynez reservoir that supplies drinking water to Los Angeles’ local system has been empty since February 2024 because it needed repairs. The reservoir can hold up to 117 million gallons. But it’s managed by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, not the state, and it’s used primarily for drinking water.

Had the reservoir been full, it may have supplied more water pressure to the Pacific Palisades during the height of the firefighting and slowed the rate at which hydrants ran dry, said Steve Margulis, the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering chair at the University of California, Los Angeles.
But that reservoir hasn’t been closed for 15 years, so it’s unclear which reservoirs Vance was referring to.
California has close to 1,500 surface reservoirs, a 2018 Public Policy Institute of California Water Policy Center report said. Most are small and managed by local governments, said Jay Lund, the vice director of the Center for Watershed Sciences and a civil and environmental engineering professor at the University of California, Davis. 
Some reservoirs are intentionally left at low levels or empty, Lund said, because they’re used for flood control. But those reservoirs fill during heavy rainfall to prevent flooding. 
It’s possible that a local reservoir somewhere in the state has been shut down for several years, but we did not find an example, and President-elect Donald Trump and Vance’s transition team did not provide examples when PolitiFact reached out for comment. 
""I am sure there are very small reservoirs that have been empty for some time, for one reason or another,"" said Thomas Harter, a hydrology professor at the University of California, Davis. ""No major reservoirs have been empty for that long.""
Small reservoirs that serve local areas outside of Los Angeles have no relation to the city’s water system.
Los Angeles’ water comes from local aqueducts, groundwater and water purchased from Southern California’s Metropolitan Water District. The water district’s water is supplied by the Colorado River, groundwater and the State Water Project that moves water from the north to the dryer southern end.
State Water Project Deputy Director John Yarbrough said in a statement to PolitiFact that there are ""no dry reservoirs in the State Water Project system."" Most of the major reservoirs tracked by the California Department of Water Resources are at or above their historic average storage. 
In a Jan. 12 interview with NBC News, Newsom rebutted Trump’s criticisms of Northern California water management and described Southern California’s reservoirs as ""completely full."" Although the nearby state reservoirs aren’t completely full, they’re close. The state-managed reservoirs in Southern California have stores above 75% of their total capacity.
Newsom’s critics accused the governor of misleading by not mentioning the local empty Santa Ynez reservoir. After the interviewer noted the empty local reservoir, Newsom said, correctly, that the reservoir is not related to the state and federal water management system that Trump criticized early in the wildfire response.

“An ICE minivan was reportedly set on fire in Philadelphia.”
By Sofia Ahmed • February 19, 2025
Newsom on Jan. 10 called for an investigation into why the Santa Ynez reservoir was empty when the Palisades fire broke out. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power said in a Jan. 11 press release it will conduct an investigation into water resiliency and how to better respond to climate-related disasters. 
Regardless of the amount of water in the pipes, though, hydrants and local water infrastructure are built for routine structure fires, not large wildfires that consume entire neighborhoods. The water may have slowed the fire in some places, but experts said it likely would not have dramatically contained the fire. 
Margulis told us it’s unclear how much that extra water would have helped, and the reservoir’s absence should be part of a post-fire investigation. 
""Any additional reservoir would have helped maintain supply and pressure in the area that draws water from it for a longer period of time, but to what extent remains to be determined,"" he said. ""However, given the conditions, once the fire was ignited and started to spread quickly, it is unlikely that the extra supply would have made a major difference in containing it.""
The Department of Water and Power in February 2024 shut down the Santa Ynez reservoir because of damage to its cover. The reservoir supplies drinking water to the city, so it’s subject to environmental regulations to prevent contamination. 
The department said the repairs are ""subject to the city charter’s competitive bidding process which requires time."" The Los Angeles Times reported a $130,000 contract was issued to a Lakeside firm to repair the cover.
Upcoming investigations may determine that local government or management shortcomings contributed to a delay in repairing the reservoir. But the reservoir was shut down for less than a year, not 15 years or more. And it’s not indicative of a statewide problem with reservoirs.
Our ruling
Vance said that some reservoirs in California ""have been dry for 15, 20 years."" 
Experts said that statewide, there are no major reservoirs that have been dry for more than 15 years, and most of California’s reservoirs are above their historic average storage.

One reservoir that supplies water to the Pacific Palisades area has been shut down for nearly a year, and that may have eased the water pressure shortage during the height of the firefighting.

This claim has no factual basis. The wildfires have destroyed thousands of homes in greater Los Angeles, belonging to both celebrities and noncelebrities.
State and local officials have said the Los Angeles wildfires’ cause remains under investigation and could take weeks or months to determine. High winds and dryness in Southern California have fueled the fires’ spread.
A Washington Post investigation found that the initial fire in the Palisades neighborhood erupted Jan. 7 around where a New Year’s Eve fire had been extinguished six days earlier, raising what some experts said was a possible reignition of smoldering material from the previous fire. 
PolitiFact fact-checked and rated False a claim that Combs’ Los Angeles home was ""completely consumed"" by the fires. Combs’ home still stood as of Jan. 16; the house was not in an evacuation zone nor was it considered immediately threatened.

Federal agents already raided Combs’ Los Angeles and Miami homes in March, according to a federal indictment, seizing evidence that included narcotics, guns, ammunition and ""more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil and lubricant.""
Combs was arrested in September 2024 on charges he led a racketeering conspiracy and used abuse, threats and coercion to engage in sex trafficking and other crimes. Combs has pleaded not guilty and is being held in a Brooklyn, New York, jail awaiting trial.
The original video clip of Carter warning about fires has been taken down, but other social media posts resharing the video show that it predated the Los Angeles wildfires outbreak.
Experts have previously told PolitiFact that conspiracy theories related to breaking news often surge when there are information vacuums.

These claims conflated two distinct forms of federal assistance — both of which were offered to support people in both states’ disaster-stricken communities — to inaccurately assert that the assistance offered to California was more comprehensive than what North Carolinians received. 
No two disasters are exactly the same and it’s too soon to say exactly how much money will be spent in either place. But the federal response to the California wildfires has so far mimicked the government’s response to Hurricane Helene hitting North Carolina. 
On its ""Hurricane Helene: Rumor Response"" page, FEMA said it hadn’t shifted resources away from North Carolina to respond to the wildfires, as some people had claimed. 
""FEMA has enough funding to support recovery efforts in multiple areas, including communities affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton as well as response efforts in California,"" the agency wrote. ""The supplemental funding bill approved by Congress on December 20, 2024 included $29 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund. FEMA is supporting over 100 major disasters and will continue to support the recovery in these communities for as long as it takes."" 
Federal cost share for disaster response was increased to 100% in both places. 
In late September 2024, Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida. The storm then advanced north, causing devastating flooding in western North Carolina on Sept. 27. The next day, Biden approved a disaster declaration for North Carolina.
The Palisades fire in Los Angeles began as a brushfire Jan. 7. Biden approved a disaster declaration for California Jan. 8. 
The disaster declarations made federal funding available to the hurricane and wildfire victims in each state. 
""Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster,"" the White House statements said. 
Both statements said federal funding was available to state, tribal and eligible local governments ""on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work"" in affected counties in both states. ""Finally, Federal funding is available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures statewide,"" the statements said.  
In both instances, Biden later increased the percentage of costs the federal government would take on for emergency work: 
""The President authorized the federal cost-share to be increased from 75% to 100% for the first 180 days of the incident period,"" the Federal Emergency Management Agency said Oct. 2 about Hurricane Helene’s destruction in North Carolina. 
""The President authorized the federal cost-share to be increased from 75% to 100% for a period of 180 days of the state’s choosing within the first 270 days of the incident period,"" FEMA said of the California wildfires Jan. 14.

“JD Vance is in North Carolina, and he’s found furnished apartments to put the people in that have been living in tents.”
By Madison Czopek • January 30, 2025
Emergency payments: North Carolinians qualified for $750. Californians qualify for $770. 
On Jan. 13, Biden encouraged wildfire victims to apply for one-time $770 payments for emergency supplies. 
That $770 payment Biden mentioned is the same assistance as the one-time $750 payment made available to 2024 hurricane victims — the difference being a $20 annual cost-of-living increase, Federal Emergency Management Agency spokesperson Jayce Genco said.
These one-time payments come from FEMA’s Serious Needs Assistance program, which covers the cost of immediate emergency supplies such as water, food, first aid, baby formula diapers and personal hygiene items, Genco said. If people had to evacuate and stayed in hotels, the money could go toward those costs or toward the cost of fuel needed to evacuate, he told PolitiFact on Jan. 14. 
The one-time payments are initial payments provided to people as they await other assistance they might qualify for, according to FEMA’s website. In California and North Carolina, victims of the natural disasters who receive these initial payments might qualify for additional aid. 
Our ruling
A Facebook post said that after the damaging Los Angeles wildfires, ""California gets 100% aid for the next 180 days while Western North Carolina got $750.""
The posts conflated two kinds of federal assistance while saying North Carolina hurricane victims received only $750 in federal aid. That’s inaccurate — those one-time Serious Needs Assistance payments in North Carolina were initial aid people could use for emergency supplies as they awaited other assistance. California wildfire victims can apply for those payments, too. 
In both instances, Biden declared disasters and later increased the percentage of costs the federal government would absorb for emergency work to 100%. 
The federal response to the California wildfires has so far mimicked the government’s response to Hurricane Helene hitting North Carolina.

Trump’s 2020 words and actions showed support for TikTok ban
In July 2020, Trump began signaling his intention to ban TikTok — partly as retaliation for the COVID-19 pandemic, which he blamed on China, where TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, is based. His campaign released political ads on Facebook and Instagram accusing TikTok of ""spying"" on users.
""Do you think we should ban TikTok? Sign the petition NOW!"" one ad, which has since been deleted, said.
At that time, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Trump administration officials were ""looking at"" a TikTok ban.
Trump was asked about a potential ban following Pompeo’s remarks.
""It’s something we’re looking at, yes,"" Trump said in an interview with Gray Television, Bloomberg News reported. ""It’s a big business. Look, what happened with China with this virus, what they’ve done to this country and to the entire world is disgraceful.""
On Aug. 6, 2020, Trump signed Executive Order 13942, which sought to ban TikTok, citing national security concerns.
""At this time, action must be taken to address the threat posed by one mobile application in particular, TikTok ... The United States must take aggressive action against the owners of TikTok to protect our national security,"" Trump wrote in the order.
Trump argued that TikTok’s data collection practices threatened ""to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans’ personal and proprietary information,"" which could be used for blackmail and corporate espionage.
The order sought to apply its TikTok ban within 45 days unless ByteDance agreed to sell the app to a U.S. company. American companies including Microsoft Corp., Oracle Corp. and Walmart lined up to make an offer that would have sold off TikTok’s business in the U.S. and some other countries.
But two federal courts struck down Trump’s order in October 2020. A month later, Trump lost the presidential election.

Trump told Fox News he didn’t know about Yass’ link to the company when they met and said they didn’t talk about TikTok.
In a June 2, 2024, statement, a day after joining TikTok, Trump said he created the account ""to use every tool available to speak directly with the American people about how Joe Biden's failed presidency is tearing apart our beautiful nation and how I am going to stop him."" 
After winning the election, Trump continued to speak favorably about the app. Asked at a Dec. 16, 2024, press conference about whether he’ll try to stop the TikTok ban, Trump said, ""I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok."" 
On Dec. 27, 2024, Trump filed a brief with the Supreme Court, asking justices to stay the ban’s Jan. 19 effective date to let his administration negotiate a resolution.
""President Trump opposes banning TikTok in the United States at this juncture, and seeks the ability to resolve the issues at hand through political means once he takes office,"" the brief stated.
The New York Times reported Jan. 15 that the Trump Vance Inaugural Committee invited TikTok CEO Shou Chew to the inauguration, along with other prominent tech executives, including Zuckerberg. 
Our ruling
In July 2020, Trump said, ""As far as TikTok is concerned, we’re banning them from the United States."" The next month, he signed an executive order that sought to ban the app; courts struck it down.
During the 2024 campaign, Trump spoke often against a ban. In a December filing with the Supreme Court, Trump said he ""opposes banning TikTok in the United States at this juncture.""
Trump has completely changed his position on a TikTok ban. That meets our definition of a Full Flop.

Maudro se juramentó sin mostrar pruebas de que ganó las elecciones del 28 de julio 2024 contra el candidato de la oposición Edmundo González. González presentó actas electorales mostrándolo como el ganador de las elecciones venezolanas. Sin embargo, el Consejo Nacional Electoral de Venezuela, sin que se publicarán detalles de las actas electorales, proclamó a Maduro como presidente.
La posesión de Maduro ha sido criticada y sancionada por varios países, incluyendo Canadá, Reino Unido y Estados Unidos. 
En un comunicado del 10 de enero, el Departamento del Tesoro de Estados Unidos describe sanciones que la administración del Presidente Joe Biden impuso a funcionarios ""que permiten la represión por parte de Nicolás Maduro y la subversión de la democracia en Venezuela"".
Este también menciona que el Departamento de Estado ofrece hasta $25 millones por información que conduzca al arresto y/o condena de Maduro y de Diosdado Cabello, ministro de Interior, Justicia y Paz en Venezuela (hasta $25 millones por cada uno). El Departamento de Estado también impuso una recompensa de $15 millones por información que lleve al arresto del ministro de Defensa Vladimir Padrino.
Pero este comunicado no amenaza a Venezuela con una intervención militar, ni tampoco habla de una preparación militar para derrocar a Maduro.

Un portavoz dijo que Estados Unidos reafirma su apoyo a los venezolanos a aspirar por un cambio democratico y pacīfico y que elogian el valor de los venezolanos y su compromiso a la democracia en medio de la represión. 
El Secretario de Estado de Estados Unidos, Anthony Blinken dijo el 10 de enero en X: ""La gente venezolana y el mundo saben que Nicolas Maduro claramente perdió las elecciones presidenciales de 2024 y no tiene derecho a asumir la presidencia hoy. Nos mantenemos listos para apoyar un regreso a la democracia en Venezuela"". 
Pero Blinken tampoco ha dicho en sus redes sociales o en comunicados sobre una preparación militar para entrar a Venezuela.

El 10 de enero, Mayorkas anunció la extensión del Estatus de Protección Temporal para Venezuela por 18 meses, la cual permite a venezolanos mantenerse en EEUU. La extensión es debido a una crisis bajo Maduro que ha llevado a altos niveles de crimen y violencia, impactando el acceso a alimentos, medicinas y otras necesidades básicas, según un comunicado del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional.
González también se reunió con Biden el 6 de enero donde Biden lo llamó presidente electo de Venezuela. En esta reunión discutieron planes para restaurar la democracia, según un comunicado de la Casa Blanca, pero Biden no dijo que Estados Unidos se está preparando para entrar a Venezuela. 
El presidente electo Donald Trump también publicó el 9 de enero en Truth Social su apoyo hacia la líder de la oposición Maria Corina Machado y reconoció a González como presidente electo de Venezuela. Trump también dijo que ellos ""no debían ser heridos y que debían mantenerse a salvo y vivos"".
Él publicó eso después que Machado volvió a la luz pública el 9 de enero luego de meses de estar resguardada para una protesta pacífica de los venezolanos en donde reivindicaron la victoria de la oposición en 2024. Machado fue interceptada por fuerzas de seguridad armadas al salir de la protesta y luego liberada, según ella contó en un video.

The video clips shared on Instagram showed a portion of Biden’s Jan. 13 remarks about the California wildfires. In his full remarks, Biden mentioned additional aid the federal government has extended to California, including a commitment to fully pay firefighting disaster response costs for about six months. Biden said that money would cover costs such as firefighter overtime pay, debris removal and temporary shelters for victims. 
Biden said he’d sent equipment including helicopters, tanker planes and fire engines to Los Angeles and had activated 500 U.S. Marines to help with search and rescue, airlife support and food and water distribution. 
Then, he mentioned the $770 payments. 
""We’re not waiting until those fires are over to be — to start helping the victims. We’re getting them help right now,"" Biden said.

“FEMA has been directed back to North Carolina with $2 billion in emergency funds: ‘We transferred it from the programs that fund welfare for illegals. They don’t be needing it.’”
By Ciara O'Rourke • January 24, 2025
Federal Emergency Management Agency spokesperson Jayce Genco said the one-time $770 payment would come from FEMA’s Serious Needs Assistance program. It aims to cover the cost of immediate emergency supplies such as water, food, first aid, baby formula diapers and personal hygiene items. If people had to evacuate and stayed in hotels, it could go toward those costs or toward the cost of fuel needed to evacuate, he said. 
The $770 payment is the same as the one-time $750 payment that was available to 2024 hurricane victims — with a $20 annual cost-of-living increase, Genco said.
As of Jan. 13, almost 6,000 survivors had applied for the $770 payments and more than $5 million had been sent out, Biden said. 
It is inaccurate to characterize the $770 payment as the only aid available. Biden declared a major disaster, meaning that fire victims can get different types of federal individual assistance alongside the Serious Needs Assistance. 
""This is one of many programs that FEMA has to help people,"" Genco said. ""Folks could be eligible for temporary housing. They could be eligible for repairs on their home. They could be eligible for some of the hazard mitigation assistance programs that we have."" 
FEMA’s Individuals and Households Program supports disaster victims and can provide money for things such as temporary housing during disaster-related displacement and funds to repair or replace primary residences that were damaged, according to the agency’s website. The program can also provide money for future hazard mitigation. For people with wildfire-damaged homes, that might include the costs of covering attic and crawlspace vents or installing noncombustible gutters and leaf guards, FEMA said. 
People can apply for federal disaster assistance by visiting www.disasterassistance.gov or calling 1-800-621-3362.
We rate the claim that the Biden administration is providing only ""$770 for people who lost everything"" in the Los Angeles wildfires False.

Although the Jan. 12 Instagram post’s photos appear to be contemporary, the image in the Jan. 10 Facebook post is from at least 2018, when social media users raised questions of directed energy weapons in connection with wildfires. 
Directed energy weapons are real. They use energy fired at lightspeed — high-energy lasers and high-powered microwave weapons that use concentrated electromagnetic energy — and countries including the United States have researched their use. 
We recently fact-checked claims that directed energy weapons started the fires in California. That’s False, experts told PolitiFact. 
And in 2023, we fact-checked and rated False claims that it was suspicious wildfires in Hawaii had burned cars while trees remained standing.  
But it’s not suspicious — or unusual. Lee Frelich, director of the University of Minnesota Center for Forest Ecology, said there’s no reason to think anything but wildfires caused the destruction in the Los Angeles area. And trees can survive wildfires for several reasons, Frelich said. Among them: They have high water content, they experience radiant heat only from nearby flames, they have thick bark protecting them from flames or they’re in a fortuitous location.

""Trees surrounded by paved areas are less likely to burn,"" Frelich wrote to PolitiFact in an email. ""Trees in the middle of lawns that are mowed to a short height often survive — in such cases, even if flames pass under the tree, the flames are very short and do not have enough energy to jump into the crowns of trees, and do not produce enough heat to girdle the base of the trunk, or to scorch the foliage via hot air rising up through the canopy.""
Plus, Frelich said, gusty winds — such as the ones we’ve seen in California — can ""lead to idiosyncratic effects like undamaged trees or houses in the middle of a severely burned area.""
Michael Gollner, who leads the Berkeley Fire Research Lab at the University of California, Berkeley, said fire can ""leapfrog"" through a community as embers land on houses and burn while landscaping is spared.
The resulting images can be dramatic, but they’re not evidence of directed energy weapons, Gollner said. It’s just fire spreading through ""urban fuels."" 
""You don’t need special technology to cause a devastating fire with incredibly dry fuels and extremely high winds,"" Gollner said.

"Tony Evers
stated on December 28, 2024 in X, formerly Twitter:","“After 30 years of Wisconsin’s checking account running a deficit, we've ended every fiscal year I've been governor with a positive balance. Today, we have a $4.5 billion positive balance, and a record-high balance in our state savings account.""","stated on December 28, 2024 in X, formerly Twitter:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/jan/15/tony-evers/does-wisconsin-have-record-high-budget-balances-un/,,"State budget season is approaching in Wisconsin, which means you’re bound to start hearing words like ""surplus"" and ""rainy day fund.""
Lawmakers craft a new spending plan every two years. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and Republicans who control the Legislature often disagree on whether to spend the state’s extra funds on programs, or give it back as tax cuts. 
Evers touted the state’s current financial standing Dec. 28, 2024, in an X post.
""After 30 years of Wisconsin's checking account running a deficit, we've ended every fiscal year I've been governor with a positive balance,"" he said. 
""Today, we have a $4.5 billion positive balance, and a record-high balance in our state savings account,"" Evers added. 
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
Wisconsin’s ""checking account"" refers to the general fund and its ""savings account"" is called the ""rainy day"" fund. We’ll refer to both in this fact-check.
The general fund is where the state’s tax collections go, including income taxes, sales taxes and corporate taxes. 
The ""rainy day"" fund is home to excess tax revenue. It’s reserved in case the state takes in less revenue one year or spends more than expected. That’s helpful in a mild economic downturn, for example.
With budget season approaching, let’s examine whether each part of Evers’ claim is correct. Along the way, we’ll try our best to explain the state government’s complicated financial accounts. 
Did Wisconsin’s general fund end with a positive balance each year under Evers?
PolitiFact Wisconsin contacted the governor’s office, and Communications Director Britt Cudaback directed us to several sources, including the state’s Annual Comprehensive Financial Report.
Here’s where things get confusing. The report is based on fiscal years, which run from the beginning of July to the end of June in Wisconsin.
Cudaback said the claim treats 2020 as the first fiscal year under Evers’ leadership. Although Evers introduced his first budget in 2019, he took office halfway through that fiscal year. 
The 2017-19 budget former Republican Gov. Scott Walker signed was still in place then, Cudaback said. So, we’ll start at fiscal year 2020.
Now, let’s see whether the general fund had a positive balance at the end of fiscal years 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024. 
The 2020 report showed a general fund balance of $1.5 million at the end of the year. 
In the next years, the balance reached the billions: $1.2 billion in 2021, $4.6 billion in 2022, $6.7 billion in 2023 and $4.5 billion in 2024.
So, the first part of Evers’ claim is correct. There was a positive balance — or a ""surplus"" — in the state’s general fund for each fiscal year he’s been in office.
Did Wisconsin’s general fund have a deficit for 30 years before Evers?
Let’s look at part two of Evers’ claim: Did the general fund have a negative balance, or ""deficit,"" for 30 years before he became governor?
For this piece, Cudaback pointed to a 2021 report from the nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy Forum. The report found the general fund had a surplus for the first time since 1990. That’s 30 years since Evers took office.
""For the first time on record, Wisconsin’s main fund closed the year with a small positive balance, wiping out the longstanding financial gap that was often referred to as a ‘deficit,’"" the report says.
That was partly because of federal pandemic aid flowing into Wisconsin. The surplus fell this year because that money dried up, and the general fund is now spending more than it’s taking in, a December forum report said.
Those 30 years included both Democratic and Republican administrations. But Evers is still correct that the general fund ran a negative balance for three decades before he became governor.
Does the state have a record-high balance in its ""rainy day"" fund?
The Legislative Fiscal Bureau has a chart that shows the balance of the ""rainy day"" fund between 2003-04 and 2021-22. It shows Wisconsin’s ""savings account"" did reach its highest balance in 2022, at $1.7 billion.
The December Wisconsin Policy Forum report provides more recent numbers and projections: $1.8 billion in 2023, $1.9 billion in 2024 and $2 billion in 2025.
Jason Stein, president of the Wisconsin Policy Forum, confirmed to PolitiFact Wisconsin that those are state records even if adjusted for inflation.

Rhode Island spends less than 10 percent of what the average state spends promoting tourism.
By C. Eugene Emery Jr. • December 12, 2010
So, yes, Wisconsin’s ""rainy day"" fund is growing and currently sits at a record balance.
Does Evers deserve credit for these positive balances?
Finally, one last piece.  Although Evers doesn’t directly take credit for the state’s financial health in his tweet, it’s certainly implied. 
Cudaback provided several examples of Evers’ actions, like using extra revenue to pay off state debt in 2019 and transferring general fund money to the state’s capital budget in 2023 to prevent new borrowing. 
But the full picture is more complicated. Republicans have also taken credit for the surplus, pointing out their role in reining in Evers’ spending proposals. 
In 2023, Evers pitched a $104 billion budget, which Republicans mostly tossed and rewrote from scratch. The Wisconsin Policy Forum noted that if approved in full, Evers’ plan would have left the state with a deficit.
However, Stein pointed out, Evers has vetoed Republican tax cut proposals, keeping the general fund higher than it would have been if he approved the cuts. 
""To some degree, both the Legislature and the governor in the last budget did some things that were favorable in terms of boosting the general fund balance,"" Stein said. 
But each also had ""proposals that would have been less favorable (to the general fund) that were blocked by the other side. So in that sense, it was sort of a joint effort.""
Beyond the political element, there’s also the overall state of the economy. 
If there was a recession, for example, tax collections from businesses could decline and the state might need to increase spending for people who lose their jobs and enroll in Medicaid, Stein said. 
So, Wisconsin’s financial health can’t really be credited to one person. But again, Evers doesn’t explicitly take responsibility in his tweet. 
Our ruling
The three parts of Evers’ claim are correct: Wisconsin’s general fund has ended with a surplus each year he’s been governor, the fund had a deficit before that, and the ""rainy day"" fund is at a record balance. 
The state’s general fund surplus actually went down in the last year, in part because federal pandemic aid that boosted Wisconsin’s finances has dried up. 
Although Evers doesn’t explicitly take credit for the state’s financial well-being, he definitely hints at it. There’s evidence to support his involvement, the full picture is bigger.
That includes the role of Republicans in paring down Evers’ budget proposal and broader economic conditions that influence how much money the state spends.

Neither Newsom nor California Democrats decriminalized looting. It remains illegal in California during a state of emergency, which Newsom declared Jan. 7 in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, or under an evacuation order. 
The state’s Penal Code 463, under the ""Burglary"" chapter, says that every person who commits burglary or grand theft ""during and within an affected county in a ‘state of emergency’ or a ‘local emergency,’ or under an ‘evacuation order,’ resulting from an earthquake, fire, flood, riot, or other natural (or manmade) disaster shall be guilty of the crime of looting, punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for (up to three years.)""
People who commit petty theft under the same circumstances — during a state of emergency, a local emergency or under an evacuation order because of a natural or manmade disaster — can be charged with a misdemeanor, which could lead to imprisonment in a county jail for six months.

In August, Newsom signed a bipartisan package of 10 bills on retail crime and property theft. None of those decriminalized looting.
President-elect Donald Trump had claimed falsely that because of Proposition 47, California does not charge people with a crime if the stolen goods are worth less than $950. According to that law, which California voters approved in 2014, people who steal items worth less than $950 would be charged with a misdemeanor. The law’s text does not mention looting.
In November 2024, California voters approved Proposition 36, which rolled back some of Proposition 47’s provisions, allowing offenders with two previous theft convictions to be charged with a felony, ""regardless of the value of the stolen property."" Newsom opposed the proposition; supporters of the legislation said it was needed because of increased property crime during the pandemic.
The Palisades, Eaton, Hurst, Auto and Scout fires had not been fully contained as of Jan. 14. The California Department of Forestry & Fire Protection reported 23 deaths as of the same date.

Oregon sent firefighting teams to help with the Los Angeles fires and California’s Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, safety-checked that equipment when the teams arrived.
California officials and the Oregon State Fire Marshal’s office have rebutted claims that lacking ""smog certification"" or needing ""emissions testing"" kept Oregon fire trucks from aiding Los Angeles fire response.
In a Jan. 11 X post, Newsom said Oregon had ""courageously sent CA some of their best firefighters and equipment — all have been here for days fighting these blazes."" He also linked to californiafirefacts.com, the website he launched to counter fire misinformation.

On Facebook, Cal Fire posted a video showcasing its ""pitstop for out-of-state help on LA fires,"" and describing its safety checks as ""proactive inspections and maintenance protocols"" that ensure the equipment is functioning properly.  It processed 133 to 134 vehicles in one day, an agency official in the Jan. 11 video said. 
McMorrow said the inspection takes ""about 30 minutes if there are no issues with the vehicle."" If any vehicle in the strike group fails the inspection, it will be pulled into the shop for repairs, which could slow down other vehicles in the strike team. 
""No vehicles from out of state have been turned around or refused service at Davis Mobile Equipment and all out-of-state vehicles have been serviced and are heading to or have arrived in Southern California,"" Cal Fire wrote Jan. 11 in the video comments. ""No emissions or SMOG testing was performed. All repairs were completed the same day with the exception of a couple because of parts but turnaround was early the next day."" 
McMorrow said the inspections are standard practice in the fire service to ""prevent problems on the fire line later."" 
""Wildland firefighting can take an engine and its crew into remote and rough places,"" she said.
Most engines that come to help from out of state are typically used in a call and then return to a station; during wildfires, these engines must be prepared to be out and operating daily for several weeks. No one wants a tire blowout, brake failure or other preventable issue to cause an accident or emergency in an already dangerous situation, McMorrow said. 
What about the Santa Monica Observer’s report?
Many social media posts mentioned reporting from the Santa Monica Observer — a site styled to look like a news organization and that has spread falsehoods before. As of Jan. 11, the site had retracted its Jan. 10 article, according to an archive of the page. 
""Our original story was based on a tweet that has since been deleted,"" an editor’s note appended to the story read. ""The original tweet is below.

A Jan. 10 Instagram video’s caption said, ""These fires were all planned to turn the Pacific Palisades region and those hills along Malibu into a Smart City in preparation for Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028.""
The person speaking in the video said the fires were ""planned"" and ""absolutely an attack.""
As evidence, the person pointed to ""shut off"" fire hydrants and funding cuts to the Los Angeles Fire Department. But that’s misleading. Hydrants ran dry during recent firefighting because the city’s water infrastructure was not built to respond to fires so large. And Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass approved budget cuts for the fire department, but later signed off on pay increases for firefighters.
Other users on Instagram and Threads made similar claims. Some of these posts showed a picture of Los Angeles’ Pacific Palisades neighborhood before the fires, with text reading, ""Watch them build the Olympics right in this area.""

Los Angeles will host the Summer Olympics and Paralympics in 2028, a decision city officials and the International Olympic Committee cemented in 2017.
Los Angeles does not plan to build much infrastructure for the 2028 Summer Games,  contrary to social media users’ claim.
The LA28 website’s FAQ page says the Summer Games are ""designed to fit the city as-is,"" utilizing Los Angeles’ existing venues and temporary facilities. The site says the 2028 Summer Games ""will be the first-ever Games to not build permanent infrastructure.""
The University of California, Los Angeles campus is to host the athletes’ living quarters, the website says. Existing Los Angeles venues and in the surrounding area will host the sporting events. Two venues in Oklahoma City are also listed as Summer Games sites.
As of Jan. 13, the wildfires hadn’t damaged any of the more than 80 venues designated for the 2028 Olympics. The venues listed on the LA28 website are not in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood or Malibu, California.

One persistent claim was that the owners of a massive California farming operation control most of the state’s water supply.
The progressive media and activism organization More Perfect Union made such a claim in an Instagram post that showed a 2-year-old video playing over an image of a wildfire.
""One billionaire couple owns almost all the water in California,"" the Jan. 8 Instagram post said. 
The video named Stewart and Lynda Resnick, owners of the Wonderful Co., and said they own ""a massive share of the state’s water system."" The company owns brands such as Wonderful Pistachios, Fiji Water, Wonderful Halos and Pom Wonderful, ahe popular bottled pomegranate juice. Forbes estimates the couple’s net worth is about $12.6 billion.

The post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)
The couple’s company has a majority stake in a water bank in the San Joaquin Valley and uses vast amounts of water to manage its nearly 130,000-acre California agriculture operation. But the claim that the Resnicks own nearly all — or even a large portion — of California’s water is a massive exaggeration. 
""No one would ever say, if you have a huge water bank in the San Joaquin Valley, and you have a lot of groundwater rights in the Salinas Valley, that someone would say you control most of the water in California — that’s preposterous,"" said Mark Gold, the water scarcity solutions director at the Natural Resources Defense Council and a Southern California Metropolitan Water District board member. 
(Screengrab from Instagram)
In a Jan. 12 press release, the Wonderful Co. denied the trending social media accusations, calling them ""uninformed, discredited, and false claims."" 
""There is zero truth that any individual or company, much less ours, owns or controls most of the water in California,"" the company said. ""It’s also not true we have anything to do with water supplied to Los Angeles. Water intended for municipal use is not taken for agricultural purposes or food production.""
The reason for the Los Angeles wildfires, and the difficulties fighting them, has nothing to do with who owns water further north or how it’s managed, as we previously fact-checked. Southern California has plenty of water stored, and local infrastructure problems are what hampered firefighters’ access to water in the Pacific Palisades.
""In the context of 10,000-plus homes being lost in the Eaton and Palisades fire, it’s completely irrelevant and has nothing to do with what just happened, and what's continuing to happen,"" Gold said. 
More Perfect Union spokesperson Georgia Parke said the statement ""could have been more precise, but the scope of the Resnick’s ownership of water in California is explained in the video.""
The Instagram video is clipped from a longer video and story that More Perfect Union published in 2022. However, that original reporting did not include the claim that the couple owns ""almost all"" of the state’s water. 
Resnicks control small fraction of California water
California’s water generally comes from two sources: surface water from rain and snow that is managed through reservoirs and canals, and groundwater from underground aquifers. The federal government, state government, local governments and private entities operate these systems to varying degrees. Landowners can also own the rights to water on their land.

The words “help” and “trafico” in a Google Maps aerial view of Los Angeles are connected to human trafficking.
By Ciara O'Rourke • January 27, 2025
Through a subsidiary called Westside Mutual Water Co., the Resnicks own a 57% stake in the Kern Water Bank, a groundwater storage project operated by public-private partnership in the San Joaquin Valley’s southern end. The bank is about 100 miles north of Los Angeles and supplies nearby areas with water for agricultural, municipal and industrial uses. In 1994, the Resnicks obtained a majority share of the bank, which was previously run by the state, through a series of negotiations that critics have derided as secretive. The Wonderful Co. also owns water rights across its farmland.
But those sources amount to a tiny percentage of California’s overall water, experts said. 
The Kern Water Bank can store up to 1.5 million acre-feet of water — close to 500 billion gallons — underground. As of 2021, the basin held 1 million acre-feet, about two-thirds of its capacity, Forbes reported, and the Resnicks don’t own all of it. An acre-foot is about 325,851 gallons.
By comparison, all the state’s groundwater basins combined can hold between 850 million and 1.3 billion acre-feet — more than 400 trillion gallons — according to the California Department of Water Resources. The state’s surface reservoirs can hold more than 40 million acre-feet, and they held about 24 million acre-feet at the end of September, above the historical average.
No one knows exactly how much water is actually stored in the state’s groundwater basins, and much of the water isn’t easily tapped, said Jeffrey Mount, a senior fellow in water policy at the Public Policy Institute of California, a think tank. But the Kern Water Bank represents only a tiny percentage of the state’s overall water, he said.
""This is vastly overstated,"" Mount said of the claim.
The Wonderful Co. said in its press release that it accounts for less than 1% of the state’s water usage each year. In 2021, Forbes estimated the company used about 150 billion gallons of water annually.  After publication, the Wonderful Co. confirmed to PolitiFact water usage in 2022 and 2023 was in line with that estimate.
In comparison, the state uses about 39 million acre-feet — more than 12 trillion gallons  — of water annually on average, with about 80% going to agriculture and 20% going to urban areas.
Our ruling
A social media post claimed that the Resnicks, the Wonderful Co.’s owners, own ""almost all the water in California."" 
The water bank the Resnicks majority own is a tiny fraction of all the state’s water. Combined, California’s groundwater basins alone can hold more than 566 times as much water as the water bank that the Resnicks majority own — and that doesn’t account for how much the state’s surface reservoirs hold. Wonderful Company’s water holdings have no connection to the wildfires raging in Los Angeles. 
We rate the claim that the Resnicks own almost all California’s water False.

A photo of a burning mansion that accompanied the claim shows an Ohio mansion that burned down in 2014. 
As of Jan. 14, California officials said the California wildfires had killed more than 24 people and destroyed more than 12,000 structures, including in the wealthy Pacific Palisades neighborhood. 
Combs’ Los Angeles home is on South Mapleton Drive, just west of Beverly Hills. The home is near the Palisades fire, but it is not in the burning area and not in an area with an evacuation warning, as of Jan. 14. According to maps on the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection website, the house is a little less than 5 miles east of the furthest reaches of the Palisades fire, and 1.5 miles from the nearest area with an evacuation warning. 
A lawyer for Combs did not respond to a request to comment on the claims. 
Combs listed the home for sale on Sept. 8, six months after federal agents searched it and days before he was arrested on federal sex trafficking and racketeering charges, People reported. The online listing for the 17,000 square foot, $61.5 million home shows it has not sold.

The claim that the house would ""enter into investigation"" soon or that evidence would have been lost in the purported fire also lacks any evidence and has been used to fuel unfounded claims that the Los Angeles fires are connected to Combs’ court case. The federal indictment said agents seized evidence, including narcotics, guns, ammunition, and ""more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil and lubricant"" from Combs’ homes in Los Angeles and Miami related to the alleged crimes in the March raid.
Federal prosecutors allege combs led a racketeering conspiracy and used abuse, threats and coercion to engage in sex trafficking and other crimes. Combs has pleaded not guilty and is being held in a Brooklyn jail awaiting trial. 
Our ruling
Online posts claimed Combs’ $61 million Los Angeles mansion burned down during the wildfires. 
But the house was nearly 5 miles from the fires as of Jan. 14, in a neighborhood far outside the evacuation zone. The photo included in the post showed a 2014 Ohio house fire.

Using the words on that news report’s chyron — ""Deadly Eaton fire burns 10,600+ acres in San Gabriel Valley"" — we traced the interview using TV Eyes, a media monitoring site, to KTLA’s Jan. 8 live coverage of the fires. We also found that video on KTLA’s YouTube page.
In that video, KTLA reporter Chip Yost said, ""Basically, the folks who live here and their friends emptied this house out of a bunch of their stuff just in case the fire got here,"" as the camera panned across the street to show items, some in white bags, on a sidewalk. Included was a blue, wheeled trash bin, like the one seen in the background of posts claiming to show a looter carrying a white bag.
The camera returned to Yost, who was standing in front of a green home in Altadena that looked like the one seen in the Instagram video and was purportedly looted. He interviewed a woman who said she lived there with her three children.
At one point, the camera panned to the woman’s house, showing a street address of 161. That’s the same house address that showed on the front of the house in the Instagram post that said it showed looting. In the original TV report, a young man wearing a blue hooded sweatshirt and light-colored pants walked out of the house — attire that matched that worn by the person carrying the white bag at the introduction of the Instagram video that claimed it showed looting. ""That’s my son,"" the woman told Yost.

Mombasa, for example, wasn’t part of Kenya when Obama was born; it was part of Zanzibar until December 1963.
Other news outlets have also raised red flags, such as the date given for Obama’s mother’s birth: ""11/29/1942."" Kenya formats its dates day/month/year, as does Great Britain; when Obama was born in 1961, Kenya was still under British rule.

FactCheck.org reporters went to Chicago, where Obama’s campaign headquarters was based, to hold the document and examine it closely. They concluded that it was legitimate. 
In October 2008, Dr. Chiyome Fukino, then director of the Hawaii Department of Health, issued a statement saying that he and the registrar of vital statistics ""who has the statutory authority to oversee and maintain these types of vital records"" had personally seen and verified that the health department had Obama’s original birth certificate on record. 
Janice Okubo, a health department spokesperson, told us that birth certificates evolve over the decades, and there are surely differences between what Obama’s looked like when he was born and how the documents look today. 
As we’ve reported, if there had been a plot to forge a birth certificate so that Obama could run for office, it would have originated the day he was born. 
Will Hoover, who wrote a 2008 story for the Honolulu Advertiser about Obama’s childhood in Hawaii, told PolitiFact that he reviewed microfilm archives and found two birth announcements for Obama. One was in the Honolulu Advertiser on Aug. 13, 1961, 1961, and the other was in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin the next day. They both said the same thing: ""Mr. and Mrs. Barack H. Obama, 6085 Kalanianaole Highway, son, Aug. 4."" The health department submitted both announcements; not Obama’s family.
""Take a second and think about that,"" PolitiFact reported in 2009. ""In order to phony those notices up, it would have required the complicity of the state Health Department and two independent newspapers — on the off chance this unnamed child might want to one day be president of the United States.""

The Threads post follows a trend we’ve seen before: When wildfires engulfed parts of Maui, Hawaii, in August 2023 and Texas in early 2024, some social media users claimed directed energy weapons caused the destruction; PolitiFact rated those claims False. 
Already, we’ve fact-checked a claim that footage Fox News aired Jan. 7 showed directed energy weapons starting the fires in California — that’s False.
Like those false claims, this post about the California wildfires is inaccurate in multiple ways, experts on directed energy weapons and wildfires said. 
Directed energy weapons fire concentrated energy at light speed and might include high-energy lasers and high-power microwave weapons, the federal Government Accountability Office reported.
The weapons wouldn’t spare items from destruction just because they are blue. 
Iain Boyd, an aerospace engineering sciences professor at the University of Colorado Boulder and Director of the Center for National Security Initiatives, has repeatedly told news organizations including The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse that although high-energy lasers might interact differently with items made of different materials or colors, an item of a certain color wouldn’t be immune. 
""If there is enough energy in a laser beam to start a large fire, then it will burn through the material no matter what its color,"" Boyd told Agence France-Presse in 2023. 
Also, whatever items survive a wildfire — whether they’re blue or any other color — do not prove directed energy weapons figured in the catastrophe. Wildfire behavior experts told PolitiFact that when wildfires burn, they don’t leave a uniform pattern of devastation.
""It’s absolutely not surprising that there’s uneven patterns in what we call fire effects,"" said Maureen Kennedy, associate professor in quantitative fire ecology and forest management at the University of Washington, Tacoma. ""Fires are really subject to randomness."" 
Janice Coen, project scientist at the U.S. National Science Foundation’s National Center for Atmospheric Research, said that this varied destruction from wildfires is called the ""fire mosaic.""
""There is nothing inherently suspicious about uneven patterns of damage,"" Coen said. ""Severely burned areas can lie next to untouched areas. One home can be destroyed while the one next to it is untouched."" 
That has happened during the greater Los Angeles fires: CNN interviewed an Altadena, California, resident whose house burned down. A nearby home appeared largely unscathed, however.

Kennedy said that’s largely because sudden wind shifts can redirect heat and determine what combusts and what doesn’t, though she added that factors including moisture differences and topography can also influence fire behavior. 
""In the urban environment, there are differences possibly simply with landscaping and building materials and the proximity to the other fuels,"" she said. ""The lucky house — the one that survived — might have been just far enough from the ones that were burning in the moments that the wind shifted that it was the lucky one to have survived.""
Kennedy expressed no suspicion about the fires being caused by directed energy weapons. 
""These fire events are pretty consistent with our understanding of how fires work in that area,"" she said.
The fires’ causes are so far unknown, but powerful Santa Ana winds and the abnormally dry conditions in Southern California sped the wildfire’s spread. 
Our ruling
A Threads post said, ""blue items that survive"" the California wildfires are ""indicative of DEW's (Directed Energy Weapons).""
Directed energy weapons wouldn’t spare items from destruction just because they are blue, one  expert said. And when wildfires burn, they don’t leave a uniform pattern of total devastation, wildfire science experts told PolitiFact. This means that just because the fires might spare some blue items, it won’t prove that directed energy weapons were involved in the catastrophe.
We rate this claim False.

""No water in the fire hydrants, no money in FEMA. This is what Joe Biden is leaving me. Thanks Joe!"" Trump wrote on TruthSocial.
But FEMA isn’t broke.
On Dec. 21, President Joe Biden averted a government shutdown by signing a federal spending bill  that directed $29 billion to FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund, part of a broader $100 billion package for disasters in general. This came after calls for increased funding in the aftermath of Hurricanes Helene and Milton that struck the southeastern U.S. in September and October, respectively.
Biden on Jan. 8 also approved California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s request for a major disaster declaration, a move that makes federal resources, including funding, readily available.
A FEMA spokesperson told PolitiFact on Jan. 8 that Congress’ federal spending bill provided the agency with the funding and resources it needs to respond to California’s disaster. The Disaster Relief Fund balance is now about $27 billion, the spokesperson said.
Congress funds migrant and disaster relief programs separately. And Trump’s administration, not Biden’s, shifted FEMA funding — including money from the Disaster Relief Fund — to address immigration.

Starting in 2019, during Trump’s first term, Congress allocated money to FEMA to include some migrants in its Emergency Food and Shelter Program, which had previously been used only for people dealing with hunger and homelessness. The FEMA money was sent to local and state governments and nonprofit organizations to provide services to immigrants officials had released into the U.S. to await court proceedings. Trump’s term also saw the transfer of about $155 million from FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund to Immigration and Customs Enforcement in 2019 for the detainment of migrants.
In 2023, Congress also directed FEMA and Customs and Border Protection to create the Shelter and Services Program to support nonfederal entities that offered shelter for migrants after they are released from the Department of Homeland Security. That program phased out support for migrants that drew from the Emergency Food and Shelter Program and its funding is allocated to Customs and Border Patrol but administered by FEMA.
FEMA has previously addressed claims that its disaster relief funds have been diverted to immigration issues. ""This is false,"" the agency said in an Oct. 3 statement. ""Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other, non-disaster related efforts.""
Joshua Sewell, research and policy director at Taxpayers for Common Sense, told PolitiFact in October, ""The Disaster Relief Fund has nothing to do with any migrant assistance account because all that spending is from separate funds.""

This is not a new claim. Besides the ""smart island"" claim about Maui’s wildfires, we have rated similar claims False about wildfires in Canada and Spain’s Canary Islands, noting that installing smart city technologies — which collect information to help cities run more efficiently — would not require destroying existing infrastructure.
California’s Department of Forestry and Fire Protection has reported that the Palisades, Eaton and Hurst fires started Jan. 7 in Southern California. On Jan. 8, the department reported the Woodley, Lidia and Sunset fires had started in Los Angeles County. As of Jan. 9, the Woodley (according to the department’s website) and Sunset (according to NBC News) fires are 100% contained. As of Jan. 9, the Palisades and Eaton fires are zero percent contained while the Lidia fire is 60% contained and the Hurst fire 10% contained.
Although the Los Angeles County Fire Department is still investigating what caused the multiple fires, NBC News reported that the fires were sparked by a combination of dry conditions and powerful winds.
Why the fires weren’t caused for ‘smart cities’ and the UN’s 2030 agenda 
Contrary to the social media claims, the wildfires were not caused to make way for ""smart cities"" and the United Nations’ 2030 agenda. Here’s some background:
In 2015, the United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which, according to its website, includes 17 sustainable development goals to end world poverty, protect the planet and tackle inequalities. 
Among them is Goal 11: ""Make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable,"" which includes what some people have termed  ""smart cities.""
A 2020 United Nations document called People-Smart Sustainable Cities says: 
""The International Telecommunication Union and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe worked together to define a smart sustainable city as ‘an innovative city that uses information and communication technologies and other means to improve quality of life, efficiency of urban operation and services, and competitiveness, while ensuring that it meets the needs of present and future generations with respect to economic, social, environmental as well as cultural aspects.’"" 
But Shoshanna Saxe, an associate professor in the University of Toronto’s Department of Civil & Mineral Engineering, told PolitiFact in 2023 that ""smart cities"" has ""been used so many times that it sort of lost all meaning."" 
Saxe said that cities often use the term to describe simpler things, such as creating a smartphone app for residents to contact the city, or open data platforms to make research and development more accessible. 
""A lot of the stuff people are currently calling their smart-city initiatives are really run of the mill operating a city in the 21st century,"" she said, including using smart electric grids to more efficiently meet energy needs.
PolitiFact found no credible evidence or reports that Los Angeles or other U.S. areas are being destroyed to build smart cities.

Plus, cities don’t need to destroy existing development to apply smart city technology, which mostly involves adding sensors or software to existing infrastructure.
The SmartLA 2028 initiative, which the city’s Information Technology Agency oversees, mentions renovating metro rail and bus systems to improve mobility for residents. (Los Angeles will host the Summer Olympics in 2028.) 
The plan also calls for applying technology to help residents with disabilities and creating technology that detects fire, violence or other health risks before residents call 911. Other goals include increasing internet access speeds and accessibility for underserved communities. Another would equip Los Angeles International Airport’s terminals with ""multi-lingual electronic wayfinding"" during the Olympics and Paralympics. The report doesn’t mention big plans for destroying and rebuilding the city.
Our ruling
A Threads comment suggests Southern California’s raging wildfires ""are a deliberate criminal land grab in preparation for Agenda 2030 and smart cities.""
That isn’t true. 
Officials have not determined the wildfires’ cause, but there’s no credible evidence that they were set intentionally to advance ""smart cities"" or the United Nations 2030 Agenda.
The U.N.’s  agenda includes building sustainable cities as one of its goals. This includes ""smart cities,"" which add technology to improve quality of life, urban operations and service efficiency.
The SmartLA 2028 initiative doesn’t propose rebuilding the city but rather adding technology to improve residents’ lives. 
Also, installing smart city technology in a city would not require intentional destruction of existing infrastructure.

"Bernie Sanders
stated on January 2, 2025 in a statement to the media:","H-1B guest workers are “being employed as dog trainers, massage therapists, cooks, and English teachers.”","stated on January 2, 2025 in a statement to the media:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/jan/09/bernie-sanders/are-h-1b-visa-holders-hired-as-dog-trainers-massag/,,"A fight erupted on social media in late December pitting allies of President-elect Donald Trump against one another on the topic of visas for highly skilled immigrants.
MAGA influencer Laura Loomer denounced the H-1B visa program that allows U.S. employers to hire foreign workers with certain skill sets. Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon called it a ""scam."" On the other side, billionaire Elon Musk, a former H-1B visa holder whose companies employ such visa holders, called for the program’s reform but defended it as an important talent recruitment mechanism.
Trump, who sought reforms of the H-1B program during his first presidential term, sided with Musk. 
""I have many H-1B visas on my properties,"" Trump told the New York Post in late December. ""I’ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It’s a great program.""
Days later, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., disputed Musk, saying corporations abuse the program as a way to get richer and should recruit American workers first.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
""If this program is really supposed to be about importing workers with highly advanced degrees in science and technology, why are H-1B guest workers being employed as dog trainers, massage therapists, cooks, and English teachers? Can we really not find English teachers in America?""
During the 2024 campaign, Trump’s immigration agenda largely focused on promises to reduce illegal immigration; he didn’t talk much about work visas. But the recent social media battle may foreshadow tensions within the incoming Trump administration over the future of nonimmigrant visas.
""It is too early to tell which side will prevail in this battle,"" said Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, a retired Cornell University immigration law professor. ""People like Elon Musk want to preserve H-1B visas. Other Trump administration officials like Stephen Miller want to restrict all immigration, including H-1Bs.""   
We examined Sanders’ statement about the types of workers who obtain H-1B visas. Here’s the rub with his claim: Employers can — and have — sought foreign workers as dog trainers and massage therapists. But Sanders is plucking out very rare situations (teachers are more common). The majority of people with the visas have jobs in the tech industry, not the jobs Sanders cited.
Majority of H-1B holders are in computer jobs, but some are teachers
The H-1B visa program lets employers temporarily hire foreign workers in specialty fields. The majority of these workers have been hired in STEM occupations, with about two-thirds working in computer-related fields, according to the Congressional Research Service. STEM refers to science, technology, engineering and math occupations. Most H-1B visa holders come from India.
Prospective H-1B employers must attest that they will pay the H-1B worker the greater of the actual wages paid to similar employees or the prevailing wages for that occupation.
To qualify for the nonimmigrant visa, the worker must hold a specialized degree, license or training required by the occupation. The status is generally valid for up to three years and renewable for another three years, but can be extended if the employer sponsors the worker for a green card. 
Congress caps annual new H-1B visas at 85,000 per fiscal year, including 20,000 for noncitizens who earned advanced degrees.
The program has long been a subject of debate. Proponents say the visas allow American employers to fill gaps and allow them to compete with other countries and recruit the ""best minds."" Critics point to fraud or abuse in the program and say they favor policies that incentivize hiring Americans.
Employers apply to the Labor Department to use the program. Virtually every application is approved, allowing employers to apply for employee visas through the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Department of State.
In 2023, most visa approvals were for people who work in computer-related jobs; 6% went to people working in education, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, although the agency’s data didn’t specify how many were English teachers. It also did not mention dog trainers, cooks or massage therapists. 
Asked for evidence behind Sanders’ statement, a Sanders spokesperson sent us links from a third-party website that showed employers’ Labor Department applications filed from 2020 to 2024 included requests for visas for dog trainers, massage therapists, English teachers and even cooks.
But those links did not show whether the applications were approved (the government calls that ""certified"") or whether the employers were successful in getting the visas. And it represented a tiny speck of the applications — for example, three applications for the dog trainers, two for massage therapists and 10 for cooks. Requests for English teachers were more plentiful in the data Sanders’ office pointed us to — about 100 — but still represented a small fraction of the overall pool of applications filed during those years.
""There are a decent number of H-1Bs for English teachers, and that's not inappropriate because the jobs usually require a college degree,"" said David Bier, immigration studies director at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""They are usually teaching English as a second language, and many schools think it is helpful to know Spanish or another language while teaching English. It can be especially difficult for rural districts to find teachers in general, let alone ones with dual language ability."" 
The Dallas Morning News, a PolitiFact partner, reported that in fiscal year 2022, the Dallas school district sponsored 232 workers on H-1B visas, the largest number of any district in the country. Most of the H-1B holders were bilingual teachers in the district, where about half of the students do not speak English as their primary language. The district has hired teachers through the H-1B program for 25 years. 
Smaller school districts have also filled vacancies with H-1B visas. Jackson, Mississippi, public schools, which have about 17,000 students, have five high school English teachers on H-1B visas, plus teachers for math and science, said Sherwin Johnson, a district spokesperson. The teachers fill critical shortage areas, Johnson said.
Nationwide teacher shortages, and scarcity of qualified bilingual teachers, have been widely reported. But does the United States have a shortage of dog trainers?
Sanders is barking up the wrong tree here. The data Sanders’ sent us showed only two organizations that sought dog trainers, and we reached one of them.
Patrick Glines, CEO of Guide Dogs of Texas, told PolitiFact that before he applied for a visa, he advertised for about two years to fill a position to train dogs for people who are blind, and had no luck. The job of training dogs for people who are blind is ""incredibly niche"" and is different from training a dog who has behavior issues, Glines said. It takes about three years until someone can do the job on their own.
Glines ended up training a man in Chile, so he hired him through an H-1B visa.

""In this situation, it has been a significant help for us,"" Glines said. ""It is absolutely a one-off for me, I doubt I will ever apply for another one. In this one instance it has been incredibly beneficial for people who are blind in Texas.""
The Labor Department posts employers applications online each quarter, and for the most recent quarter, most of the jobs we saw were within the tech and sciences sectors — some for cooks or teachers and only one for a massage therapist. 
Employers must prove that a job meets the visa requirements.  
""Technically, the rule for H-1B is that the job requires the training that comes with at least a bachelor’s level education or its equivalent,"" said Daniel Costa, director of immigration law and policy research at the Economic Policy Institute. ""So if it is a specialized masseuse job that requires that level of education, theoretically it could qualify. The burden would be on the employer to make the case to USCIS.""
Costa noted that a law firm wrote on its website that, ""Years ago, we saw H-1B approvals for a massage therapist, an airline pilot, and an assistant college sports coach. In most cases these jobs do not require a bachelor’s degree and would almost definitely not be approved today."" (The Massachusetts law firm has since closed.)
We asked Sanders’ spokesperson whether he had data showing how many H-1B visa holders were ultimately hired as English teachers, cooks, massage therapists and dog trainers and did not get a reply to that question. To see what H-1B applications were granted, we would need access to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services data (generally filing Freedom of Information Requests with the federal government is a lengthy process.) 
Our ruling
Sanders said H-1B guest workers are ""being employed as dog trainers, massage therapists, cooks, and English teachers.""
Data shows the majority of the workers who obtain H-1B visas work in science and technology fields.  In 2023, about 65% of approved petitions were for workers in computer-related jobs and 6% were in education, but they were not all English teachers. 
Although Sanders’ office pointed to a sampling of employer applications submitted to the Labor Department requesting visas for massage therapists, cooks and dog trainers, that data didn’t show how many actually got visas. And his statement ignored that in some cases even these occupations require specialized training, such as being able to train dogs for blind people or teaching students in two languages.
By plucking out random applications, Sanders leaves voters with a distorted picture of the majority of the job titles held by H-1B visa holders. 
The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

A day later, however, Trump said the vote counting continues.
""We had a landslide election,"" Trump said at the Jan. 7 press conference at Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Palm Beach, Florida. ""We won every swing state. We won the popular vote by millions and millions of people. Nobody even knows how many people, millions, and they're still counting in some areas.""
Trump said, ""We’ve got to fix the election so that we get honest counts and they get done by 10 o'clock in the evening or something thereabouts. There are places where they're still counting votes.""
Trump’s comments create the impression that presidential race ballots are still being counted. We asked his presidential transition team for his evidence and got no reply.
The votes have been counted. The states have certified the votes, the Electoral College has voted and Congress has accepted the results. States set deadlines to certify results in November or December. And we do know how many more people voted for Trump than voted for Vice President Kamala Harris — about 2.3 million — although the Electoral College, not the popular vote, determines the outcome.

""All the votes in the general election have been counted,"" said Mark Lindeman, policy and strategy director at Verified Voting, a nonprofit group with election technology expertise. ""All this is exactly how presidential elections are supposed to work.""
California is often the last state to finish counting ballots because of its law’s long timelines and because it mails ballots to all active voters. By law, its county elections officials have 30 days to count ballots after Election Day. California’s secretary of state certified the statewide results Dec. 13.
When federal lawmakers convened Jan. 6, they read aloud the tally of electoral votes from each state and certified the election results.
""I know of no place that hasn’t finished their initial count long ago,"" said David Becker. executive director and founder of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, a nonpartisan organization that works with election officials from both political parties.
It is possible for races with close margins to end in litigation months after Election Day — it took about eight months to resolve the 2008 Minnesota Senate race.
One prominent down-ballot race, for a seat on the North Carolina Supreme Court, remains officially unsettled. That’s because the Republican candidate is challenging the certified results.
On Jan. 7, the North Carolina Supreme Court, controlled 5-2 by Republican justices, blocked state election officials from certifying Democratic Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs as the winner. The court ruled that more time was needed to investigate claims by the Republican challenger, state appellate judge Jefferson Griffin, who is seeking to have more than 60,000 ballots tossed. WRAL, PolitiFact’s North Carolina partner, reported that the State Board of Elections in December rejected Griffin’s claims. 
That litigation is unrelated to Trump’s victory. The North Carolina state board of elections certified Trump’s win Nov. 26.
In Florida, litigation filed by the Republican opponent of Democratic Rep. Kathy Castor continues. Castor, who won about 57% of the vote, was sworn into Congress on Jan. 6. Certified state house races in Minnesota and Georgia also remain in litigation, according to Democracy Docket, a voting rights news platform that tracks election litigation. These lawsuits do not mean that election officials are still counting votes, it means they are fighting over election procedures or which votes should have been counted.
Some states audit their results after the election, even after those results were officially finalized, said Tammy Patrick, an elections expert at the National Association of Election Officials, a professional organization for state election directors.
""But they are not ‘still counting’ ballots in any jurisdiction in the union,"" Patrick said.

Trump’s mention of a 10 p.m. deadline for counting harks back to his 2024 campaign calls to have all ballots counted on election night.
Media outlets project election winners; when the margins are wide enough, they could make such calls comfortably on election night or the next day. But state laws — not the White House or Congress — dictate state processes that yield final, certified election results. Those laws include when mail ballots, including those from overseas service members, must be received and when election officials can start processing and tabulating ballots. If some states take longer to finish counting, it doesn’t signal wrongdoing. 
Our ruling
Trump said, ""They’re still counting the (2024 election) vote in some areas.""
He gave the impression that two months after Election Day, ballots are still being tabulated in the presidential race. That’s not happening.
States certified their results by December, and Congress accepted the Electoral College results the day before Trump made this claim.
Some state and local races remain under litigation, but that is not the same as counting ballots.

Hurricane Helene made landfall in North Carolina on Sept. 27, killing 103 people. State budget officials estimate the storm caused more than $50 billion in damage.
People emailed WRAL-TV, PolitiFact’s North Carolina partner, asking whether the generator claims are true.
Mitchell County authorities say the claims are inaccurate, and state leaders who coordinate hurricane relief said they don’t know about any generators being stolen.
Mitchell County issued a public letter signed by County Manager Allen Cook, Sheriff Donald Street and the county’s emergency director, Kolby Silver.
In the letter, the officials said the claims stemmed from ""a misunderstanding by an out-of-town individual attempting to gain attention.""
The person who posted the TikTok video didn’t respond to a request for comment.
The letter said the county requested from the state 40 generators, which Samaritan’s Purse, a Boone, North Carolina-based nonprofit organization, had donated. Samaritan’s Purse helped with storm recovery.
The North Carolina National Guard delivered the generators by helicopter Oct. 15 to Bowman Middle School in Bakersville. The Mitchell County sheriff’s office had used the school as a relief distribution center; the school was visible in the background as the TikTok video began.

A TikTok video said Mitchell County sheriff’s deputies stole generators intended for Hurricane Helene’s victims.
The person who posted the video provided no proof to support the claim.
Mitchell County officials say it’s inaccurate, and that the nonprofit Samaritan’s Purse donated the generators and sheriff’s deputies distributed them. A Samaritan’s Purse spokesperson said the organization has received no formal complaints or reports of its generators being stolen.

In the post’s comments, the Facebook user linked to a blog post titled, ""Federal manhunt underway after … "" The site didn’t signal when the post was written. 
Under the headline, the blog post read: ""A federal manhunt is underway for four suspects who planted explosives in New Orleans before a deadly (attack)."" It did not offer more information about the four purported ""suspects"" nor did it provide any details about the ""second attack in New Orleans"" that the Facebook post had mentioned. 
When we searched using Google and the Nexis news archive, we found no credible reports or information supporting claims that there was a second attack in New Orleans in the days following the Jan. 1 truck attack. 
We also found no reports that the FBI is pursuing four suspects in the Jan. 1 attack or a subsequent attack.
Since Jan. 2, the FBI has said that investigators believe Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a U.S. Army veteran and American citizen from Texas, acted alone when he drove a pickup truck into a crowd on a busy street in New Orleans’ French Quarter. Police shot and killed Jabbar in a shootout during the attack, officials said.
Reports that Jabbar acted alone contradicted an initial FBI update, which might have contributed to online speculation that authorities were pursuing multiple suspects. During a Jan. 1 press conference, FBI Assistant Special in Charge Alethea Duncan told reporters: ""We do not believe that Jabbar was solely responsible."" 
As the FBI investigation has progressed, investigators have said they believe Jabbar acted alone and they are investigating the incident as a premeditated act of terrorism.
""This investigation is only a little more than 24 hours old,"" FBI Deputy Assistant Director Christopher Raia said Jan. 2. ""We do not assess, at this point, that anyone else is involved in this attack except for Shamsud-Din Jabbar.""

"Social Media
stated on December 1, 2024 in X, formerly Twitter:","“Trump won 18-to-24-year-olds in Wisconsin.""","stated on December 1, 2024 in X, formerly Twitter:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/jan/06/social-media/poll-shows-trump-won-18-24-year-olds-in-wisconsin/,,"President-elect Donald Trump won Wisconsin by nearly 30,000 votes after losing the state four years ago by some 20,000 votes, but did he really win 18-to-24-year-olds in the state?
There have been a lot of different takes on how Trump took the state over Vice President Kamala Harris, but one in particular caught our eye:
""Trump won 18-24 year olds in Wisconsin,"" according to a Dec. 1, 2024, X post from Luc J. Gagnon@LakePoliticsYT.  Gagnon, according to his profile, is a ""progressive Republican"" and ""ballot chaser"" for Turning Point Action and Republican Party of Milwaukee County.
The claim piqued PolitiFact Wisconsin’s interest because four years earlier, in 2020, in Wisconsin, 14% of all votes cast came from young voters, ages 18 to 29. Of these, 58% supported Joe Biden, while 39% backed Donald Trump, according to the CIRCLE, which also estimated that young people turned out at a higher rate in 2020 than in 2016. 
The impact of that demographic, especially youth of color’s support for Biden, was decisive in races across the country, according to the CIRCLE (the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement), which describes itself as a non-partisan, independent research organization focused on youth civic engagement.

In his post, Gagnon included a table showing Trump winning 50% of the 18-to-24-year-old vote in Wisconsin, while Harris received 48%. Gagnon did not provide a source for his figures, and attempts to reach him for comment were not successful. However, a quick Google search finds that the figures originate from a Nov. 19, 2024, CNN exit poll.   
Gagnon’s social media post garnered 80.9K views and 2.1K likes on X. Thus, we are attributing the claim to social media for purposes of this fact check.
Elections experts weigh in 
Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll, noting the figures were from CNN exit polling, pointed out that the post skipped the first age table for Wisconsin voters, which looks at a slightly different demographic: 18-to-29-year-old Wisconsin voters. 
A closer look at that group shows Harris at 49% and Trump at 48%. The post instead goes for the narrower second one, 18-to-24, which indeed had Trump at 50% and Harris at 48%. 
Franklin also pointed out that there is a quite different result from the data provided by AP-Votecast, which is used by Fox News. That data show a strong Harris win among 18-to-29-year-olds — 61% to 38% — but did not provide a breakdown for 18-to-24-year-olds.
""Which of these is ‘right’ is difficult to know,"" Franklin said in an email. ""Exit polls and the AP Votecast, are attempts to capture voter behavior at the moment of the election, but like all polls they are subject to sampling variability and to non-response issues. For small groups of the electorate (9% to 14% in this case in both polls) the potential for both sampling variation and non-response issues is greater than for larger groups."" 
In other words, the smaller the group examined, the greater the margin of error.
NORC is a nonprofit research organization at the University of Chicago that conducts a survey used by the Associated Press and Fox News under the brand AP VoteCast, which debuted in 2018. 
NBC News in explaining how exit polls work, said that since 2003, Edison Research, a firm that specializes in collecting election data, has conducted exit polls on behalf of the National Election Pool. The NEP is a consortium of media networks — ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC News — that pools together resources for one collective vote count and exit poll operation. 
In the coming weeks and months there will be surveys from shortly after the election that are matched to the state voter files to give a measure of people who actually voted in the election, and their survey responses, Franklin said.
Barry C. Burden, University of Wisconsin-Madison political science professor and director of the university’s Elections Research Center, said there is not sufficiently reliable data to conclude which candidate got more votes among young people — or any other age group — in Wisconsin.
""Exit polls such as the one Gagnon references are the most immediate source for understanding how groups voted in the election, so they are widely used to explore voting patterns,"" Burden said in an email. ""But exit polls are known to have systematic errors, especially for estimating vote choices in subgroups such as 18-24 year olds, who make up a small share of the sample and can be a difficult group to survey. There is also a margin of error to consider, as in any other survey. As a result, it is not reasonable to conclude at this point that Trump won over young voters in Wisconsin.""

The U.S. House Select Committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol “deleted and destroyed all of the information that they collected over two years.”
By Samantha Putterman • January 24, 2025
Burden said more high-quality data analysis will not emerge until early 2025 because it simply takes time to gather data in more scientific surveys or to use official state voter data to estimate how individuals voted.
""At most we can conclude from exit polls that the vote choices of young voters in Wisconsin were probably more evenly divided between the parties than in recent elections,"" Burden said.
What about any non-poll evidence on the matter?
A Wisconsin Public Radio report also noted that Trump made big gains in voting wards around universities, according to data compiled by Marquette University researcher John Johnson. 
For example, WPR said, in four wards around the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, Biden beat Trump by over 1,000 votes in 2020. This year, with over 4,000 votes cast, Harris eked out a mere 77-vote win.
Also, WPR reported, Trump more than doubled his vote count in seven student-populated wards around Marquette University. He diminished Democrats’ winning margin there from 62% to 38%.
Our ruling
A social media post said ""Trump won 18-24 year olds in Wisconsin."" 
A CNN exit poll does indeed show Trump winning that age group over Harris 50% to 48%.  The CNN poll does show that, but the picture is muddier when you look at other polls, slightly wider groups and consider that the polls themselves have a wide margin of error for what amounts to a small slice of the electorate.
Indeed, that same poll shows a different outcome when the demographic range is widened to ages 18 to 29, which shows Harris over Trump 49% to 48%. And looking at AP Votecast figures quoted by Fox News, Harris won 18-to-29-year-old Wisconsin voters at 61% while Trump received 38% of that demographic. 
Elections experts say exit polls are known to have systematic errors, and more time is needed for high-quality data analysis to determine a better understanding of how Wisconsin’s young people voted in the election. 
Still, those polls are the best information we have at this time and the post quoted the poll accurately.

"Ron Johnson
stated on November 17, 2024 in TV interview:",“There's never been a placebo-controlled study on childhood vaccines.”,"stated on November 17, 2024 in TV interview:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/jan/02/ron-johnson/yes-there-have-been-placebo-controlled-studies-on/,,"In picking Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, President-elect Donald Trump is elevating a small but growing segment of the population that distrusts vaccines and spreads or follows misinformation about them. 
Kennedy is a long-time vaccine skeptic who founded the major anti-vaccine group Children’s Health Defense and has repeatedly promoted a debunked theory that vaccines cause autism. 
Although he has recently distanced himself somewhat from this stance, declaring he would not ""take away anybody’s vaccines"" after Trump was elected, his unorthodox views on medicine are raising concern from medical professionals — and some on Capitol Hill. (That includes Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who wrote in a Dec. 13, 2024, statement that ""efforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures are not just uninformed — they’re dangerous,"" and ""anyone seeking the Senate’s consent to serve in the incoming Administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts."" 
Kennedy has an ally, however, in Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., a skeptic of COVID-19 vaccines who has promoted vaccine falsehoods. Johnson said on X that he ""could not be happier"" about Trump tapping Kennedy, and said he hopes to work ""very closely"" with him on exploring issues like vaccine efficacy. 
Asked on WISN Upfront Nov. 17, 2024, about his praise for Kennedy and false claims about vaccines causing autism, Johnson said he wants to look at ""uncorrupted"" science when determining vaccine safety and that people ""need to have the courage to ask what is causing this explosion"" in autism and chronic illness.

In fact, Johnson said, ""There’s never been a placebo-controlled study on childhood vaccines. Not one."" 
Medical experts say he’s wrong on that.  
Vaccine skeptics debate meaning of ‘placebo’
Asked for evidence of his claim, a spokesperson for Johnson sent a tweet from Aaron Siri, an attorney advising Kennedy. Siri shared a chart from the vaccine-skeptical group Informed Consent Action Network showing 17 vaccines that they allege were not licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ""based on a long-term placebo-controlled trial,"" including vaccines for whooping cough; measles, mumps and rubella; HPV; COVID-19 and influenza. 
Johnson’s office also shared an interview Kennedy did on The Joe Rogan Experience in which he recalled an exchange with Dr. Anthony Fauci, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Kennedy claimed he asked Fauci to present him with evidence that vaccines recommended for Americans had been tested in a placebo-controlled study, and that Fauci could not. 
Placebo-controlled trials are considered the gold standard for testing the safety and efficacy of a new vaccine, according to experts from the World Health Organization. The placebo exists to mimic the experience of getting the vaccine so the people receiving it don’t know which group they’re in. 
Some groups that are skeptical of vaccine safety take issue with the definition of a placebo. Dr. Paul Offit, a physician and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, wrote July 1, 2023, on Substack that the Informed Consent Action Network argues that the only true placebos are water and saltwater, ""which isn’t true.""
""Indeed, a wide range of placebos have been used in vaccine trials,"" Offit wrote. ""These placebos might contain buffers, stabilizing agents, emulsifying agents, or adjuvants, like aluminum salts. They might contain sodium citrate, sodium phosphate, sucrose or polysorbate-80 … all meet the FDA criteria for a placebo."" 
For example, RotaTeq, a vaccine for rotavirus, appears on the Informed Consent Action Network chart, which the group says was not licensed based on a placebo-controlled trial. According to the FDA, the placebo in that trial contained sucrose, sodium citrate, sodium phosphate, tissue culture medium and polysorbate 80. 
""When I look at the ICAN report, I’m just wondering whether they’re playing with words a little bit,"" Dr. William Moss, executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health said, using the abbreviation for the Informed Consent Action Network. ""We often think of a placebo as a comparator group … you have one group that receives the vaccine of interest and the other group receives something else."" 
There have been childhood vaccine studies using saltwater placebos  
Still, even using that narrower definition of a placebo — that it’s a simple saltwater solution — Johnson is wrong. 
Here are a selection of childhood vaccines that went through placebo-controlled trials where the placebo used was a saline solution: 
A rotavirus vaccine tested in South African infants and toddlers, as well as adults, between 2016 and 2017 
Four live measles vaccines tested in Israeli children in the 1960s
A human papillomavirus vaccine tested in adolescent boys and girls between 2003 and 2004 in 10 countries across North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia

“Pfizer just released its list of side effects of its COVID-19 vaccine.”
By Sofia Ahmed • January 30, 2025
Thus, it’s factually inaccurate for Johnson to say that there has never been a placebo-controlled study on childhood vaccines. 
Sometimes, new vaccines are tested against old vaccines 
Where else might these claims come from that vaccines haven’t undergone a placebo-controlled trial? 
In some situations, Moss said, the ""comparator group"" may receive a previously approved vaccine that targets the same disease to determine whether a new vaccine performs better (or performs the same, and is cheaper to make).
Why test a new vaccine against an old vaccine and not an inert placebo? 
If a vaccine against a disease already exists and is working, Moss said, it’s unethical to deprive children of it just to conduct a study. Doing so would put them unknowingly at risk of contracting and getting sick from that disease.
In those cases, Moss said, the vaccine given to the comparator group would be a licensed and approved vaccine that ""would have gone through all the hurdles it takes to get to that."" 
Johnson’s claim didn’t get into these details. He simply said there has been ""not one"" placebo-controlled study on childhood vaccines. And he’s wrong on that. 
Claims like these have ""the air of being scientific,"" Moss said. ""My sense is that this is an approach used by, say, RFK Jr., on calling for transparency in the data and more rigorous assessment of vaccines. Those are good things. I don’t think anyone would argue against that. They’re able to kind of twist it as a way to actually undermine vaccines, or at least induce skepticism."" 
Our ruling 
Johnson stated that ""there’s never been a placebo-controlled study on childhood vaccines."" 
Medical experts say the evidence his office provided takes a narrow view of what a placebo is. 
But even by that definition, there have been studies of childhood vaccines that were placebo-controlled.

The post is wrong about cancer and misleading about the drugs’ effectiveness in treating it. Cancer shares some properties with parasites, but it is not a parasite.
Cancer arises from cell mutations in a person’s body; it’s not a separate organism. These  mutations are inherited, develop randomly, or are caused by a person’s environment. A parasite is a separate organism that lives on or in another host organism and derives nutrients from it. 
Cancer shares most of its DNA with the person who has it, with some mutations. Parasites, like roundworms or tapeworms, have a completely different DNA from the host they enter. 
Cancer and parasites both grow or reproduce by drawing resources from the host and can resist the host’s immune responses. 
The post’s claim that ivermectin and other antiparasitics can ""cure"" cancer is also unproven. Neither the FDA nor the World Health Organization have approved ivermectin to treat cancer, but some studies have shown it can slow tumor growth in research settings. 
The Facebook post linked to a study called ""Ivermectin: a multifaceted drug with a potential beyond anti-parasitic therapy,"" published in March in Cureus, an academic journal. The study refers to several other studies that have shown ivermectin may inhibit tumor growth. 
But the Facebook post overstated the drug’s effectiveness. The study it linked to said ""extensive in vivo (live) studies and clinical trials are crucial to translating preclinical observations into therapeutic benefits for humans,"" and it cautioned against self-medicating with ivermectin.

Although some studies have shown ivermectin can slow tumor growth in research settings, it has not been extensively studied in humans. In studies, researchers have written  that more research needs to be done about the drug’s potential role in cancer treatment, and exactly how it could inhibit cancer growth.
Whether the body could tolerate doses of the drug at a high enough level to work is a key question that researchers haven’t determined, one study said. 
None of the studies involved testing the drug on humans, and the authors did not claim the drug should replace chemotherapy or other cancer treatment drugs. 
""These studies are preclinical studies which means they have not gone through the thorough study and testing required to show that they are effective and safe in humans,"" said Skyler Johnson, a radiation oncology professor at the University of Utah’s Huntsman Cancer Institute. 
None of the available research, Johnson added, ""supports the claim that Ivermectin is an effective treatment for cancer.""

The Gates video, however, is from 2015, and he was not talking about Kenya’s digital ID program. He was discussing medical research on vaccines and genetically modified organisms in Africa. 
Although Kenya’s digital ID program, Maisha Namba, is real, it does not involve physically implanting IDs into babies at birth. 
Kenya has struggled to create a digital ID program, the Center for Financial Inclusion, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, reported in August. Under the current program, the Kenyan government assigns Kenyan citizens nine-digit digital ID numbers, physical ID cards and digital IDs, using biometrics such as fingerprints. The IDs aim to let Kenyans access online government services more easily and better track payments for government services. 
Adult Kenyans can register for the program and newborn babies are issued nine-digit ID numbers at birth. None of the public reporting about the program says it involves implanting babies with physical devices.

Gates’ quote was taken from a 2015 interview with Euractiv, a Brussels news site focused on European policies, about the charitable work he and his then-wife, Melinda Gates, were conducting through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. 
The interviewer asked about the safety of genetically modified organisms in African agriculture. Gates compared genetically modified organism safety with research on vaccine safety. He said genetically modified organisms should not be banned outright. But he also said there should be trials and safety measures to ensure the organisms are safe, as there are for vaccines and medicines.
""The strongest analogy is to medicines, and, is there something to worry about with medicines, that is, might some of them have side effects?"" Gates said. ""Do we need safety testing? And we’re taking things that are genetically modified organisms and we’re injecting them in little kids arms, we just shoot them right into the vein. So, yeah, I think maybe we should have a safety system where we do trials and test things out.""

stated on November 19, 2024 in a public event:","We’ve created 732,000 jobs since I've been governor.","stated on November 19, 2024 in a public event:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/dec/26/kathy-hochul/job-growth-on-hochuls-watch-helped-by-pandemic-rec/,,"Gov. Hochul returned to her Buffalo roots when she recently cited steady job growth on her watch.
""I grew up in a tough neighborhood,"" Hochul told business leaders at an event hosted by the Partnership for New York City and Crain’s New York Business. ""You know, I've come from the streets of Buffalo and Lackawanna Steel Plant, and Dad worked in a steel plant. My parents lived in a trailer park. So, I've seen how tough it is out there. I know what people are going through, because people that my parents lived next door to still live in that same trailer park years later, the families. People have not escaped, and my job is to help them by creating more jobs with all of you. We've created 732,000 jobs since I've been governor.""
Is Hochul right? Have 732,000 jobs have been created since she became governor in late summer 2021?
Hochul’s staff told us they determined that 732,000 new jobs have been created by comparing private sector job data, which is seasonally adjusted, from August 2021, the month that Hochul was sworn in, with data from July 2024. In August 2021, there were 7,669,100 private sector jobs in New York state. In July 2024, there were 8,401,500 jobs. That's a difference of 732,400 jobs. These figures are available from the state Labor Department and are collected through a survey of payrolls in cooperation with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Hochul’s staff told PolitiFact the July data she relied upon to make her claim was ""current at the time of the event."" But Hochul spoke Nov. 19, and datasets from August, September and October were available. When asked about the newer data, the governor’s staff said that her figure represents a picture of the governor’s first full three years in office.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
Seasonally adjusted data shows that private sector jobs have fallen consistently, if modestly, since July. In August, the number of jobs fell by 8,100 from July. In September, the number of jobs fell again by 2,900. And in October, they fell by 800. The October data was released five days before Hochul’s statement.
Comparing the data from the month when she took office, August 2021, with the most recent data available, preliminary data from October 2024, when private sector jobs totaled 8,391,200, the result is an increase of 722,100 jobs, or nearly 10,000 fewer than she claimed.
Although that is a lower figure, the difference represents 0.1% of the state’s private sector employment. That could be covered by the data’s margin of error.
The survey data for the Current Employment Statistics program counts people who are employed during any part of their pay period on the 12th of every month, and this data set reflects the most up-to-date information when Hochul took office Aug. 24, 2021. The data does not include independent contractors.
Another way to look at the job figures is to take all of the nonfarm jobs, not just private sector jobs. (Farm jobs are not counted in this data set because their numbers can be volatile, depending on the weather and other factors.) From August 2021 to October 2024, nonfarm jobs, seasonally adjusted, increased by 784,500. (In October there were 9,871,100 jobs and in August 2021 there were 9,086,600.)
Seasonally adjusted data can typically provide a better comparison between different months from different years, Bureau of Labor Statistics economist Bruce Bergman said.
A governor has debatable influence over the economy and job creation, especially after a global pandemic. Hochul took office as New York and the nation were recovering from deep job losses because of the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and growth was trending upward.
""You’ll see that big upswing in the data,"" said Scott Laing, clinical assistant professor of finance at the School of Management at the University at Buffalo. The month-to-month changes are flatter now, he said.

New York ranks 11th among states in job growth from August 2021 to September 2024, according to Laing’s analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Nevada and Texas topped the list.
Hochul prefaced her remarks by talking about a troubled economy in western New York, but the recovery between July 2019 and July 2024 happened downstate, according to an analysis of nonseasonally adjusted data by E.J. McMahon, an adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute and a longtime conservative observer of state economics.
""All of the state’s job recovery, and then some, has been concentrated in New York City,"" McMahon said. ""And upstate, as of July, still had not recovered to its July 2019 level."" 
Our ruling
  Hochul ignored the latest monthly jobs reports when she said 732,000 jobs had been created during her administration. Accounting for the three more recent reports shows a slightly smaller increase of 722,000 jobs.
But that difference is minimal given the total number of private sector jobs, and falls within the data’s margin of error.
When counting all nonfarm jobs — not just private sector jobs — the job growth exceeded her statement, with 784,500 new jobs between August 2021 and October 2024.

stated on December 18, 2024 in an X post:",Government shutdowns in 2013 and 2018 “cost our economy billions of dollars each.”,"stated on December 18, 2024 in an X post:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/dec/19/sara-jacobs/fact-check-past-government-shutdowns-cost-billions/,,"As Congress headed toward a potential pre-Christmas shutdown, some lawmakers warned that closing the government would not save taxpayer money.
Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-Calif., criticized a push for mass cuts in federal spending by the Department of Government Efficiency, an incoming presidential advisory committee run by entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. Musk urged lawmakers to vote against a 1,500-plus page ""continuing resolution"" that would keep the government open. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., had negotiated the plan with House Democrats, whose votes he needed to pass it.
Ramaswamy described the bill as ""full of excessive spending"" and said it ""should fail."" President-elect Donald Trump and JD Vance, the vice president-elect, rejected the spending deal that would fund the government through mid-March.
""Maybe someone should tell DOGE that government shutdowns aren’t efficient or cost effective?"" Jacobs wrote Dec. 18 on X, using the committee’s self-chosen abbreviation. ""The 2013 and 2018 ones (again led by House Republicans) cost our economy billions of dollars each.""
In a video, Jacobs added that a government shutdown wouldn’t hurt Musk and Trump, both billionaires, as it would ""everyday Americans.""
Government analyses and outside experts say Jacobs has a point that shutdowns can cost the economy, often measured in gross domestic product, billions of dollars. (Gross domestic product is the total monetary value of all goods and services a country produces.)
""Typically there is a shifting of activity across time and an overall loss of GDP in the single digit billions,"" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a center-right think tank. He cautioned, however, that even a shutdown that costs billions of dollars is modest in the context of a $27 trillion-plus U.S. economy. 
How much have past shutdowns cost?
Congress has until late Dec. 20 to pass a bill that President Joe Biden would sign before 12:01 a.m. Dec. 21 to avoid a shutdown.
Workers across the country would feel a shutdown’s effects. About 85% of federal workers are based outside the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area.
Shutdowns vary in scope and length, and calculating the cost of any particular shutdown is complicated. But government and private analysts have previously estimated that shutdowns hurt the economy.
""Government shutdowns decrease government spending, so these goods and services cannot be provided, directly decreasing output,"" the Congressional Research Service wrote in 2023. 
Shutdowns primarily affect discretionary spending, which accounts for about 27% of total federal spending. Shutdowns do not generally affect mandatory spending, such as Social Security, Medicare and interest payments on the national debt.
Shutdowns also have indirect economic effects, notably federal workers reducing their own spending because they aren’t receiving their paychecks. Although federal workers are paid retroactively, a cash crunch at Christmastime could dampen retail sales and complicate travel.
Steve Ellis, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan group that tracks the federal budget, told PolitiFact, ""Everyone agrees that shutdowns hurt the economy and taxpayers.""
He cautioned, however, that a hit in one quarter can be partially made up in a later quarter. 
""The federal government is going to spend that money, the work is going to get done,"" Ellis said. But he added that ""it won’t be as efficient, so shutdowns are always a waste of money and time.""
A Jacobs spokesperson pointed to several data points, including a Congressional Budget Office estimate that the five-week partial government shutdown in 2018-19 reduced economic output by $11 billion during the following two quarters, including $3 billion that the U.S. economy never regained.
Jacobs’ office also cited a government report that said the cost of pay for furloughed workers was $2 billion. Moody’s Analytics said the 16-day full-government shutdown in October 2013 reduced U.S. GDP growth by $20 billion. 
Another examination of the 2013 shutdown, by the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, found:

120,000 fewer private-sector jobs created in October’s first half.

Stalled approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that delayed sending products to market.
In 2013, Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi said the shutdown stunted fourth-quarter GDP growth by 0.5 percentage points, resulting in a $20 billion hit to the economy. Standard & Poor's found a similar lost amount.
When Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said in 2014, ""It cost us more to shut the government down than to keep it open,"" we rated his statement True. With Republicans poised to control Congress, Paul has a different take, expressing support for Musk and criticizing Johnson. 
Our ruling
Jacobs said government shutdowns in 2013 and 2018 ""cost our economy billions of dollars each.""
Independent estimates by government offices and private-sector economic analysts concluded that the 2013 full-government shutdown and the 2018-19 partial shutdown cost the U.S. multiple billions of dollars.

As we’ve reported, the ivermectin debate has persisted since the pandemic started, but there’s no conclusive evidence that the drug effectively treats COVID-19.
The FDA has approved ivermectin’s use in treating humans with certain parasitic infections, such as pediculosis caused by head or body lice, or skin conditions, such as rosacea. The agency urges people to take the drug only as prescribed by a health care provider.
A large clinical trial published in 2022 in the New England Journal of Medicine found that ivermectin did not decrease either hospitalizations or prolonged emergency room stays among COVID-19 patients.

A new one we saw: That the drones may be part of an intensive search for missing radioactive material.
A Dec. 16 Instagram post cited a report filed with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission about radioactive material that was ""lost in transit"" Dec. 2 in New Jersey.
""Could this be the reason for all of the mysterious ‘drones’ that have been seen flying around NJ air space?"" the post asked.

We found other social media posts making claims connecting the report to the drone sightings. One Instagram post said, ""Military drones are sniffing for spill site.""
The claims also spread among lawmakers. A group of Staten Island, New York, elected officials wrote a letter to the Department of Homeland Security asking whether there was a connection between the drones and the missing material report. New Jersey’s Belleville Mayor Michael Melham also speculated in a local TV interview that the two events might be linked.
The Instagram posts were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.) 
We contacted the Department of Homeland Security for comment and received no immediate response. But our reporting found that these social media posts heightened fear by ignoring key facts about missing radioactive material and mysterious drones.
(Screenshot from Instagram)
New Jersey drone sightings began Nov. 18, two weeks before a small amount of radioactive material was reported missing in the state. New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection spokesperson Caryn Shinske said the missing material was found Dec. 10. That’s several days before social media posts appeared saying that the drones were looking for it.
A Nuclear Regulatory Commision report, shared in some of the social media posts, said New Jersey’s Nazha Cancer Center had reported that ""a Ge-68 pin source that they sent for disposal has been lost in transit"" Dec. 2. ""The source is a Eckert & Ziegler model HEGL-0132, with current approximate activity of 0.267 mCi. The shipping container arrived at its destination damaged and empty,"" the report said.
The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection reported the incident to the commission as required by federal law.
The report said the missing item contained a ""less than Cat 3 level of radioactive material,"" which it defined as ""very unlikely to cause permanent injury to individuals or contain a very small amount of radioactive material that would not cause any permanent injury.""
The Ge-68 pin source is a small piece of radioisotope used to calibrate positron emission tomography (known as PET) scanners, and to generate isotopes used in nuclear medicine diagnostic studies, Shinske said.
PET scans generate 3D images and can detect early signs of cancer and heart and brain conditions, the Cleveland Clinic said.
The pin source contains ""a very low-level radiation source that is approved for shipping through common carriers like FedEx,"" Shinske said.

""The radioactive source — about 6 inches in length and with a 1.5-millimeter diameter — has been located, repackaged, and sent to the manufacturer from the FedEx shipping facility where it was misplaced,"" Shinske wrote in a Dec. 17 email to PolitiFact. No drones were used in the search, she said.
When the state is notified of a lost or stolen radioactive source, the department’s Radiation Protection Element staff communicates with the carrier, FedEx, ""until the material is recovered,"" Shinske said. 
In an ABC News interview, Dr. James Dalzell, a radiation oncologist at the Nazha Cancer Center, also said the missing material had been found and delivered to the manufacturer for disposal. Dalzell said the item’s radiation level was low and that safe shipping required only plastic foam packing.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesperson Neil Sheehan said ""the level of radioactivity associated with the (Ge-68 pin) source is considered relatively low, but it is nonetheless kept shielded when not in use for the protection of workers and the public.""
A Dec. 18 agency update shows the missing pin source was found and the incident was closed.
A spokesperson for the National Nuclear Security Administration, part of the U.S. Energy Department, told PolitiFact in an email that its Nuclear Emergency Support team does not use drones for nuclear or radiological detection missions, and is not currently conducting aerial operations in the New Jersey region.
Drone sightings have caused concern among residents and some legislators, but White House National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby said Dec. 16 that the New Jersey drone sightings are a combination of lawful commercial, hobbyist and law enforcement drones and fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters and even stars mistaken for drones. Kirby’s comments were echoed in a Dec. 17 joint statement by the Department of Homeland Security, FBI, Federal Aviation Administration and the Defense Department.
""We have not identified anything anomalous or any national security or public safety risk over the civilian airspace in New Jersey or other states in the Northeast,"" Kirby said. He did not mention drones being used to search for missing radioactive materials.
Our ruling
Social media posts said a federal agency report about missing radioactive material in New Jersey explains the mysterious drones spotted in the Northeast in recent weeks.
But the drone sightings began two weeks before a small amount of radioactive material went missing. And the material had been found several days before the social media posts were published.

Since mid-November, people have spotted unidentified drones flying over New Jersey, prompting news stories and an FBI investigation. 
Senior FBI officials told lawmakers Dec. 10 that the agency is ""actively investigating"" the New Jersey drones, but they said the FBI does not know who is responsible or if the drones pose a threat to public safety or national security. The Pentagon said the drones are not of foreign origin.
With little information available, social media posts on the topic have ranged in tone from curious to alarmed. 
""So, what the hell is going on with the drones over New Jersey?"" asked a Threads user in one Dec. 11 post that included images. ""Huge swarms of them, coming in from over the water, flying around with seemingly no purpose."" 
It continued, saying that the drones tailed U.S. Coast Guard ships and triggered a congressional inquiry. It added that people had ""spotted and recorded"" five to six similar drones over Colorado’s Boulder County.

The post also included two purported photos of the drones. One image showing a large collection of dotted, colorful lights hovering in the sky above a body of water, with a skyline in the distance. The other, which had a different skyline in the distance, showed a cluster of orange-yellow lights that were arranged into a sort of jagged line and also hovering above the water. 
This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)

Reverse-image search results show that neither of the images in the Threads post show the New Jersey drones that recently captured people’s imagination and sparked concern about foreign intelligence gathering.

The TikTok user tagged the video’s location as Starbase, the name of Space X’s rocket assembly and launch site in south Texas. (On Dec. 12, billionaire Elon Musk, Space X’s CEO, requested an election to make Starbase an incorporated city in Texas.)
News reports show that SpaceX sponsored a Dec. 7 holiday drone show. The reports said the show featured 600 drones that flew over Isla Blanca Park on South Padre Island, Texas. The show lasted about 13 minutes, according to videos. 
The exact origin of the Threads post’s second image is less clear, but it didn’t show drones reported in New Jersey. We know this because the reports of drone flyovers in New Jersey began Nov. 18, and a reverse-image search of the photo turned up identical results from much earlier than that. 
For example, we found a more vibrant and slightly less zoomed in version of the same image in a YouTube video posted in April 2020. In Spanish, that video purported to show ""Extraterrestrial spaceships in New York,"" with the caption asking: ""What is happening in New York??"" 
Another reverse-image search revealed these photos were first shared online as early as 2019, also well before the buzz about any New Jersey drones. Similar photos of a turquoise blue skyline at night were linked to a 2018 electrical fire after transformer explosions in Queens, New York City, but we didn’t find photo or video matching this exact skyline — either with or without the yellow-orange lights in the upper right hand corner. 
Our ruling
A Threads post purported to show photos of the mysterious drones that have been reported flying over parts of New Jersey in November and December 2024. 
Reverse-image search results show that neither of the images showed New Jersey drones: The first showed drones from a Dec. 7 holiday drone show in Texas and the second has been circulating online since at least 2019 — years before the first reports of unidentified drones flying in New Jersey.

The same text was posted Dec. 6 on X. But there’s no proof that Thompson was scheduled to testify against Pelosi. The representative is not being investigated for insider trading, based on searches of news reports, the Nexis news database and court records.
Pelosi’s spokesperson declined to comment.
Stock trading by members of Congress is governed by the Stock Act, which requires members of Congress to report sales, purchases or exchanges of securities exceeding $1,000 30 days after being made aware of them, or no later than 45 days after the transactions. Congress members who are late to report their trades incur a $200 fee, and repeated delays could lead to more fees.
Pelosi’s husband, Paul, is an investor; her staff has repeatedly said she owns no stock. Nancy Pelosi’s 2024 periodic transaction reports show only transactions by her spouse.
President-elect Donald Trump in September claimed Paul Pelosi traded Visa stock before an antitrust lawsuit was announced and said Nancy Pelosi ""should be prosecuted for that."" But the government hasn’t said it’s investigated Pelosi’s trading activities.

Thompson was facing insider trading allegations. A lawsuit accused him of selling stock before news broke about a federal investigation into UnitedHealthcare, The Washington Post reported.
Other social media users pointed to a periodic transaction report by Nancy Pelosi showing that her spouse on Feb. 12 and 21 bought call options for Palo Alto Networks Inc., which UnitedHealth Group, UnitedHealthcare’s parent, tapped to assess a Feb. 21 cyberattack on its unit Change Healthcare. (Call options are contracts that let buyers buy stocks at specific prices within specific times.)
Victims of the cyberbreach sued Change Healthcare, and the health care compliance news site The HIPAA Journal reported that settlement talks were scheduled for early December.

Another Facebook post shared the same headline. These posts were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)
The headline comes from a Dec. 4 article published by The People’s Voice, a website known for spreading misinformation. We’ve repeatedly fact-checked the site’s false headlines, and the byline on this article, Baxter Dmitry, is often on misinformation sites.
The article does not provide evidence to support the claim. The article described Powers’ appearances on Fox News and her health complications.
Powers’ mother, Joan Powers, told The New York Times on Dec. 4 that her daughter’s cause of death was brain cancer. Powers, who was a podiatric surgeon, was diagnosed in July 2020 with glioblastoma, an aggressive brain cancer.
The first COVID-19 vaccines were not publicly available in the U.S. until December 2020, months after Powers’ diagnosis.
The term ""turbo cancer"" was popularized by antivaccine activists, who’ve repeatedly claimed — contrary to available evidence — that COVID-19 vaccines cause unusually aggressive, fast-growing cancer.

Powers had a yearslong history of health problems. In the January issue of Preferred Health magazine, Powers described how in 2018 she started to have chest pain and shortness of breath.
""I went into heart failure while doing a report on Fox Business — live — on heart health and talking about the subtle signs that women often miss,"" Powers told the magazine. ""I was actually diagnosed with heart disease by accident when my gallbladder was failing and I had to have it removed.""
Powers said when she went to the hospital to have gallbladder surgery, doctors examined her heart and discovered she had pericardial effusion, or fluid around her heart. She said in a May 2020 Fox News interview that she had emergency surgery to address this.
Then, on July 11, 2020, Powers posted on Instagram that she was diagnosed with a brain tumor. In the years following, Powers had three brain surgeries and multiple rounds of radiation, chemotherapy and immunotherapy, her family wrote on a GoFundMe page for her treatment. But in February, Powers posted on Instagram that her cancer had returned and another mass was found in her brain.
We found no credible news reports attributing Powers’ cancer diagnosis or death to the COVID-19 vaccine.

In January 1973, Beau and Hunter were still recovering from their injuries at a Wilmington, Delaware, hospital when it was time for Joe Biden to be sworn in to the Senate. Joe Biden asked the Senate for permission to take his oath of office at the hospital, rather than the U.S. Capitol, so he could remain with his children.
Reporters and photographers documented the Jan. 5, 1975, ceremony. The Associated Press took the photo seen in the Facebook post, and the caption says the child pictured was Beau Biden, not Hunter. Getty Images also photographed the scene and identified the child as Beau.

Now a viral claim about one of his landmark policies on electric vehicle charging says it has yielded only a handful of stations.
""Pete Buttigieg will leave his post as Transportation Secretary having spent $7.5 BILLION to build 8 EV charging stations,""  U.S. Rep. Michael Rulli, R-Ohio, wrote Nov. 24 on X. ""His legacy will be squandering billions on something nobody wants, while millions struggle to afford the things we need.""
Donald Trump Jr. shared Rulli’s X post and added: ""Does not seem like a great return on investment.""
We saw a similar claim on Facebook. ""Joe Biden’s administration invested $7.5 billion into EV charging stations, but somehow only built 7 or 8 stations in about 2 years, and now people want to know where all the money went,"" a Nov. 29 Facebook post featuring a photo of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said.

This claim is inaccurate. More than eight charging stations have been built and several hundred are still under construction by state and local governments.
Rulli’s office did not respond to our request for comment.
The $7.5 billion figure refers to funding for expanded electric vehicle charging from the 2021 bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The law gave $5 billion for EV charging under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program and $2.5 billion under the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure grant program. The federal government distributes National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure funds to transportation departments in all 50 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia; a wide range of agencies, including municipal governments, tribal governments and universities, can access Charging and Fueling Infrastructure funds. 
A U.S. Federal Highway Administration spokesperson told PolitiFact the two federal programs have so far funded 37 charging stations. Like gas stations, EV charging stations can have multiple charging points.
Of the 37 federally funded stations built in 13 states, there are 226 charging ports, said Rachael Dussuau, the Federal Highway Administration’s associate public affairs administrator. As of Dec. 3, Dussuau said there are projects underway for 24,800 federally funded charging ports.

She told PolitiFact in an email that the recent Facebook claim is ""not true"" and that states have not spent all of the $7.5 billion from the infrastructure law.
To get money from the 2021 law, states and agencies must submit plans to an office run jointly by the Energy and Transportation departments. The Federal Highway Administration approves the plans; state and local jurisdictions oversee construction.
The federally funded EV charging program started slowly. Although the infrastructure law passed in November 2021, the Energy Department said initial state plans were not approved until September 2022. Constructing an EV charging station also requires site selection, permitting, collaborating with utility companies and other aspects of construction.
The Facebook claim likely comes from a March Washington Post report that found the program’s slow rollout meant only seven charging stations had been completed. During his speech at the Republican National Convention, President-elect Donald Trump falsely claimed the Biden administration spent $9 billion on eight chargers.Buttigieg responded to Trump Jr.’s post on X, saying, ""In this program, the chargers are built by the states, not the federal government. And while it takes time to get a novel multi-billion dollar program going across 50 states, the states are on track.""

We also found no news reports that a supposed new owner wants to cancel ""The View.""
The 2023 satirical article was published after Disney CEO Bob Iger signaled that Disney was open to selling some of its television assets. Byron Allen, founder and CEO of Allen Media Group, offered Disney $10 billion for ABC but received no public response from Disney. 
Reuters reported Sept. 15, 2023, that a ""Disney spokesperson said while the company was ‘open to considering strategic options for its linear business,’ it has not made a decision yet on selling ABC or any other property.""
If someone had purchased ABC, several news outlets would have reported it. In 1995, Disney’s multibillion-dollar deal to buy then-Capital Cities/ABC drew attention from both news organizations and the U.S. Justice Department over potential antitrust concerns.
This is not the first time we have fact-checked claims of ABC’s sale. PolitiFact rated False a similar claim that X owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk fired the entire cast of ""The View"" after acquiring ABC.

This claim isn’t true. The World Health Organization officially declared smallpox wiped out in 1980 after years of no new reported cases.

In the United States, there have been no natural cases of smallpox since 1949, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The last reported case of smallpox in the world was recorded in Somalia in 1977.
The smallpox vaccine was the key driver in eliminating the disease, but since the virus’s elimination, the vaccine plays no role in keeping smallpox eradicated. The smallpox vaccine does, however, protect against the mpox virus.

Ireland’s Department of Rural and Community Development in June 2023 launched an Our Living Islands initiative. 
Department of Rural and Community Development spokesperson Céimin Burke said ""no payments are being offered to encourage people to move to any of Ireland’s islands.""
Burke said, ""Rather than encouraging relocation, the aim of the Our Living Islands policy is to reverse the trend of depopulation on offshore islands by supporting vibrant and sustainable island communities."" 
The initiative aims to do that with investments in infrastructure, essential services and housing on remote islands, which are cut off from Ireland’s mainland by the tide.
A grant program in the initiative seems to have caused confusion about Ireland paying people to move there. Ireland doesn’t pay anyone to move to an island, but it does offer Vacant Property Refurbishment Grants for people who renovate vacant and derelict property and then live there or offer the homes as long-term rentals.

That grant program existed before the Our Living Islands initiative and is used throughout Ireland. Under the plan, an additional 20% above typical grant ceilings is available because of home construction’s increased costs on outlying islands, Burke said. The maximum grant under the island program is 84,000 euros, which is about $88,000 U.S. dollars. The money must be used only for renovation.
The grant program to refurbish vacant homes is open to foreign nationals, but it provides no assistance to move there. 
""Our Living Islands does not include any proposals or schemes to facilitate immigration or resettlement to Ireland’s offshore islands, and therefore the residency requirements are the same as the rest of Ireland,"" Burke said.
Ireland’s residency requirements allow people to move to Ireland if they make financial investments in the country, or to retire there if they can prove they are financially independent.
A Facebook post claimed ""Ireland will pay you $90,000 to move to a beautiful island home,"" but it misleads on what the country offers.

In the year since Rittenhouse’s acquittal, multiple false claims have surfaced saying he has sued some talk shows and hosts for defamation. One  — fictitious lawsuit he was said to have filed was against ""The View,"" Goldberg and co-host Joy Behar in 2021. 
Now the claims have gone a bit farther, saying that because he won a lawsuit against Goldberg and she didn’t pay Rittenhouse for the supposed settlement, he has put a lien against her Malibu, California, home. 
We found that although Goldberg once owned a home in Malibu, she sold it in 2002. She bought a home in New Jersey.
A lien is a legal right to a debtor’s property that is typically used as a collateral when the debtor doesn’t pay a settlement or loan. If the person doesn’t pay, the creditor can seize the property. Liens can also be established through court judgments as a result of a lawsuit and by government entities, according to Investopedia.

The U.S. McDonald’s website does not name ""silicone oil"" as an ingredient in the chicken nuggets. The website lists the following ingredients, and silicone oil (or a related chemical name, ""dimethylpolysiloxane"") isn’t among them:
White boneless chicken, water, vegetable oil (canola oil, corn oil, soybean oil, hydrogenated soybean oil), enriched flour (bleached wheat flour, niacin, reduced iron, thiamine mononitrate, riboflavin, folic acid), bleached wheat flour, yellow corn flour, vegetable starch (modified corn, wheat, rice, pea, corn), salt, leavening (baking soda, sodium aluminum phosphate, sodium acid pyrophosphate, calcium lactate, monocalcium phosphate), spices, yeast extract, lemon juice solids, dextrose, natural flavors.
PolitiFact contacted McDonald’s about this claim and received no reply by the time of publication. 
In our research, we learned that U.S. McDonald’s chicken nuggets once contained dimethylpolysiloxane, an antifoaming agent derived from silicone. It is found in a variety of foods, such as cooking oil, vinegar and chocolate. It’s also added to oil to prevent it from bubbling up when frozen ingredients are added.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approves dimethylpolysiloxane as a food additive. The Code of Federal Regulations Title 21, as of November 2024, says that dimethylpolysiloxane can be added to food not to exceed 1 part per million.
But in 2016, McDonald’s USA announced the removal of artificial preservatives from several menu items, including Chicken McNuggets. Since then, dimethylpolysiloxane has not been in the nuggets’ ingredients. 
The U.S. has more than 13,000 McDonald’s restaurants, by the far the most of any country as of 2023, according to Statista, a German data gathering site. Japan and China are the other countries with the most restaurants, but we could not find complete ingredient lists for their McNuggets.
We also didn’t find silicone oil or dimethylpolysiloxane in the United Kingdom’s and India’s Chicken McNuggets. However, dimethylpolysiloxane is on the ingredient list in Canada’s McNuggets.
This is not the first time we have fact-checked claims about McDonald’s food. In September, we rated a video that claimed the FBI found human remains at a McDonald’s meat supplier Pants on Fire!
McDonald’s Chicken McNuggets in the U.S. — the country with the most McDonald’s locations — no longer contain silicone oil, though it is still listed on the ingredients list in at least Canada. We rate the claim Mostly False.

Musk dijo en diciembre de 2023 que ""Disney tiene un gran problema de contenido"". En febrero, describió las normas de inclusión de la compañía como ""racismo y sexismo institucionalizados"", y en julio, dijo que un ""virus mental ‘woke’"" controla Disney.
Pero no encontramos evidencia en su cuenta que corrobore las afirmaciones de que está bloqueando el contenido del Orgullo de Disney en X. 
Tampoco encontramos fuentes creíbles, como noticias o declaraciones públicas de Musk o Disney, que lo confirmen.

También encontramos una publicación similar en inglés en Facebook de SpaceX Fanclub, una cuenta que sólo publica sátiras. 
""Contenido de Orgullo bloqueado en X permanentemente, 'proteger a los niños es lo primero'"", decía la publicación. Esta enlazaba a una entrada de blog, también etiquetada como ""sátira"", que citaba supuestas publicaciones en X de Musk y del actor Elliot Page. No encontramos tales publicaciones en la cuenta de ninguno de los dos.  
El 15 de noviembre, la publicación de entretenimiento y juegos, Polygon, informó que Disney había retirado un episodio de una serie de animación llamada ""Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur"" que incluía una historia sobre una atleta transgénero.
Los artistas que trabajaron en el programa culparon a la reciente elección del presidente electo Donald Trump, pero Polygon informó que una fuente anónima de Disney dijo que la compañía decidió hace más de un año retener el episodio.

""BREAKING: the U.S Senate accidentally passed a bill banning Trump from Becoming President, and (President Joe) Biden is planning to sign it,"" a Nov. 19 Threads post said.
The Threads post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)
The words and image in the Threads post originated in a Nov. 19 X post from PoliticsVideoChannel, a self-described news and media company, whose X profile says, ""Facts matter!""
We agree that facts matter and, in this case, the Threads post had not one fact right.

That X post had more than 1 million views by Nov. 20. In a long thread about the bill, it said it referred to the Ending Trading and Holdings in Congressional Stocks Act, or ETHICS Act for short, and linked to a July 24 news release from Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev.
But neither the Senate or U.S. House has passed the bill, so there is nothing for Biden to sign. And the bill would not prevent Trump from serving as president.
(Screenshot from Threads)
The bill would immediately bar members of Congress, the president and the vice president from buying and selling securities, commodities, futures, options, trusts and other comparable holdings, a Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Senate Committee summary said.
Beginning March 31, 2027, those elected officials — and their spouses and dependent children — will have 120 days to divest from those assets.
The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs on July 24 voted 8-4 to approve a revamped version of S.1171, a bill Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., introduced in April. Merkley, fellow Democrats Gary Peters, D-Mich., and Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., and Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., announced agreement on the revamped legislation July 10. 
The bill has not come up for a vote in the full Senate. The House has not taken action on the original bill.

A Merkley spokesperson told PolitiFact in an email that the proposed law would not ""ban"" Trump from becoming president, but would require him to change his financial holdings to be in compliance.
Trump is the largest shareholder in Truth Social, his social media company, and said he has no intention to sell his stock in the company. But nothing in the bill’s language would prevent Trump — or any Congress member — from serving for breaching the law. Instead, there are financial penalties.
If the bill became law, violators would have to forfeit their monthly salaries or pay 10% of the value of each asset, whichever is greater, the bill’s summary said. It would also raise penalties in the 2012 STOCK Act for failure to report holdings from $200 to $500 per violation.
A U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs spokesperson also said individuals would face fines until they comply with the divestment requirements of the law, if it's passed. The Office of Government Ethics would have to assess Trump's assets case by case, the spokesperson said.
Our ruling
A Threads post said, ""The U.S Senate accidentally passed a bill banning Trump from becoming President, and Biden is planning to sign it."" The X post the claim originated from referred to the Ending Trading and Holdings in Congressional Stocks Act. 
But nothing in that bill would keep Trump from being president. It advanced from a Senate committee and has not been scheduled for a full Senate vote. If the Senate and the House pass the measure and the president signs it into law, it would prevent members of Congress, the president and vice president from buying, selling and owning stocks. Violators would face financial penalties, but they would not be barred from office.

As of Nov. 19, about 16,400 votes separated Republican Dave McCormick from incumbent Sen. Bob Casey, according to CNN. The Associated Press called the race for McCormick on Nov. 7, but Casey has not conceded. The race is within the 0.5% margin that triggers an automatic recount by state law.
The counties must begin the recount by Nov. 20. Some counties have already started tabulating the 7 million paper ballots that will be recounted. 
X owner Elon Musk, who leveraged his massive wealth this year to campaign for President-elect Donald Trump and Republicans in Pennsylvania and elsewhere, accused Casey of trying to count the votes of noncitizens, who are legally barred from voting. 
""The Democratic Party senate candidate in Pennsylvania is trying to change the outcome of the election by counting NON-CITIZEN votes, which is illegal,"" Musk wrote Nov. 13 on X. 
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
This claim lacks evidence. 
The Casey and McCormick campaigns have sparred over the validity of an estimated 60,000 provisional ballots across Pennsylvania’s 67 counties. Provisional ballots are cast when voters’ eligibility to vote is in question — records may show that these people already voted, or are not registered in the correct county, or are not registered to vote at all. 
After the election, county officials verify whether provisional ballots are valid. Ballots deemed valid are included in the final vote count; invalid ballots are thrown out. Campaigns can challenge decisions to accept or reject those ballots. 
This process happens in every election in nearly every state. 
The Casey and McCormick campaigns have disagreed about whether to count provisional ballots. But so far, the citizenship of voters who cast provisional ballots isn’t in question. 
PolitiFact reviewed public ballot hearings in Pennsylvania and examined local reporting on provisional ballot challenges. We found no instances of ballots being rejected because someone wasn’t a citizen, or because Casey’s campaign had asked officials to count known noncitizens’ votes. Local outlets reporting on Musk’s claim called it false.
X’s press team did not respond to our query about Musk’s claim.
McCormick’s campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment. McCormick’s campaign manager, Matt Gruda, has accused Casey’s campaign of trying to count unregistered voters, but neither Gruda nor the campaign has said publicly that noncitizens were voting.
Challenging the validity of ballots
Casey’s campaign has broadly called for election officials to count as many provisional ballots as possible. That includes ballots missing poll workers’ signatures, voter information or secrecy envelopes. 
Casey’s campaign also challenged the rejection of batches of ballots in counties in which voters’ names could not be found on the counties’ voter registration lists. The campaign asked officials to recheck the registration lists and said the ballots of voters with pending registrations should be accepted. 
In many cases, the Casey campaign later reviewed those ballots and presented officials with ballots it believed had been mislabeled as coming from people who weren’t registered to vote.
A Casey campaign lawyer, in a letter to Lackawanna County’s solicitor, said ballots should be accepted if the voters who cast them were registered in a different county but moved to and voted in a new county within the last 30 days. The attorney also said voters with pending registration statuses should be allowed to vote if their registration applications were valid, and added that counties should follow federal law when removing voters from voter rolls. 
Gruda, McCormick’s campaign manager, has called these efforts an attempt to count the votes of people who are not registered to vote. He said in a Nov. 13 X post that Casey is ""trying to illegally count UNREGISTERED voters as a way to cut into (McCormick’s) margin.""
Gruda’s post is in the chain of X posts on which Musk commented, although the campaign did not mention noncitizens.

Casey’s campaign has denied calling for nonregistered voters’ ballots to be counted, and said it is asking officials not to reject votes from voters who are registered. 
""No one is trying to count votes from individuals who were not registered,"" Casey campaign lawyer Adam Bonin said. ""This is categorically false.""
McCormick’s campaign has asked that ballots be rejected if the voters’ names aren’t on voter rolls. County officials have generally voted to throw those ballots out; some have said they will verify the status of voters Democrats identified as being registered. 
In videos of provisional ballot hearings reviewed by PolitiFact, in Philadelphia and Allegheny, Lancaster and Montgomery counties, the issue of noncitizens casting ballots did not come up. And the letter from Casey’s campaign listing the reasons it asked for ballots to be counted did not include any reference to noncitizens. 
James Allen, Delaware County’s elections director, said there was no dispute about noncitizen voters when the county reviewed provisional ballots. 
""We had hundreds and hundreds of challenges but we haven’t had one person say, ‘Ah, look at this, a group of noncitizens,’"" Allen said. 
Allen said Musk, and other people who claimed noncitizens are voting, have not provided evidence that noncitizens voted in Pennsylvania. 
The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Seth Bluestein, a Republican commissioner in Philadelphia, said he did not see challenges in the city that were based on noncitizen voters. Pittsburgh radio station WESA-FM reported that Lackawanna County Solicitor Donald Frederickson Jr. said noncitizen voters were not an issue in his county, either.
Our ruling
Musk said Casey is ""trying to change the outcome of the election by counting NON-CITIZEN votes, which is illegal.""
The U.S. Senate candidates in Pennsylvania are dueling over whether provisional ballots in counties across the state are valid. In many cases, Casey’s campaign has challenged the rejection of ballots from voters who were not found on the counties’ voter rolls. 
But Casey’s campaign has not asked for noncitizen votes to be counted. In the county meetings PolitiFact reviewed, noncitizen votes were not at issue. McCormick’s campaign has also not claimed Casey is trying to count noncitizen votes.

That McDonald’s uses seed oil and not beef tallow to make its french fries is not a revelation Kennedy exposed. McDonald’s — along with fast-food competitors Burger King and Wendy’s — made the switch from beef tallow in 1990 amid national concerns about saturated fat in Americans’ diets.
McDonald’s website said the company uses a canola-blend oil to fry potatoes at its restaurants, and said its cut potato suppliers partially fry them first in an oil blend that contains beef flavoring.
Kennedy argues that seed oils such as canola oil are causing an obesity epidemic.
The New York Times reported that experts said research of seed oils shows the opposite, and that they are much healthier than using animal fat.

Helene hit western North Carolina on Sept. 27, causing record flooding in the state’s mountainous areas. The storm killed at least 100 people in North Carolina and displaced hundreds more. 
In a Nov. 12 X post, an account called ""The Disrespected Trucker"" posted a TikTok video by a man who calls himself ""Appalachian Prepper."" In the video, the man says authorities planned to take custody over children whose parents had not found a place to live.
""Red Cross is set to close shelters across North Carolina on November 15th. Families staying in these shelters are being told: ‘If you don’t have a safe place to take your children, you won’t be leaving with them. The authorities will keep them,’"" a man says in the video.

PolitiFact North Carolina contacted the man in the TikTok video using the email he included in the video. He said his goal was to help families that need shelter. He did not provide evidence proving that officials — either within the Red Cross or within the government — were threatening to keep children whose parents didn’t have a place to stay when a shelter closed. his claim. 
Government entities and their partners are often the target of misinformation following natural disasters such as Helene, and PolitiFact North Carolina has fact-checked multiple misleading claims since the storm hit. Among them: the false claims that federal agencies tried to seize land and resources in western North Carolina.
Likewise, this video features claims that are inaccurate.
Red Cross shelters
First, the American Red Cross is not planning to close its western North Carolina shelters on Nov. 15 — because the humanitarian nonprofit organization has already closed all of its shelters in that region, a Red Cross spokesperson said.
""As of (Nov.) 12th, the Red Cross was no longer managing any shelters in Western North Carolina,"" Stephanie Fox, a spokesperson for the group, told PolitiFact in an email.
On Nov. 9 and Nov. 10, the Red Cross transferred management of its last remaining shelter to Western Carolina Rescue Ministries, Fox said. That shelter, at the Gold’s Gym in Asheville, will remain open through at least Dec. 31, Fox said.
Closing shelters is also a sign that Helene victims have successfully found shelter, Fox said.
""Less shelters being open means residents have been able to secure — whether on their own, through our support, or through the support of other partners — viable housing solutions,"" she said. ""Those who still face barriers to securing housing solutions remain at the facility being managed by the Western Carolina Rescue Ministries while they, the Red Cross, and other partners continue to work with them to identify the many ways we can help with transitioning to a new normal.""
Not keeping children
The Red Cross doesn’t take custody of children, Fox said. ""We do not serve in any role that involves separating children from their families,"" she said.
There’s also no state-driven effort to assume custody of any Helene victim’s children, said Hannah Jones, a North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson. The accusation that social service departments are threatening to remove children from their parents is false, Jones said. 
Legal Aid, a nonprofit law firm providing free legal services to victims of Helene in western North Carolina, hadn’t received any concerns about those victims losing custody of their children, said Jonathan Perry, Legal Aid’s western regional manager.

""I was in the Asheville area Red Cross facilities for seven days, spoke with hundreds of people and many Red Cross Officials,"" Perry told PolitiFact. ""Not once did this question arise in those shelters nor the other mountain shelters we visited. I have not heard one report of this on the ground.""
State law allows North Carolinians to file a Child Protective Services report if they believe a child’s lack of shelter could lead to maltreatment, Jones said. However, Legal Aid experts said removing children from their parents typically requires an investigation and approval from the courts. 
In cases in which families have lost their homes to natural disasters, such as Helene, county government officials would try to find shelter for the whole family so it could remain together, said Jones, the health department spokesperson.
To support that effort, state lawmakers recently approved disaster relief bills that included millions of dollars for local county governments in disaster-affected areas. Government and community agencies have the resources to help families find shelters, housing programs and rental assistance, Jones said. 
""When local departments of social services respond to (child welfare reports), efforts would be made to assist the family in locating a safe place to live so that the family could remain together,"" Jones said. ""Child Welfare Services’ priority is to preserve families when this can safely occur.""
Our ruling
A man in a social media video says the Red Cross ""is set to close shelters across North Carolina on Nov. 15. Families staying in these shelters are being told: ‘If you don’t have a safe place to take your children, you won’t be leaving with them. The authorities will keep them.’"" 
The American Red Cross has already closed the shelters it manages and rebutted the claims in the video. The nonprofit says it’s not involved in taking custody of children, and independent lawyers helping families in western North Carolina say they haven’t heard of this happening.
North Carolina’s Department of Health and Human Services also called the claim false, saying state lawmakers distributed money to local governments specifically to help families find shelter.

"Nancy Pelosi
stated on November 9, 2024 in an interview:",“Fewer people came in under President Biden than came under Donald Trump.”,"stated on November 9, 2024 in an interview:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/nov/15/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosis-wrong-comparison-about-illegal-immig/,,"In a New York Times interview about the 2024 election, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the Democrats lost partly because of cultural issues. Journalist Lulu Garcia-Navarro, co-host of ""The Interview,"" pointed out that most voters said they voted on inflation, the economy and immigration. 
""Those aren’t cultural issues,"" Garcia-Navarro said. ""Those are policy issues.""
Pelosi countered, ""When the candidate for president is saying that these people coming in are murderers, rapists, thieves and all the rest of that. He made that a cultural issue.""
Garcia-Navarro said millions of people crossed the U.S. border under President Joe Biden’s administration. Pelosi said, ""I don’t think we were clear enough by saying fewer people came in under President Biden than came under Donald Trump.""
Illegal immigration under Biden has dropped significantly in the past four months, reaching levels lower than President-elect Donald Trump’s last few months in office. But it’s wrong to say illegal immigration, which reached historic highs under Biden, is lower overall than it was during Trump’s first term.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
Pelosi’s office did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment, but illegal immigration data contradict Pelosi’s claim. A Pelosi aide told The Washington Post that Pelosi was referring to deportation data. That data shows that Biden’s administration repatriated more people than Trump did, but that’s not what Pelosi said in the interview.
What the data on illegal migration shows 
From February 2021, Biden’s first full month in office, to September 2024, the latest month with data, U.S. Border Patrol agents encountered migrants trying to illegally cross U.S. borders between ports of entry 7.2 million times.
Under Trump’s administration, from February 2017 to January 2021, Border Patrol encountered immigrants between ports of entry 1.8 million times. 
The encounters data does not represent how many people were let into the U.S; there’s no specific data for that. But according to federal data, Customs and Border Protection released about 313,000 people under Trump’s administration and about 3.6 million people under Biden’s administration, to await court hearings. (Biden’s data includes people given humanitarian parole, a legal authorization to live and work in the U.S. for up to two years.)
Based on the available data, fewer people did not come to the U.S. under Biden than under Trump, as Pelosi claimed. But there are important caveats about the data to consider.
The pandemic changed data tracking: Before March 2020, border data tracked the times people were apprehended crossing the border illegally under immigration law. During the pandemic, the Trump and Biden administrations apprehended people under that law. But officials also began tracking expulsions under a public health policy, Title 42. People expelled under this policy were not let into the country; whereas people apprehended under immigration law in some cases could still be let in.
Starting in fiscal year 2020, U.S. Customs and Border Protection began reporting encounters, a combination of apprehensions and Title 42 expulsions. (Title 42 enforcement ended in May 2023.) 
So, the change in immigration data tracking makes it hard to fairly compare entries across different administrations.
Encounters represent events not people: Not everyone encountered is let into the country. Immigration data represents events, not people. If one person tries to enter the country three times and is stopped each time by border officials, for example, that equals three encounters, even if it’s the same person encountered. People expelled under Title 42 were not penalized for repeat attempted entries, so many tried coming in multiple times.
In recent months, encounters have drastically dropped: In June, Biden issued a policy limiting people’s ability to apply for asylum at the southwest border. Since then, Border Patrol encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border have dropped sharply, from more than 117,000 in May to fewer than 54,000 in September. 
From July to September, monthly Border Patrol encounter counts have been below the counts during Trump’s last four months in office.
Despite the data caveats and the drop in encounters in the past few months, Pelosi’s claim that fewer people came into the U.S. under Biden than under Trump is inaccurate.
What the deportation data shows
As with encounters data, comparing prepandemic deportation data to deportation data during the public health emergency is challenging. There are multiple ways people can be repatriated — sent back to their home country or another country that will accept them. 
Removals: This is when people are sent out of the U.S. via an official court order, often penalized for the illegal entry. This can include people who have lived in the United States for years and people who recently arrived. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is usually involved.
FEATURED FACT-CHECK
Donald Trump
stated on January 20, 2025 in remarks
The United States is the only country with unrestricted birthright citizenship.
By Samantha Putterman • January 21, 2025
Returns: This happens at the border when people are returned to their home countries without legal penalties and without being placed in formal removal proceedings. 
Title 42 expulsions: These happened from March 2020 to May 2023 under the public health policy. Many people arriving at the border were not let into the United States and were expelled without legal penalties.
When combining the data for all these types of repatriations, Biden has sent out more people than Trump did (4.3 million compared with 2.2 million.)
But when looking only at Immigration and Customs Enforcement data, Trump removed more people than Biden did (about 294,000 compared with about 114,000.)
We asked immigration experts whether more encounters under Biden factored in the higher number of total repatriations under his administration. They said only partly, because despite the rise in illegal immigration encounters, the resources available for deportations have remained largely the same.
""The government has a finite capacity to identify, detain, and remove individuals, so it is not as if removals capacity can be dramatically scaled up or down based on a changing encounters picture,"" Michelle Mittelstadt, the nonpartisan think tank Migration Policy Institute’s communications director, told PolitiFact in September.
The rise in encounters influenced the decrease in Immigration and Customs Enforcement removals. Biden focused on repatriating people at the U.S. border, rather than deporting people who have been living in the U.S. for decades. Biden also had more total repatriations because he executed quick public health expulsions that didn’t require court orders much longer than Trump did. 
Also, under Biden, many more immigrants came from countries other than Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras than under Trump. It is harder to deport migrants from those other countries for ""legal and logistical reasons,"" a Migration Policy Institute report said.
Our ruling
Pelosi said, ""Fewer people came in under President Biden than came under Donald Trump."" 
Under Biden, Border Patrol agents encountered migrants trying to enter the U.S.7.2 million times; under Trump, officials encountered migrants 1.8 million times. Encounters don’t mean people were let in, and there’s no data for how many people who were encountered are now living in the U.S. But the numbers of people released to await court hearings don’t corroborate Pelosi’s statement, either. There were about 313,000 under Trump compared with 3.6 million under Biden.
Pelosi’s team didn’t respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment. But it told The Washington Post that Pelosi was talking about deportation data.
Overall, Biden has carried out more total repatriations — sending people out of the U.S. — than Trump. But that’s not evidence that fewer people were let into the U.S. than under Trump.

Forty-one states and Washington, D.C., permit a losing candidate, a voter, a group of voters, or other concerned parties to petition for a recount, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Biden voted in Delaware, which allows any candidate for statewide office in a general election to apply to the court for a recount if the margin is less than 1,000 votes or less than 0.5% of all votes cast for two candidates — whichever amount is less, the National Conference of State Legislatures says.

Although Trump has not yet announced his education secretary nominee, several news organizations have written that Oklahoma State Superintendent Ryan Walters’ name has been floated as a potential choice. A group of parents of Oklahoma public school students, teachers and ministers sued Walters and the Oklahoma Department of Education over a mandate that public schools incorporate the Bible in their curricula. The lawsuit argued that $3 million in state funds was designated for buying Bibles, with a Trump-endorsed Bible being one of the few that would meet the purchasing specifications.
Whomever Trump chooses as his education secretary will not be immediately appointed to the role. Per the Constitution, the Senate must approve most of Trump’s presidential Cabinet, including his education secretary.

Tammy Baldwin. 
A week after Election Day, Hovde posted a five-minute video to his X account with his thoughts on the race.
""I believe it’s better not to comment until I have the facts,"" he said in the video’s first few seconds. ""Like many of my supporters, I was shocked by what unfolded on election night."" 
Hovde also said that at 4 a.m. Milwaukee updated its count to include roughly 108,000 absentee ballots and that Baldwin won ""nearly 90% of those ballots.""
""Statistically, this outcome seems improbable,"" Hovde said, ""as it didn’t match the pattern from same-day voting in Milwaukee, where I received 22% of the vote.""  
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
Let’s see if Hovde is correct. 
Baldwin received 80.9% of absentee vote
  Absentee ballots are just a portion of the total votes in any election. But since Hovde is focused on absentee ballots, it’s fairly easy to see his claim is incorrect by going to the city of Milwaukee’s election results page. It should be noted that some absentee voters chose third-party candidates for U.S. senate or skipped that race.
Milwaukee received 108,964 absentee ballots by Nov. 5, according to the unofficial count. 
Of that group, Baldwin received 88,229 and Hovde received 17,699 absentee ballots. 
So, Baldwin got 80.9% of the absentee vote and Hovde got 16.2% of it. 
Clearly, Baldwin did not get ""nearly 90%"" of the absentee ballot vote.
In comparison, Baldwin slightly outperformed Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris who received 87,852 absentee votes, or 80.6%. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump outperformed Hovde by receiving 18,698 or 17.1%. 
That pattern occurred throughout the state as Baldwin outperformed Harris and Hovde was not carried by Trump who ended up winning the state. 
Hovde received 21.1% on Election Day
Hovde is claiming the absentee ballot pattern doesn’t match what he got on Election Day. So, let’s review what happened in Milwaukee on Election Day. 
On Election Day itself, there were 140,043 votes cast in Milwaukee, according to the unofficial count. Of that number, Baldwin received 102,598 and Hovde received 29,574.

By Sara Swann • January 17, 2025
So, Baldwin pulled down 73.2% of the vote on Election Day compared to Hovde’s 21.1% of that vote. That’s not quite 22%, as he said, but it’s closer than what he said Baldwin’s absentee vote was.
Often, the same-day vote comes in at a different split than absentee votes because, traditionally, more Republicans vote on Election Day than earlier. And Republicans this year pushed for more of their supporters to vote absentee. 
And the vote being counted early Wednesday morning shouldn’t have surprised Hovde, either. 
Under Wisconsin law, absentee ballots cannot be processed before 7 a.m. on Election Day. The Republican-controlled state Senate earlier this year let a bipartisan bill die that would have enabled clerks to start processing absentee ballots the day before the election and therefore finish counting all the ballots at a more reasonable time on Election Day. And thus avoiding updating the results at 4 a.m.
Our ruling
In suggesting there may be irregularities with the vote count, Hovde claimed Baldwin got ""nearly 90%"" of the absentee ballot vote in the city of Milwaukee. 
According to the city’s results on its website, Baldwin got 80.9% of the vote, which is not ""nearly 90%.""

These claims are inaccurate. Wisconsin election experts told PolitiFact that this early morning influx of ballots was expected — and they not only don’t signal anything nefarious, they resulted from adherence to the law. That’s because state law does not allow election workers to process absentee ballots before Election Day — despite a bipartisan push to change that law earlier this year.
The claims echo falsehoods about the 2020 election, which included the same criticisms of Milwaukee’s early-morning absentee ballot influxes.
""This is something that everybody who’s familiar with elections in Wisconsin understands will happen,"" said Jay Heck, executive director of the public advocacy group Common Cause Wisconsin.
Wisconsin is one of two swing states — and one of seven states total — that does not begin to process absentee ballots before Election Day, he said. 
The 4 a.m. influx of absentee ballots was ""only indicative"" of that, said Claire Woodall, a senior adviser at Issue One, a group advocating for transparency and clean government. 
""The ‘influx’ in the results was reflective of the number of absentee ballots that the City of Milwaukee tabulated and were known to still be outstanding at 8 p.m. on Election Night,"" she said. 
Woodall, who served as the City of Milwaukee’s Election Commission executive director from 2020 to 2024, wrote in an email that ""results from Milwaukee’s Central Count have come in between 12 a.m. and 4 a.m. every Presidential Election due to the restrictive state laws.""
Milwaukee Central Count’s high speed tabulators also do not report ""partial reports,"" so the results of the ballots counted there are ""delivered in one fell swoop,"" Woodall said.
""All results must be exported onto encrypted flash drives and hand-delivered to Milwaukee County,"" Woodall said. ""This process cannot be completed until 100% of the absentee votes have been tabulated."" 
As Milwaukee absentee ballots were tabulated Nov. 5, someone noticed that doors on the tabulator machines were not fully secured. After consulting with Republican and Democratic officials, the Milwaukee Election Commission said it would restart tabulation at central count to be ""fully transparent"" and ""to eliminate any doubt."" 
Ann Jacobs, chair of the Wisconsin Elections Commission, said in a series of Nov. 5 X posts that the tabulator machines were zeroed out and the previously tabulated ballots — about 34,000 ballots — would be rerun through the machines.

When mistakes happen, officials should ""acknowledge them, fix them"" and explain them, she wrote, adding: ""So sorry my friends, it will be a very late night here in beautiful Milwaukee."" 
A Milwaukee Election Commission statement said the city had ""no doubt regarding the integrity of the election."" As of Nov. 11, the commission’s updated statement said Milwaukee’s Board of Election Commissioners had certified the general election results. 
After Hovde mentioned Milwaukee’s 4 a.m. election results, city election officials rebutted his claims in a Nov. 11 Instagram post. 
""It is both expected and routine that absentee ballots — over 100,000 in this case — are counted and reported in the late hours of Election Night due to Wisconsin’s high voter turnout and the rigorous verification standards the MEC upholds,"" the Election Commission wrote. ""Unlike states led by both Republicans and Democrats that permit absentee ballots to be processed ahead of Election Day, Wisconsin does not, which can result in the reporting of large numbers of absentee ballots late at night."" 
The Milwaukee Election Commission called Hovde’s claims ""baseless"" and said it was ""fully confident"" that his claims lacked merit. 
Our ruling
Instagram posts claimed a 4 a.m. ""ballot dump"" in Milwaukee showed the Wisconsin U.S. Senate election was stolen from the Republican candidate.
In Wisconsin, election officials can’t process absentee ballots early, so experts say it is routine for an influx of absentee ballot votes to be reported late at night or in the early morning hours after Election Day. Because of an error noticed during tabulation, Milwaukee also tabulated more than 30,000 ballots, further delaying the city’s election results. 
Election experts rebutted claims that the 4 a.m. influx of results signaled election fraud or malfeasance.

At a Nov. 4 rally in North Carolina, Trump threatened to impose tariffs of 25% to 100% on Mexican imports if it didn’t stop the ""onslaught of criminals and drugs coming into our country."" Two days after Trump’s win, Nissan — which, like other major automakers, produces some of its vehicles in Mexico — announced it planned to cut jobs and reduce global production.
""Nissan just announced 9000 layoffs in Tennessee to avoid severe losses due to expected tariffs. Experts expect more,"" a Nov. 13 Threads post said.
This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.)
On Nov. 7, Nissan did announce 9,000 job cuts, but they’re not due to potential tariffs. 
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
""The announcement last week of a potential global headcount reduction had nothing to do with any proposed actions by the incoming administration,"" Nissan U.S. Corporate Communications Director Kyle Bazemore told PolitiFact in an email.
(Screenshot from Threads)
The company announced the layoffs when reporting first-half financial results for fiscal year 2024. A news release said to reduce costs by $2.6 billion, ""Nissan will cut global production capacity by 20% and reduce its global workforce by 9,000.""
The move comes after Nissan saw a drop in net revenue of 79.1 billion yen, or about $509 million. The company called it a ""severe situation"" and said CEO Makoto Uchida will take a 50% pay cut, in addition to the job and production cuts.
Nissan has been struggling, in part, because it doesn’t have an offering in the surging U.S. gasoline-electric hybrid market, Uchida said. 
The news release did not mention possible tariffs as a factor, nor did company executives attribute them to tariffs in a Nov. 7 news conference. 
Uchida did respond to a question about the effect of possible Trump-imposed tariffs. ""Not only us, but many carmakers are using Mexican production, so we would like to do a lot of lobbying efforts,"" he said. He said the company exported 300,000 models from Mexico to the U.S. this fiscal year and that the company would ""monitor carefully"" what is happening with tariffs.
Nikkei, a Japan-based financial news outlet, reported that Japanese automakers are preparing to spend more on lobbying in the U.S. with Trump in charge. Nissan, Honda and Toyota together spent 25% more on lobbying in Trump’s first term, compared with former President Barack Obama’s last term.
William Reinsch, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ economics program, said a massive layoff would be premature because Trump hasn’t taken office and tariffs have not taken effect.
""Trump has proven himself unpredictable, so it is hard to say what he might actually do once in office, but I don’t think it’s realistic to assume Nissan initiated a layoff that size purely on speculation about possible tariffs,"" Reinsch said.

Neither the news release nor Nissan executives have specified where the 9,000 cuts to global headcount would come from.
Bazemore also did not specify if the layoffs would affect workers in Tennessee, home to Nissan’s North American headquarters. Nissan has two production sites in the state. A Smyrna plant makes the Nissan Maxima, Leaf, Pathfinder, Rogue, Murano and the Infiniti QX60, Nissan’s website said. Another plant in Decherd produces engine parts.
Bazemore said the U.S. is a priority market for Nissan, and ""we expect an increase in sales from all-new models, including the Nissan Kicks, Murano, Armada and Infiniti QX80.""
While Nissan’s Murano is produced in Tennessee, the Kicks subcompact SUV is manufactured in Mexico, and the Armada and QX80 are produced in Japan. 
Nissan also makes the Sentra and Versa in Mexico, where it produced more than 615,000 light vehicles in 2023. It exported about 367,000 of those that year.
Our ruling
A Threads post claimed Nissan is planning 9,000 layoffs in Tennessee because of Trump’s proposed tariffs. 
A company spokesperson said the layoffs and production cuts announced two days after the U.S. election are not related to possible Trump policy. The company is cutting costs after a severe sales slump. It’s unclear where the job cuts would be made, but the company described them as global and not specific to Tennessee.
We rate the claim False.

(And for the third presidential contest in a row, Wisconsin played a crucial role.) 
As analysts unpack these results in the coming days and weeks, expect to see them mull over why President Joe Biden was able to beat Trump in 2020, but Harris couldn’t match his numbers. 
In Wisconsin, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester — who easily won reelection himself — suggested during a Nov. 6  news conference that it’s because Democrats nationally have taken key voting blocs for granted, and many of those voters this time chose Trump. 
Exit polls and numbers show he may be right on that, but then he went too far, claiming, based on what he’d seen on television, that ""every single county in America, every single county, Kamala Harris did worse than Joe Biden did."" 
That might have been accurate at some point as results trickled in on election night, but it sure didn’t stay that way.

Let’s break it down. 
Harris outperformed Biden in six Wisconsin counties 
Vos’ office didn’t respond to a request for the evidence he used to make his claim. 
It might have been a little tedious to identify where Harris outperformed or matched Biden across all of America’s 3,000-plus counties. For time’s sake, we’ll look just at Wisconsin. 
There were six counties across the Badger State where Harris’ share of the vote this year was greater than Biden’s share of the vote in 2020, and two more in which their share of the vote was the same. Those include: 
Brown County, where both Harris and Biden received 45.5% of the vote 
Door County, where Harris received 50.6% of the vote to Biden’s 49.9% 
Eau Claire County, where Harris received 54.5% of the vote to Biden’s 54.3%
Manitowoc County, where Harris received 37.6% of the vote to Biden’s 37.5%

Washington County, where Harris received 31.2% of the vote to Biden’s 30.2%
Waukesha County, where Harris received 39.3% of the vote to Biden’s 38.8% 
There were some counties where Harris received more raw votes than Biden did in 2020, but a lower share of the vote total. That may have happened because of votes for third-party candidates, or because the county population grew in the last four years — such as in Dane County, in which Harris received almost 14,000 more votes than Biden, but captured 75.1% of the vote to Biden’s 75.7%.
As such, we’ll keep this analysis to counties where Harris’ vote share outperformed or matched Biden’s. 
And while she only did so in eight out of Wisconsin’s 72 counties, that proves wrong Vos’ assertion that she did worse than Biden in ""every single county in America."" 
There are also other examples across the country — according to a Nov. 6 New York Times analysis, nationally, about 10% of counties had shifted more Democratic since 2020. (Some Western states were still counting votes then, too.)

Vos claimed that ""every single county in America, every single county, Kamala Harris did worse than Joe Biden did."" 
An analysis of the 2020 and 2024 election results in Wisconsin alone shows he’s wrong — Harris received a greater share of the vote than Biden did in six of 72 counties, and matched his share of the vote in two others.

The video in the Threads post was clipped from an episode of Fox News’ Nov. 6 episode of ""Outnumbered,"" in which Spunt reported the day after the election that Fox News was told that ""Jack Smith will be gone from his post as special counsel, meaning the cases will be gone, before Trump takes the oath of office at noon on Jan. 20th.""
Trump had said he’d fire Smith ""within two seconds"" of his return to the White House.
Smith filed a motion Nov. 8 to suspend the remaining deadlines in the federal case against Trump for charges related to the 2020 election, ""to afford the Government time to assess this unprecedented circumstance and determine the appropriate course going forward consistent with Department of Justice policy.""
U.S. District Court Judge Tanya S. Chutkan granted the motion.

When asked whether Smith had submitted his resignation, Justice Department spokesperson Peter Carr on Nov. 12 referred PolitiFact to that filing, which he said ""provides the latest information on the status of the case and the Special Counsel."" The document bore Smith’s name and title as special counsel. On Nov. 13, Carr confirmed nothing had changed.
Smith has until Dec. 2 to file a report showing how the government intends to proceed with the case. It was put on hold after the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity ruling, which means Chutkan must decide which elements of the case can be prosecuted.
U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon in July dismissed the federal case related to charges that Trump mishandled classified documents after ruling that Smith’s appointment violated the U.S. Constitution. Smith appealed that decision.
Trump was earlier convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records; the sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 26. Trump also faces charges in a Georgia case related to the 2020 election results, but it is halted on a Trump team appeal that seeks to disqualify the top prosecutor, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis.

Let’s cut to the chase: Trump alone won in states that have strict voter ID requirements, as defined by the National Conference of State Legislatures, but he also won in states with looser laws. And claims that Harris exclusively won states without voter ID requirements flatten the nuances of the voter ID debate, ignoring state and federal laws to verify voters’ identity before they can vote in person or mail a ballot.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
Voter ID laws across the country
Voter ID laws across the country are not one-size-fits-all. 
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 36 states request or require voters to show some form of ID at the polls. The remaining 14 states and Washington, D.C., require no form of identification to vote at the polls but use other methods to verify voters’ identities, such as matching voters’ signatures or asking voters for personal information. And federal law requires first-time voters to show ID when requesting mail ballots, while some states have additional ID requirements for voters mailing in ballots.
As we’ve reported, among the 36 states that do request or require some form of identification to vote in person, the laws vary widely as to whether they are strictly applied or whether a photo ID or another form of identification is accepted.
Ten of those states have strict photo ID laws. Voters who lack acceptable photo IDs must vote a provisional ballot and take additional steps to verify their identity after Election Day for their ballot to be counted. 
Three of those states accept other forms of identification. In Arizona, for example, a recent utility bill or bank statement is acceptable as ID. 
In the other 23 states, voters without acceptable identification can cast a regular ballot without having to act further after Election Day. That means a voter without proper identification may sign an affidavit or poll workers may vouch for a voter’s identity.
As for mail ballots, states have different laws and procedures for verifying the identity of voters who don’t vote in person. In 22 states, voters applying for a mail ballot must show ID, provide an ID number, such as from a driver’s license, or obtain a witness or notary signature, according to the Voting Rights Lab, an organization tracking state election laws and proposed legislation. In 21 other states, voters requesting mail ballots must verify their identity using personal information, such as date of birth. The remaining seven states and Washington, D.C., have universal mail voting, so ballots are automatically sent to voters ahead of every election, without voters needing to request them.
Election officials in every state use signature verification to validate the identities of voters who cast mail ballots, the National Vote at Home Institute said.
Comparing states Harris, Trump won and voter ID laws
Next, let’s compare the states Harris and Trump won with their voter identification laws. 
Harris won: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, , New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island,  Vermont, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. and Washington state.
Some of the states Harris won don’t require documents to vote. Oregon, for example, mails a ballot to registered voters before Election Day, but it verifies voters’ identities when they register using an acceptable form of identification including a driver’s license, valid photo ID or Social Security number. 
But other states Harris won do ask for identification: Washington, Colorado, Connecticut. Delaware, New Hampshire and Rhode Island.
In Washington state, identification is requested but the state holds all elections by mail, ""so this provision impacts few voters,"" the National Conference of State Legislatures said. Colorado similarly holds elections by mail and requests ID, so its law affects in-person Election Day voters.
Photo ID is requested in Rhode Island, according to the group, and if voters don’t have one, they must vote on a provisional ballot and then election officials match their signatures against the signatures on record. 
Photo ID isn’t required in Connecticut, but identification is requested. If it’s not presented, voters must give their name, date of birth and address and sign under penalty of making a false statement.
In New Hampshire, a voter without identification must sign a challenged voter affidavit. After the election, a mailing is sent and the voter must sign and return it or risk a voter fraud investigation. 
The National Conference of State Legislatures slots states into five categories in its analysis of voter ID laws across the country: strict photo ID, strict non-photo ID, photo ID requested, ID requested; photo not required, and no document required to vote. 
Trump alone won states with strict voter ID laws, but he also won states in which photo ID and non-photo ID are requested, and two states in which no documents are required.

Although efforts to tighten identification requirements for voting have been underway for about two decades, they accelerated after the 2020 election, when Republican lawmakers sympathetic to Trump’s false claims of voter fraud pushed for tighter voter ID requirements to combat fraud. So, it’s unsurprising that states that have stricter laws voted for the Republican presidential candidate. 
National experts, meanwhile, have said such fraud is isolated and rare. Democrats and voting rights advocates have criticized some state voter ID laws, particularly ones with narrow lists of acceptable types of ID, as overly burdensome. 
Our ruling
The Instagram post said, ""Every state that does not require voter ID, Kamala won.""
It’s not true that only Trump won states with voter ID laws while Harris won every state without. 
Trump won the nine states that the National Conference of State Legislatures says have strict photo ID laws, and he won the three states the group says have strict non-photo ID laws.
He also won 11 of the states in which photo ID is requested; Harris won one such state. 
Trump and Harris each won six states in which some form of identification is requested.
And Trump won two of the states the conference classifies as not requiring documents to vote; Harris won 12 such states. 
But these classifications are shorthand for a variety of voter ID requirements and verifications process across the country, including verifying voters’ identities when they register to vote in states in which they automatically receive a mail ballot. Social media posts lumping Harris with states that purportedly don’t require identification and Trump with those that do lose that nuance.

In the Threads video, Rubio said, ""Thank you to Heritage for inviting us here, giving us an opportunity, and for all the scholarship that they do here. That really serves as a guidepost for a lot of the public policy we choose to make.""
He did not mention Project 2025, nor did he in the full video of the April 15, 2015, event, at which Rubio joined fellow Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, to discuss tax reform. 
Rubio could not have mentioned Project 2025 in 2015 because the plan wasn’t published until April 2023. The video also shows a ""Road to the White House 2016"" logo. (Two days earlier, Rubio had announced his own presidential run, which he would later end in March 2016 after Trump beat him in the Florida Republican primary.) 
Vice President Kamala Harris and Democrats similarly tried to make Project 2025 a major campaign issue and tried to tie it to Trump.
Trump sought to distance himself from Project 2025 during the campaign, calling some parts of the plan ""ridiculous."" The New York Times reported that about 175 former Trump administration officials and advisers helped write the plan, and some of its policy proposals, such as eliminating the Education Department, mirror Trump’s.

Trump so far has named Tom Homan, formerly his acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement director, as his ""border czar."" Homan, a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation, is listed as one of dozens of Project 2025 contributors.
A CBS News analysis of Project 2025 found more than 700 specific policy proposals. Its review found that at least 270 matched Trump’s past policies or recent campaign promises.
Project 2025 calls for extensive overhauls in the executive branch and draws on long-held conservative principles, such as tax cuts that Trump has agreed with or may agree with. Trump, on his own, published a less specific agenda during his 2024 presidential campaign.
When asked about Project 2025 in a July CNN interview, Rubio said he likes the Heritage Foundation and some things it stands for. But he described Project 2025 as a think tank’s work, not as something speaking for Trump.
There may be some overlap between Project 2025 and the policies Trump will seek to enact, but the claim that this 2015 video shows Rubio ""admitting"" that Trump will lean heavily on the plan is False.

That’s what social media posts claim the CEO of online real estate marketplace Zillow, said during a recent interview. 
""BREAKING: Zillow CEO just said on CNBC Trump's deportation plan will help with housing affordability,"" reads an X post by conservative commentator Ryan Fournier that was reshared Nov. 8 on Instagram.
The post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.)
Zillow CEO Jeremy Wacksman appeared on CNBC, but he didn’t say President-elect Donald Trump’s mass deportation plan would help make housing more affordable.

In a Nov. 7 interview on CNBC’s ""Squawk on the Street,"" Wacksman spoke about Zillow’s revenue growth amid a sluggish housing market.

Co-host Sara Eisen turned to Trump’s deportation plan, asking Wacksman, ""What President Trump had said about it is that, a lot of it, the affordability problems is due to illegal immigration and that after he carries out the ‘largest deportation operation in history’ that will ease prices by reducing demand. Do you agree? Are you optimistic that that can help?""

Wacksman said the real estate market has a supply-and-demand imbalance and that the country is chronically underbuilt. He did not say whether he thought Trump’s plan would make housing more or less affordable, or whether immigrants were driving a significant source of demand. 
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
Here is what he said:
Wacksman: ""The big challenges in the real estate market are affordability and availability. Those are the two structural problems we have to work on. Affordability, as we talked about, is around what has happened with home prices and inventory. And inventory is our biggest challenge. We are missing listings, listings are up a little bit from last year, but if you look back to prepandemic levels, we’re down sharply and we are chronically underbuilt as a country. And so bringing new inventory, new-home starts online is going to be one of the things that really helps the supply-demand imbalance.""
Eisen: ""But have immigrants been a big source of demand for that and lack of availability?""

Wacksman: ""We’ve seen demand across all segments. The buyer demand is there. Any time rates move a little bit you see demand spike on sites like Zillow. The pent-up demand, the desire to buy, is always there. Again, the challenge for buyers is affordability and what they can buy. And so the structural challenges and changes we need to make as a country are really around affordability and availability of supply.""
In an emailed statement, Zillow told PolitiFact the primary driver of housing affordability issues continues to be a lack of supply influenced by ""years of underbuilding and restrictive zoning rules.""

Housing and real estate experts have said Trump’s plan could exacerbate home prices, primarily because of the hit the construction industry would take.
""Sending immigrants back, as Trump has proposed, risks doing serious damage to the supply side of housing,"" said Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh, a real estate and finance professor at Columbia  Business School. ""About a quarter of construction workers are immigrants; in some places like California, the share is even higher. Some trades like roofing, masonry, and drywall installation are highly reliant on immigrant labor. There are persistent labor shortages in plumbing and electrical work that immigrants help mitigate."" 
Construction Dive, an online site covering the building industry, cited a 2021 study showing that migrants in the U.S. illegally comprise about 23% of the construction labor force.

By Samantha Putterman • January 21, 2025
Nieuwerburgh said research has shown that tighter border control results in higher construction costs and lower housing affordability, adding that stimulating the entry of new businesses and  workers into the construction industry is what’s needed to help alleviate the housing strain.

Other research has pointed to regulatory red tape as a major culprit behind the low inventory. In some states, such as California, the combination of rules, regulations, permits, approval processes and fees dramatically increases construction timelines, making it costlier to build and pushing supply further behind.

Zillow pointed to its research on housing affordability and its proposed solutions. These include policies that allow for new construction and standards that address regulatory restrictions at the local, regional, state and federal levels that would require a reexamination of zoning, financial, permitting and development practices.

In an October interview with NPR, Chloe East, an associate economics professor at the University of Colorado, Denver, who studies immigration’s effect on U.S.-born people, said immigrants may play a small role in increasing housing prices in some areas but that there are much larger causes. 
""The main factor is a slowdown in new residential construction that has been happening since the Great Recession,"" East told NPR, mentioning the increase in restrictive zoning laws. ""High interest rates that we've seen in the last few years have been causing people not to sell their homes. There was also an increase in demand for housing during the pandemic because of an increase in remote work.""
East also said immigrants in the country illegally primarily rent their homes, partly because their legal status can limit their buying options. She said immigrants in the country illegally are also likelier to double up and live with family members or nonrelatives compared with U.S.-born households.
Our ruling
Social media posts claimed Zillow’s CEO said on CNBC that Trump's deportation plan will help with housing affordability.
Wacksman didn’t say this. In his CNBC interview, Wacksman discussed the U.S. supply-and-demand housing imbalance and said the country is ""chronically underbuilt"" and needs new inventory.
Zillow told PolitiFact its research shows the housing affordability crisis’ primary driver continues to be a lack of supply influenced by ""years of underbuilding and restrictive zoning rules."" Other housing experts and studies have reported similar findings.

""Paper ballots and hand counting never breaks down,"" the post said. 
The post also questioned the use of voting machines, saying, ""they always break down on Election Day.""

Studies have consistently shown that ballot tabulating machines — the machines that receive paper ballots and electronically count the votes — are more accurate than hand-counting in large numbers. The machines are tested for accuracy before the election, and results are audited in nearly every state. 
What’s more, most voters in the U.S. already use hand-marked paper ballots to cast their votes. 
The Diamond and Silk account didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Is hand-counting ballots reliable? 
Hand-counting paper ballots is tedious, time-consuming and prone to human error. 
A 2004 Massachusetts Institute of Technology study examined the variance in vote totals in New Hampshire recounts between hand-counting and machine tabulating. The study found that machine tabulation had a significantly lower variance between the initial count and the recount than hand-counting, meaning the machines were more accurate. 
A 2007 Rice University study tested the accuracy of hand-counting 120 ballots in two races with predetermined results. The participants accurately counted the two races 58% of the time. 
Hand-counting ballots is also expensive and time-constraining for local election officials, especially when ballots can include dozens of races. 
A 2023 study by Arizona’s Mohave County Elections Department found that hand-counting the 2024 general election results would require 245 people working 19 eight-hour days, which would cost about $521,000. Accounting for other expenses such as security guards, cameras and additional staff, the study estimated hand-counts for both the 2024 primary and general elections would cost the county $1.1 million. 
When accounting for human error, it’s wrong to say that hand-counting ""never breaks down,"" as it’s shown to be less reliable than machine counting.
Voting systems are tested stringently before they’re used in elections. Election officials use test ballots to ensure machine counts are accurate and to identify errors.

By Sara Swann • January 17, 2025
It’s an exaggeration to say voting machines ""always break down"" on Election Day, even if some counties run into errors. Each of the more than 3,000 counties in the U.S. has its own set of laws and voting systems to conduct elections, meaning errors sometimes happen. 
But voting in the 2024 election went relatively smoothly, and most counties used ballot tabulating machines problem-free.
The machine-counted results are also often verified after the election through audits. Every state but Alabama conducts some type of postelection audit, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Most often, this involves hand-counting a small percentage of the ballots to compare them with the machine-tabulated results. 
The post also ignores that paper ballots are widely used in U.S. elections; most U.S. voters already mark candidate preferences using paper ballots, which machine tabulators then count.
Verified Voting, a nonpartisan organization focused on election technology, said close to 70% of U.S. voters live in jurisdictions in which hand-marked paper ballots are the norm. An extra 25% use electronic ballot marking devices, in which voters mark their choices on a machine that prints a paper ballot. And 5% use direct recording electronic systems, which record selections directly into computer memory.
Our ruling
A Diamond and Silk Instagram post said ""paper ballots and hand counting never breaks down."" 
Hand-counting is prone to human error, as ballot counters can misread choices or accidentally record the wrong result. Ballot tabulating machines are tested for high accuracy and have a far lower error rate than hand-counting. 
Although there were isolated incidents of machine malfunctions during the 2024 election, the vast majority of voting systems worked as intended. 
We rate the claim False.

They say billionaire Elon Musk’s Starlink technology manipulated votes to benefit President-elect Donald Trump.
Starlink is an internet provider that uses satellites to provide connectivity; it’s a subsidiary of Musk’s commercial spaceflight company SpaceX.
""Musk’s Starlink uploaded votes in swing states,"" one Nov. 10 Threads post said. ""Swing state voters went Dem downballot but Trump at the top? Unlikely. Starlink satellites exploding, destroying evidence.""
Starlink made headlines in recent weeks when the company distributed equipment to help people regain internet access in hurricane-hit areas. To some people, that move was further proof of the conspiracy.
""The Russians have access to Starlink terminals and therefore the satellites. The Russians are known hackers,"" said another Nov. 10 Threads post. ""Elon Musk and the US gov. sent Starlink terminals to Florida, Georgia, North and South Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia due to the hurricanes.""

(Screenshots from Threads)
These posts were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)
Election security experts and state and local election officials rebutted the claims, saying the 2024 presidential election was secure and there’s no evidence of Starlink-related fraud.
""Starlink is suspected by conspiracy theorists not because of what it does, but because Elon Musk owns it,"" Mike Rothschild, a journalist, author and conspiracy theory expert, said.
This conspiracy theory circulated on Threads amid a larger wave of election denial claims from liberals that mimic Republicans’ false claims about 2020 election fraud.
""Conspiracy theories about lost elections being stolen are a natural way to cope with an unexpected outcome,"" Rothschild said, adding that it’s important to ""leave conspiracism behind and embrace reality.""
Election infrastructure is secure
Jen Easterly, director of the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, reported Nov. 6 that the agency had ""no evidence of any malicious activity that had a material impact on the security or integrity of our election infrastructure.""
Officials from swing states that received Starlink technology after the September and October hurricanes also said Starlink technology could not have been used to benefit Trump.
North Carolina’s tabulators and ballot-marking devices are never connected to the internet, Patrick Gannon, the North Carolina State Board of Elections spokesperson, said. State law prohibits connecting such equipment to the internet, he said.
""Satellite-based internet devices were not used to tabulate or upload vote counts in North Carolina,"" Gannon said. ""In addition, our tabulated results are encrypted from source to destination preventing results being modified in transit. We have no evidence of any alteration of votes by anyone.""
The other six swing states — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — have similar election security protocols to ensure voting equipment is never connected to the internet during ballot tabulation.
Even if Starlink had somehow been used to modify the vote count, there are systems designed to catch tabulation discrepancies, including risk-limiting audits, canvassing and certification of the election results, said Michael Specter, a Georgia Institute of Technology assistant professor specializing in election security.
""None of these are foolproof, but each makes it significantly less likely that an attack would be successful,"" Specter said.
Broadly speaking, voting machines are not connected to the internet, experts said. In some states, ballot tabulators are briefly connected to the internet to transmit results when polls close. And in many places, other election infrastructure, such as pollbooks with lists of digital voter registration records, have internet connectivity.
We found little evidence Starlink is widely used during elections. Even in Asheville, North Carolina’s Buncombe County, one of the places hardest hit by Hurricane Helene, election officials told PolitiFact that Starlink was not used for any election functions.
Genya Coulter, senior election analyst for the OSET Institute, a nonprofit group focused on accurate, secure and transparent elections, said she knew Starlink technology had been used to support election infrastructure in one place: Tulare County, California. Trump won Tulare County with about 60% of the vote.
""Most of the rural part of the county has little to no access to broadband, and Starlink was used to have the electronic pollbooks connected to a county voter database,"" Coulter said. Pollbooks are lists of digital voter registration records.
Vote tabulators weren’t connected to Starlink satellite internet, she said, adding that the county had about 28,000 in-person voters.
Regarding claims about Russian hackers swaying election outcomes, Coulter said she was ""less worried about Russian hackers affecting vote totals and significantly more concerned"" with the deluge of incorrect election information that Russian-linked groups distributed online before the election and the bomb threats targeting election infrastructure that officials said were ""of Russian origin.""

Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist and science data system group leader at NASA’s Chandra X-ray Center, said there’s nothing noteworthy about that.
""This is not a case of suddenly deciding to retire this satellite within the past week,"" McDowell said. ""Such reentries have been happening almost daily for the past few years, they just are at random times and random places in the world so not often over the U.S. at night where Americans can see it.""
According to U.S. Space Force data, SpaceX removed this particular satellite from operation Aug. 2, at which point the satellite started lowering its orbit, McDowell said. SpaceX abandoned the satellite Oct. 13, McDowell said.
Stargazers in the southwest United States reported seeing fireballs in the early morning hours Nov. 10. McDowell said that’s normal: During satellite reentry and breakup, observers can sometimes see fireballs moving slowly across the sky.
Why Democrats won Senate races while Trump won presidency
Some of the posts that floated the Starlink conspiracy theory pointed to Democratic successes in some down-ballot races as evidence that something was off in the Trump-Harris results. Although there’s a strong correlation between votes cast for president and senator, it’s not ironclad. Voters are free to choose candidates from different parties for different offices, and some fraction of voters do.
Ticket-splitting — when voters choose a Democrat for one office and a Republican for another — has become less common in recent election cycles as political polarization has increased. But the practice hasn’t disappeared entirely.
Incumbency can help candidates win reelection. For instance, two swing states had Democratic incumbents keep their Senate seats: Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin and Jacky Rosen in Nevada. Their achievements in office and voters’ familiarity might have helped these candidates.
Controversy, or a lack thereof, can also affect candidates’ campaigns. In Arizona, for example, Republican Kari Lake came to voters’ attention in 2022 when she lost a gubernatorial race built heavily on claims that elections are fraudulent, including the 2020 presidential race that Biden won. This year, she lost to Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, a retired U.S. Marine and a Latino, in a campaign year in which Latino voters were pivotal within the electorate.
Specter said split-ticket voting ""does not provide sufficient evidence that any malfeasance has occurred.""
Our ruling
Threads posts said Musk’s Starlink technology manipulated votes in the 2024 election to benefit Trump.
Federal and state election officials rebutted claims of 2024 election fraud, including claims that Starlink manipulated the vote counts.
Voting machines aren’t typically connected to the internet, and long-standing systems ensure votes are fairly and accurately tabulated.
We found only one instance — in California, not a swing state — of Starlink technology being used to support election infrastructure, such as having the electronic pollbooks connected to a county voter database.

"Bernie Sanders
stated on November 10, 2024 in an interview on CNN's ""State of the Union"":",Inflation-adjusted weekly wages “are lower today than they were 50 years ago.”,"stated on November 10, 2024 in an interview on CNN's ""State of the Union"":",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/nov/11/bernie-sanders/are-inflation-adjusted-wages-lower-now-than-50-yea/,,"In a Nov. 10 appearance on CNN’s ""State of the Union,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., dismissed a question from host Dana Bash about whether Democrats’ poor showing in the 2024 election came down to messaging over policy.
""It's not messaging, Dana,"" Sanders said. He said the economy has been weak for average Americans for decades.
""It has to be put into an overall context where, in the last 50 years, if you could believe it, inflation-accounted-for weekly wages are lower today than they were 50 years ago, a massive transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%,"" Sanders said.
However, this is a cherry-picked statistic. Most data shows that American wages have gained ground above the inflation rate compared with five decades ago.
The measure economists use most commonly for inflation-adjusted wages, which they call ""real wages,"" is known as median usual weekly earnings for full-time wage and salary workers, age 16 and older. If the wage in this measure is higher now than 50 years ago, then wages have kept pace with prices, or exceeded them, over that period of time. If the wage in this measure is lower than 50 years ago, wages have lagged the rise in inflation.

So, what do these ""real wage"" numbers show? They show wages outpacing inflation by a cumulative 10.7% over 50 years, beginning with their level in the first quarter 1979, which is the earliest data available. (That’s almost 46 years ago.)
It’s not a dramatic increase; it works out to wages increasing roughly two-tenths of a percent faster than inflation per year. Still, this data shows that wages have risen beyond inflation.
(Economists advise ignoring the COVID-19-era spikes in wage data; those don’t come from wage gains but from the phenomenon of lower-wage workers in industries such as hospitality being laid off during the pandemic. That left higher-wage workers, including those able to work from home, in the workforce, boosting the average or median wage.)
We also looked at another dataset maintained by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank. The group looks at inflation-adjusted wages through the lens of incomes, such as the lowest 10% of earners, the second-lowest 10%, the top 10% and the top 5%.
The Economic Policy Institute data shows that every slice of the income spectrum earned wages in 2023 above their 1973 level.
Wages in the income spectrum’s top tiers have risen faster than wages for the lowest tiers during that period. But even the lowest-paid workers’ wages beat inflation over the past 50 years.
When we asked Sanders’ office for his evidence, a spokesperson pointed to a different set of wage data: average weekly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees. This data focuses on a more blue-collar segment of the workforce. 
Sanders’ office told PolitiFact the senator is comparing now with February 1973, almost 52 years ago. Normally we wouldn’t quibble with a two-year difference, but in this case, choosing that particular date has a big impact on the comparison.
In 1971 and 1972, wages for private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees rose by 6%, an increase never matched before or since. Sanders’ calculation uses the wage peak, in February 1973. 
Dean Baker, co-founder of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, said this unusual rise in wages was attributable to then-President Richard Nixon’s policy of price controls, which involved a 90-day freeze in prices, followed by price increases that required approval by a ""Pay Board"" and a ""Price Commission.""
But starting in early 1973, when Nixon ended price controls, this same wage metric fell even more rapidly than it had risen, crashing by almost 9% over two years.
If you compare today’s wages with the February 1973 peak, as Sanders did, wages are 3.8% lower than they are today for the subset of earners that includes private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees.

But if you look back exactly 50 years before the most recent data for September 2024, then today’s wages are 2.8% higher than in September 1974.
""This really does feel like cherry-picking the data,"" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the center-right American Action Forum. ""No real result should be that sensitive to a few data points.""
Again, 2.8% is not a big increase, especially over 50 years, but it’s an increase beyond the rate of inflation, and it’s not a decline, as Sanders said.
Baker added, ""Workers definitely have not gotten their share in the last half century, but it is ridiculous to say that they have made no gains.""
Baker offered another reason for skepticism about Sanders’ statistic.
""The average work week is almost 10% shorter now than fifty years ago,"" Baker said. ""Workers have chosen to take part of their gains in more leisure (time).""
Our ruling
Sanders said inflation-adjusted weekly wages ""are lower today than they were 50 years ago.""
Two measures that economists most commonly use for inflation-adjusted wages show higher wages now compared with five decades ago.
Sanders cited a different dataset for nonsupervisory workers, showing wages lower now than in February 1973. However, that month represented an unusual high point in wages because of Nixon-era price controls. When price controls were lifted, wages plummeted.
The 50-year comparison, using September 1974 as the starting point, shows wages up by 2.8% beyond inflation.

In 2021, the Aunt Jemina brand became Pearl Milling Co., named after the original mill in 1889 that produced the brand’s self-rising pancake mix.

But Nevadans who voted by mail in this election shouldn’t panic. Ballots marked as needing signature verification weren’t being thrown out, and there’s still time to fix any ballot problems, the secretary of state’s office said.
Nevada law allows voters to ""cure"" or resolve any problems with a signature on a mail ballot return envelope, such as a missing or mismatched signature. Nevadans have until 5 p.m. PST on Nov. 12 to cure their ballots, the secretary of state’s website said.
We didn’t find that this curing process was a Republican-led effort. Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar is a Democrat.
In 2021, Democratic lawmakers in Nevada passed a law to send every active voter in the state a mail-in ballot for all future elections starting in 2022. (Nevadans can still opt-out and vote in person early or on Election Day.) This law also instructed election officials on how to verify ballot signatures and established a curing process for voters.
As of Nov. 8, the secretary of state’s website said 13,030 mail ballots, or 1.9% of all returned ballots in Nevada, needed signature cures. Of these mail ballots, 11,039 belong to voters in Clark County, the state’s most populous county. Washoe County had the next highest number, with 1,206 mail ballots needing signature cures.
Nevada election officials are contacting the voters by mail, phone and email who needed to cure their ballots. Voters can also check the secretary of state’s website themselves to see whether their ballot needs to be fixed. Once these ballots are cured, they can be counted.
Any ballots that aren’t cured will not be counted.
Clark County Registrar of Voters Lorena Portillo said during a Nov. 6 press briefing that the mail ballot signature cure process is ""very quick.""

""Once we get that phone call, the voter provides pertinent personal information that we can use to verify their identity, and then we can proceed. It doesn’t take long,"" Portillo said.
Secretary of State Aguilar expressed concerns on the morning of Election Day about young voters not having their mail ballot signatures match their driver’s license signatures. He told The New York Times that ""young people don’t have signatures these days.""
Later in the day on Nov. 5, Aguilar said in a statement that ""the need for signature cure goes beyond youth."" He said that older voters may sign their names differently throughout their lives and recently married voters may not have updated their name on their voter registration.
""Since the passage of Automatic Voter Registration, more Nevadans than ever sign their names on digital screens that may look different than their pen-to-paper signatures,"" Aguilar said.
In the 2022 general election, 5,979 ballots needing signature verification were not counted because they weren’t cured. In the 2020 general election, 2,887 ballots weren’t counted because of signature problems, according to data from the secretary of state.
Our ruling
A Threads post warned, ""In Nevada, the GOP is succeeding in throwing out the votes of thousands of young people.""
Some Nevadans’ votes will not be counted if their ballots are not ""cured"" by the deadline, but this is not because the state or the Republican Party are ""throwing out"" their votes. Nevada law requires mail-in ballots contain verified signatures; ballots with missing or mismatched signatures, therefore, will not be included in the final count.

One Nov. 7 Instagram post shared a screengrab of an X post that contained a graphic showing the partisan breakdown of wins in a number of swing states.

Trump, the graphic showed, had won or was winning the battleground states of Arizona, Michigan, Nevada,  North Carolina and Wisconsin, but Democratic Senate candidates (or in North Carolina, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate) had won or were winning their contests in those states.
""What are the odds of this happening in 5 of the swing states?"" words in the screengrab said. ""Honest question. And not all Senate incumbents either."" 
""Something stinks,"" the Instagram user wrote in response. ""This doesn’t make any sense.""
(Screengrab from Instagram)

The post has accurately described the results as they sat by midday Nov. 8, three days postelection. Although these results may not make sense at first glance, they happened for several reasons.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
Voters have free will. Presidential and Senate votes tend to align; in most 2024 Senate races, the same party did win both contests in the same state. But there’s a long-standing phenomenon known as ticket-splitting, in which voters may choose a Democrat for one office and a Republican for another. 
Ticket splitting has become less common in recent election cycles as partisan polarization has increased. In 2016, every Senate race went to the same party as the presidential race did, and in 2020, only Maine voters split their ticket in voting for Republican Sen. Susan Collins and for Joe Biden for president. But the practice hasn’t disappeared entirely.
In gubernatorial races, states such as Kansas, Kentucky, New Hampshire, Nevada, North Carolina and Virginia have chosen a governor of a different party than the presidential choice in the most recent election. And, in the current Congress, more than two dozen U.S. House members represent districts that the other party won in 2020.
Candidates matter. Voters split tickets because elections are a choice between candidates, not just between parties. Incumbency can help candidates; so can a lack of controversy, or a bigger war chest for campaign ads or a better-run campaign.
Two of the Senate races on the list cited in the post had incumbents prevail (or had them on track to prevail, pending additional ballot counting): Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin and Jacky Rosen of Nevada. Their achievements in office and voters’ familiarity may have helped these candidates. Some voters may have wanted to send a message on inflation in the presidential race but decided that the Senate has less to do with economic conditions than the president does.
Meanwhile, in North Carolina’s gubernatorial race, Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein faced Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, a Republican candidate who faced a flurry of revelations about his past controversial comments on race and sex. Robinson won about 40% of the vote in a state in which generic Republican candidates for statewide office can usually count on 50% or better.
And in Arizona, Republican Kari Lake came to voters’ attention in 2022 when she lost a gubernatorial race built heavily on claims that elections are fraudulent, including the presidential race that Biden won. This year, she lost to Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, a retired U.S. Marine and a Latino in a campaign year in which Latino voters were pivotal within the electorate.
Don’t sleep on third parties and nonvotes. In the four Senate-race split decisions, the margins were narrow. In these four states, the Democratic Senate candidates won (or are winning) by 17,000 to 44,000 votes; in Nevada, Michigan and Wisconsin, Harris lost (or is losing) by between 29,000 and 82,000 votes. Arizona was wider at 155,000.
With such small margins, other factors can figure in election results if you run the math.

In these states’ Senate races, third-party candidates received from 39,000 to 170,000 votes; in the presidential race, their haul ranged from 25,000 to 110,000.
Also, some people voted for president but not for a Senate candidate, and may have skipped other down-ballot races. Depending on the state, from 18,000 to 72,000 voters did this, according to PolitiFact’s calculations from The New York Times’ running election results page. If these Senate race-skippers consisted disproportionately of Trump voters, that by itself could have kept some of these Republican Senate candidates from winning.
Then there’s Nevada’s eccentric ballot option,""none of these candidates."" In the presidential race, about 18,000 voters chose this option; in the Senate race, more than 40,000 did. The number of ""none of these candidates"" voters in the Senate race is more than twice as large as Rosen’s current lead.
A nontrivial share of voters chose to back a third-party candidate or decline to choose anyone in the U.S. Senate race. In some or all of these states, that could have spelled the difference between victory and defeat. 
Our ruling
Social media posts said ""something stinks"" that Trump won in several battleground states while Democrats won Senate or governor races in those states.
Although there’s a strong historical correlation between votes cast for president and senator, it’s not ironclad. Voters are free to choose candidates of different parties for different offices, and some fraction of voters does so.
In each of these races, the Democrats benefited from an advantage or two, such as incumbency or a politically damaged opponent, that may have put them over the top.
Finally, in the four Senate races cited, the margins were narrow, meaning that third-party voters or voters who chose to vote for president and not the Senate race could have easily spelled the difference between victory and defeat.

Another clue the video is not showing earthquake footage is that none of the furniture or items in the room are shaking while the camera furiously shakes. Water bottles and a coffee pitcher remain still on a counter and lamps stay in place on bedside tables.
People can be seen relaxing in a pool, despite the supposed chaos around them.
When the person with the camera heads into the hotel’s walkway, we see trees unmoved by the supposed earthquake and a bag of luggage and ""wet floor"" sign that somehow don’t topple over as the ground supposedly moves around them.

An image styled to look like a newspaper’s front page recounted this tale on Facebook.

If the story of Santiago Flight 513 sounds too outlandish to be believed, that’s probably because the tale is fictional. 
A flight’s reappearance after 35 years would be newsworthy — as would a plane arriving at its destination carrying human remains rather than passengers. However, when we searched using Google, Newspapers.com and the Nexis news archive, we found no credible reports or information supporting claims that ""Santiago Flight 513"" had landed in Brazil in 1989 after 35 years. We also found no evidence or credible reports that a plane landed carrying 92 skeletons on board. 
Other details recounted in the image posted on Facebook do not withstand scrutiny. For example, we found no evidence that ""Santiago Airlines"" ever existed.

The Instagram post showed a world map with the U.S. highlighted in red, claiming to show ""countries that just elected a president who has been to Epstein’s island."" 
Trump and Epstein operated in the same social circles in the 1990s, and Trump occasionally spoke highly of him. But there has been no documented evidence that Trump visited Epstein’s private island, Little St. James in the Virgin Islands, where Epstein allegedly sexually abused underage girls. 
When federal agents charged Epstein with sex trafficking of minors in 2019, Trump, then president, said he was ""not a fan"" of Epstein. 
Trump has said he did not visit Epstein’s private island. Flight logs show that Trump flew on Epstein’s private plane at least seven times in the 1990s between Palm Beach and New York, but there’s no evidence Trump visited the island. Many other high-profile people, including former President Bill Clinton, were also recorded as guests on Epstein’s plane. 
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
What was Trump’s relationship with Epstein? 
Epstein died by suicide in 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. A federal indictment alleged Epstein had, for years, enticed and recruited underage girls to perform sex acts, and encouraged victims to recruit additional victims. The acts occurred both at his home in Manhattan and in Palm Beach, Florida, the indictment alleged. Abuse and sex trafficking also allegedly occurred at Little St. James, according to a lawsuit from the U.S. Virgin Islands attorney general. 
He was convicted on Florida state charges in 2008 for paying a minor for sex, after which he served jail time and registered as a sex offender.
Acquaintances of both Trump and Epstein said the two were friends in the 1990s, according to a 2019 Washington Post story. Epstein attended parties at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s private club in Palm Beach, and the two were photographed together in social settings multiple times.
In an interview for a 2002 New York magazine piece, Trump called Trump a ""terrific guy."" 
""It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side,"" Trump said.
After Epstein’s arrest in 2019, Trump said he ""had a falling out"" with Epstein, and said he had not spoken to him in 15 years. 
""I was not a fan of his, I can tell you that,"" Trump told reporters at the time.
In a September interview with podcaster Lex Fridman, Trump said he never visited Epstein’s private island. 
""I never went to his island, fortunately,"" Trump said. ""But a lot of people did.""
Sometime around the time Epstein first faced charges for sex crimes with minors, Trump banned him from Mar-a-Lago, the Washington Post reported.
In the 2016 book, ""The Clintons’ War on Women,"" Trump ally and political consultant Roger Stone — whom Trump pardoned after he was convicted for obstruction, making false statements and witness tampering — wrote that Trump had turned down multiple invitations to ""Epstein’s hedonistic private island and his Palm Beach home."" Stone wrote that Trump ""cut Epstein and his underlings off"" when he heard Palm Beach police were investigating Epstein.

Stone wrote that Trump told a Mar-a-Lago club member, ""‘The one time I visited his Palm Beach home, the swimming pool was full of beautiful young girls’ … ‘How nice,’ I thought, ‘he let the neighborhood kids use his pool.’""
Shortly before the Nov. 5 election, journalist and author Michael Wolff released excerpts from a 2017 interview with Epstein, in which Epstein claimed he was ""Donald Trump’s closest friend for 10 years."" However, the new audio included no statements from Epstein saying Trump had visited his island. The Trump campaign called Wolff a ""disgraced writer who routinely fabricates lies"" in response to the recording, according to The Daily Beast.
In October, former model Stacey Williams alleged Trump groped her in 1993 after Epstein introduced her to him. The Trump campaign denied Williams’ story.
The Trump campaign did not respond to a request from PolitiFact to comment on the Instagram post’s claim.
More than two dozen women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct over the decades, including writer E. Jean Carroll, to whom a jury awarded more than $83 million in a defamation lawsuit after she said he mocked and dismissed her after she accused him of rape.

These claims are inaccurate. There have been no credible allegations of election fraud or evidence of votes that disappeared during the 2024 election.
On Nov. 6, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly said that election officials are still counting votes and reported no incidents of compromised election security.
""As we have said repeatedly, our election infrastructure has never been more secure and the election community never better prepared to deliver safe, secure, free, and fair elections for the American people,"" Easterly said. ""This is what we saw yesterday in the peaceful and secure exercise of democracy. Importantly, we have no evidence of any malicious activity that had a material impact on the security or integrity of our election infrastructure.""
Similarly, Ishan Mehta, director of media and democracy at Common Cause, a public advocacy group, said the 2024 election was safe, secure and ""pretty smooth.""
He said Common Cause has thousands of volunteers in all 50 states who monitored the election at polling sites and vote counting centers. The group also has a team that monitors chatter about voting on social media. Because of that, Common Cause typically knows when election issues arise — and those incidents typically end up being ""some sort of machine or human error that we have systems to correct,"" Mehta said.
Such incidents do not mean ""the election was hacked, or there has been any sort of nefarious activity to change any Americans’ actual votes,"" he said.
""There is no evidence that any votes disappeared,"" or of other fraudulent activity during the 2024 election, Mehta said. He also said he knew of no evidence of attempts — let alone successful efforts — to ""hack"" or ""steal"" the election. 
Even if such attempts occurred, they would fail, experts said. 
""There is no one ‘hack’ to change the outcome of an election or to change vote totals,"" Mehta said. ""Each state has its own independent, non-connected systems,"" and election workers are trained to run elections and fix any issues that arise and take that responsibility seriously.
2024 voter turnout is still being calculated, but fluctuations don’t signal fraud, experts say 
Experts repeatedly told PolitiFact that voter turnout ebbs and flows from election to election.
Paul Gronke, a Reed College political science professor, said factors such as enthusiasm for the candidates, campaign efforts and an election’s competitiveness all affect voter turnout. 
""If the final results show that 20 million fewer votes were cast for the Democratic candidate for President in 2024 than in 2020, what that indicates is that 20 million voters made a decision not to cast a ballot, either not turn out at all, or not check the top contest,"" Gronke said. ""That’s the end of the story.""

Election denial is antidemocratic, said David Becker, the executive director and founder of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, a nonpartisan group that works with election officials from both political parties to build trust in elections. 
""We will know the full turnout once the votes are certified by the states, in a few weeks,"" he told PolitiFact. Becker pointed to data from the University of Florida: ""We’re on track to have the second highest turnout in votes in U.S. history, and the second or third highest turnout in percentage since 18 year olds were granted the right to vote,"" he said.
As of 4 p.m. Nov. 7, Trump received 72.8 million votes and Harris received about 68 million votes. In 2020, Trump received 74.2 million votes and President Joe Biden received 81.2 million.
""Election officials, election monitors, election lawyers, partisan observers, non partisan observers, and election science experts like myself pay very close attention to elections at every level,"" Gronke said. ""There have been reports of a few glitches in scattered locations. There is no evidence at all of anything fraudulent, certainly not on the kind of scale being suggested here.""

En 2017, Tesla fabricó un modelo de casa, la ""Tesla Tiny House"" que un coche eléctrico de la marca — concretamente el Model X — remolcó por Australia, para mostrar los productos de la marca. La ""Tesla Tiny House"" funcionaba con energía solar y dentro había productos de la marca que mostraban cómo sería una casa que funcionase con energía renovable, según informaron diversos medios de noticias. Pero eso era un modelo para mostrar productos de Tesla, y no una casa en sí. Tesla tampoco puso a la venta casas de como esa.
Realizamos una búsqueda en la página web de Tesla, y las únicas referencias a productos para casas están en las secciones de paneles solares, tejados solares y sistemas para instalar las viviendas para cargar los coches eléctricos de la marca.

That didn’t happen, a Wisconsin Elections Commission spokesperson said, and a social media disinformation expert said the video is Russian disinformation.
""BREAKING: CCTV captures the moment a Trump voter in WI is assaulted by two Kamala Harris thugs at a voting station in Wisconsin,"" said a lengthy Nov. 5 X post by an Australian political commentator that used the abbreviation for closed-circuit television.
The post shared a soundless video of what looks like a polling station with three people casting their ballots. In the video, a man wearing a red hat — presumably with now-President-elect Donald Trump’s ""Make America Great Again"" slogan — approaches with a ballot and a man voting wearing a white Harris hoodie confronts him and pushes him out of camera range. Then another person in a red hoodie assaults the Trump voter, who’s seen falling to the floor.
But that didn’t happen at a Wisconsin polling station, Wisconsin Elections Commission spokesperson Joel DeSpain wrote in an email to PolitiFact.

""We received no reports from law enforcement and no reports from any Wisconsin polling locations that this incident took place in the Badger State,"" DeSpain said.
NewsGuard, a company that tracks online false narratives, noted that Wisconsin does not allow people to wear politically themed attire, such as Trump hats or Harris hoodies, inside polling stations.
(Screenshot from X)
Darren Linvill, co-director of Clemson University’s Watt Family Innovation Center Media Forensics Hub, said in a Nov. 5 X post that the video is disinformation created by Storm-1516, a Russian influence operation. 
Storm-1516 was behind two recent Pants on Fire! fake videos that pretended to show Haitian immigrants in the U.S. illegally saying they are voting for Vice President Kamala Harris in Georgia, and a Bucks County, Pennsylvania, election official destroying mail ballots.
Linvill said he and his Clemson colleagues have tracked Storm-1516 for the past year and ""are very familiar with its tactics, techniques and procedures."" The Media Forensics Hub first identified the Russian network in December 2023, it said in an October report. 
Linvill told PolitiFact that there are several reasons they attributed the Wisconsin video to Storm-1516, including the video’s attempt to incite violence and the group’s previous videos targeting battleground states Pennsylvania and Georgia.
""The origin account (Scott Goldberg, using the X handle @izzagg) is an account that only recently started posting,"" Linvill said, adding that it’s consistent with how Storm-1516 has created videos in the past — by creating an account and making videos that ""look just plausible enough to be convincing if you don’t look too hard.""  
Another Storm-1516 hallmark is that the video, which is shot from above, shows no faces or anything that could possibly identify anyone, Linvill said.

Linvill said Storm-1516 used an account named @AlertChannel, which is part of its regular distribution network, to boost the video.
The group also used Jamie McIntyre, ""an Australian influencer who joined the distribution network a couple of months ago,"" Linvill said.
We found another Australian account sharing the video on X. As of Nov. 7, X had suspended the @AlertChannel and Scott Golberg (@izzaag) accounts that originally shared it.
X suspended three accounts that shared Russian disinformation about the election, including the Wisconsin video, CBS News reported. We contacted X via email for comment but did not immediately receive a response.
Linvill said it’s likely that McIntyre’s account wasn’t suspended because he is a public figure and a real person, he said. Linvill said the Goldberg account was a fake persona and @Alertchannel was anonymous, and therefore easier to suspend.
Our ruling
An X post claimed to show a video of a Trump supporter being assaulted by two Harris supporters at a Wisconsin polling station.
But a Wisconsin Elections Commission spokesperson said it received no reports of an assault happening at a polling station. A disinformation expert said the video has the hallmarks of Storm-1516, a Russian disinformation campaign that targeted swing states in the 2024 U.S. election.

In 2020, President Joe Biden won the popular vote with more than 81 million votes. Trump got 74 million. Votes from the 2024 election were still being counted Nov. 7, but as of 4 p.m. EST, Trump had gotten more than 72 million votes to Vice President Kamala Harris’ 68 million.
The difference in votes between the 2020 and 2024 elections is not evidence of fraud. Just as there was none in 2020, there is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2024 election.

""Our election infrastructure has never been more secure and the election community never better prepared to deliver safe, secure, free, and fair elections for the American people,"" Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly said in a Nov. 6 statement. ""This is what we saw yesterday in the peaceful and secure exercise of democracy. Importantly, we have no evidence of any malicious activity that had a material impact on the security or integrity of our election infrastructure.""
Ballots are still being counted
Although the media called a winner based on existing counts and electoral gains, it’s still unclear precisely how many votes each candidate received and how those results compare with the 2020 election.
""Indeed, in some states, election officials can continue to accept vote-by-mail or absentee ballots that were postmarked by Election Day and are delivered over the next few days, so we don’t even yet know the total number of votes cast,"" Florida State University election law professor Michael Morley said.
Every state has different deadlines for completing ballot counting, which range from one to four weeks after Election Day. After states finish their counts, they then must certify the results. Those deadlines fall in November and December.
Just as the final vote tally for each candidate is currently unknown, so is the 2024 election’s voter turnout.
""We won’t have a complete picture of voter turnout comparisons across elections until each state provides certified voter turnout files,"" said Carolina Lopez, executive director of the Partnership for Large Election Jurisdictions, a nonpartisan organization that works with election officials in jurisdictions of 300,000 people or more.
It’s also memorable that the 2020 election had record high voter turnout. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 67% of citizens 18 or older reported voting. A Washington Post analysis showed voter turnout in 2024 is on pace to be close to 2020. 
Early voter turnout isn’t an indicator of who won the election 
In the weeks before Election Day, local news organizations reported record-setting early voter turnout in different states. By Nov. 4, the day before Election Day, more than 78 million ballots had been cast in 42 states and Washington, D.C., according to a CNN analysis. In 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, 110 million people voted early in person or by mail, according to CNN.

But high early voter counts don’t signal a fraudulent Trump win. Not all the millions of early voters cast ballots for Harris. It’s also difficult to draw conclusions about voter behavior during the 2024 election by comparing it with the 2020 election, when Trump discouraged early and mail voting. 
""Republican messaging concerning vote by mail and absentee ballots has changed this election cycle,"" Morley said, adding that Republicans encouraged early and mail voting. ""Accordingly, we would expect the partisan breakdown of voters who use those methods of voting to have changed between the 2020 and 2024 elections.""
Our ruling
A social media user said: ""I think they found a way to target Democratic districts and send millions of votes into a black hole. The numbers aren't adding up.""
However, just as there was no widespread voter fraud in 2020, there is no evidence of it in the 2024 election. 
Ballots are still being counted, so it’s unclear how many votes each candidate received, and how those results compare with the 2020 election. 
Millions of people voted early, setting records in some states. But those early voters could have supported Trump, Harris, a third party candidate or chosen not to vote in the presidential election at all.

The truth is, they never existed. I think we can put the lie about Biden’s 80 million votes to rest once and for all.""
D’Souza was behind the widely discredited 2022 movie ""2,000 Mules"" that outlined an unsubstantiated effort by ""mules"" to illegally deposit ballots into ballot drop boxes to sway the 2020 election.
We saw similar claims from conservative commentator Benny Johnson, who called the 2020 to 2024 Democratic vote count difference ""very sus,"" short for suspicious, and J.R. Majewski, an Ohio Republican who ran for Congress unsuccessfully in 2022 and 2024, who declared the results proved ""2020 was stolen."" 
These claims are a revamped version of the persistent falsehood that the 2020 election was fraudulent, which PolitiFact has debunked countless times.

We tried contacting D’Souza through his online store and Instagram account, and received no response before publication. 
The 2020 election was not stolen. President Joe Biden won the 2020 election. States certified the results, Congress accepted the results and Biden was inaugurated in January 2021. Election security officials — including Republicans and people in Trump’s own administration — have said the 2020 election was secure. When fraud occurred, it was isolated and did not change the results. In four years, Trump and his allies have produced no evidence of widespread fraud.
Across the country, Trump and his allies lost more than 60 lawsuits challenging the 2020 election outcome. A group of Republicans, including former federal judges, examined Trump and his allies’ fraud and miscount claims and concluded that they ""failed to present evidence of fraud or inaccurate results `significant enough to invalidate the results.""’
Trump’s 2024 victory has not changed these facts. 
Shifts in vote totals from election to election do not signal fraud, experts said
From election to election, millions of voters potentially shifting support from one party to another isn’t unusual, experts told PolitiFact. 
Kim Wyman, a Bipartisan Policy Center senior fellow, said about 40% of voters in the U.S. consider themselves independents and ""elections are won and lost with that 40%."" 
""Those middle voters vote all over the map and are the ones who decide the outcome,"" she said. 
Wyman, a Republican, was Washington’s secretary of state from 2013 to 2021, when she stepped down to take a position as a Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency senior election security adviser. She said the explanation for the 2024 results would be in election return data.
""Democrats did not suddenly lose 20 million voters,"" she said, outlining potential explanations for the 2024 outcome. 
First, she said, it’s possible that 20 million Republicans or independent voters who either did not vote in the 2020 presidential election or voted for Biden in 2020 chose to vote for Trump in 2024. 
Second, it’s possible that solid Democrats who did not want to vote for Trump or Harris did not vote in 2024 or possibly chose another candidate, such as Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Potentially, ""the 20 million is a combination"" of those two outcomes, Wyman said.
Jordan Barth, a former national and state Democratic Party staff member, said that even if the final vote counts show that 20 million more people voted for Biden in 2020 than voted for Harris in 2024, that wouldn’t prove the 2020 election was fraudulent. 
""We saw some pretty significant changes in 2016 with the electorate,"" said Barth, who in 2020 was the hotline and research coordinator for the Democratic National Committee’s civic engagement and voter protection department. Places that had voted for Democratic President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 went for Trump in 2016. Then, in 2020, at least some of those voters ""went back to Biden."" 
Wyman said election officials used the same processes and protocols during the 2020 and 2024 elections.

""While some states may have changed some laws, the security control measures remained consistent,"" she said. ""Just because voters show up and vote differently four years later doesn't mean there is fraud or suppression. It could just mean that voters changed their minds.""
The votes are still being counted
William Adler, the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Election Project associate director, said the stolen 2020 election claims overlook a misleading and basic detail: The popular vote isn’t known yet.
Although state margins, in terms of percentage points, might be close to the final results, current claims about actual numbers of voters hold little weight. 
""As counting continues, the difference between the number of votes Biden received and the number that Harris received is guaranteed to shrink,"" he said. 
That is already playing out. By 2 p.m. ET Nov. 6, the Harris vote totals that Johnson, Majewski and D’Souza mentioned in their X posts were outdated: Harris had received more than 67 million votes — and that was with incomplete counts in several states with high numbers of Democrats, including California, Oregon and Washington. 
""California is currently only 60% reported,"" Charles Stewart III, director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Election Data and Science Lab, told PolitiFact at around 12:30 p.m. ET. States including Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Mississippi, Oregon, Utah and Washington ""still have at least 20% of their votes to report.""
Our ruling
D’Souza claimed the results of the 2024 election show that Biden’s 80 million votes in 2020 were a ""lie.""
Republican state and federal officials said the election was secure and dozens of judges have rejected Trump lawsuits alleging widespread fraud in the 2020 election. 
From election to election, voters shifting support from one party to another — or forgoing voting — isn’t unusual or a sign of fraud, experts said. They also warned that votes are still being counted, and the margin of votes separating Harris’ 2024 total and Biden’s 2020 total is likely to shrink.

One social media user said in a Nov. 5 X post that an MSNBC report about an upcoming ballot drop was suspicious.
""BREAKING! Vans filled with 50,000 ballots show up in Philadelphia while live on MSNBC.

In a reply to his own post, the person said, ""SOMETHING MUST BE DONE IMMEDIATELY!!!"" We found other X users posting video of the report and claiming it showed something nefarious. 
NewsGuard, a company that tracks online false narratives, said the claim began to spread among conservative social media users shortly after midnight. ""Trucks full of ballots pulling up at 12am in Philly. Nothing to see here, folks,"" wrote End Wokeness, a conservative account with 3 million followers.

In the MSNBC report, NBC News political and national correspondent Jacob Soboroff was reporting outside Philadelphia’s election warehouse at 11:51 p.m. EST. He said 50,000 ballots would be released in the next nine minutes and then another 37,000 ballots the next day.
Soboroff pointed out two arriving vehicles escorted by police that he said may be some ballots or something else arriving at the site. But he did not say those vehicles were carrying the 50,000 ballots he had mentioned.
""No, that is not correct. Nor is that post,"" Soboroff said in an X message to PolitiFact.

The trucks seen arriving in the MSNBC report did not contain any ballots, Kevin Feeley, a spokesperson for Philadelphia City Commissioner Seth Bluestein, a Republican, said in an email to PolitiFact.
""All the mail ballots that remain to be counted were delivered to the warehouse hours before this video was recorded,"" Feeley said. 
Feeley said the video showed the delivery of polling place records and equipment, including electronic poll books — tablets or laptops used in part to look up eligible voters — that were being returned to the election warehouse as the polling places were closing.

News reports show there was a Philadelphia ballot update at midnight, which could explain the 50,000 ballots Soboroff mentioned. CNN anchor Kate Bolduan also said at 11:12 p.m. EST that ""tens of thousands"" of mail ballots were expected to be posted at 11:55 p.m. EST, citing an unnamed source.
As for the 37,000 ballots, the Philadelphia Inquirer and Politico reported that city officials said 37,000 mail ballots were uncounted as of midnight Nov. 6.

An X post said that 50,000 ballots arrived in vans as an MSNBC reporter referred to that number of ballots during a live report.
But the ballots he was speaking about were already at the city’s election warehouse, and the vehicles were delivering election equipment from polling places that had closed.

Apparent errors in the audio are one clue the viral videos are fake. Instead of pledging to ""make our ties stronger,"" Trump’s voice says ""make out ties stronger,"" which doesn’t make grammatical sense. (It may have also been a typo for someone typing a script.)
Also, Trump’s lips don’t align with the words spoken in the audio.
Reverse-image searches show the footage comes from a 2017 NBC News interview, India Today reported. In it, Trump wears the same outfit, speaks in front of the same background and moves his lips in sync with the sound of the words he speaks.

PolitiFact did a reverse-image search of the video of Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, and found that this video is from 2017 and was taken out of context. 
Fox News republished the video in August with the headline: ""Flashback: Harris told Americans not to say 'Merry Christmas' until DACA was fixed."" 
Harris made her comment during a Dec. 19, 2017, news conference at the United Methodist Building in Washington, D.C., near the U.S. Capitol, when she was a Democratic U.S. senator representing California. Harris was referring to how people could say ""Merry Christmas"" to each other if Congress didn’t pass the DREAM Act, which stands for Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors. The act would have provided a pathway to citizenship for some immigrants who came to the United States illegally as children, according to NBC News. 
The DREAM Act’s first version was introduced in 2001, and during the last 20 years, at least 20 versions have been introduced in Congress. But so far none has passed, according to the American Immigration Council, an immigrant-rights advocacy group. The 2010 version of the bill came closest to full passage when it passed the House of Representatives but fell just five votes short of the 60 needed to proceed in the Senate. 
Harris made her remarks after Trump, as president, ordered in fall 2017 the phase out of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which permitted certain people brought to the U.S. illegally as children to live and work in the United States and temporarily protected them from deportation. 
""It is morally wrong, and when we all sing happy tunes and sing ""Merry Christmas"" and wish each other ""Merry Christmas."" These children are not going to have a Merry Christmas,"" Harris says  during the 58-second video. ""How dare we speak ""Merry Christmas""? How dare we? They will not have a Merry Christmas, they don’t know if they will be here in a matter of days, weeks and months."" 
NBC Latino posted Harris' quote on a 2017 X post, saying she was at a DREAM Act rally. PolitiFact couldn’t find the original video of Harris’ speech at the news conference.

In strong winds, live power lines falling down or knocking into dry vegetation can spark wildfires. So, if weather conditions merit it, utilities in California can be intentionally turned off to specific areas to reduce fire risk — this is called a public safety power shut-off.

Because of expected low relative humidity, dryer vegetation and gusting winds on election night, the criteria for a public safety power shut-off, PG&E began notifying people on Nov. 3 about a potential public safety power shut-off the evening of Nov. 5. 
PG&E announced the morning of Nov. 5 that five polling locations, but no vote tabulation centers, fall within the potential shut-off’s scope. 
Nevertheless, none of the public safety power shut-offs are expected to take place when voting is taking place, PG&E spokesperson Jeff Smith said.

A related viral claim said there were ""7,000+ Polling Locations Potentially Affected,"" by the shut-off. But this isn’t true, either. PG&E provides electricity to more than 7,000 polling stations, but only a few of them fall within the potential shut-off area. 
As for the claim that this shut-off would affect only Republican voters, in 2020 Joe Biden won all three counties within the scope of the shut-offs: Solano, Lake, and Santa Clara.

""Philadelphia city commissioners’ office tells non-citizens they can vote if they are Philly residents,"" read a Nov. 4 X post from O’Keefe Media Group, the creation of founder and former Project Veritas leader James O’Keefe.
In the video, O’Keefe — who left Project Veritas in 2023 when its board accused him of spending donor funds on ""personal luxuries""  — said he was standing outside a Philadelphia city commissioners’ office, where people were early voting. Across the street, he said, was a gathering of people from Ceiba, a nonprofit promoting economic development in Latino communities.
""They are telling people to vote,"" O’Keefe said in the video, appearing to refer to people associated with Ceiba. ""They are telling people that all you need is what is called an (ITIN) number.""
He then showed footage that he said showed an undercover reporter getting confirmation from the nonprofit and a county commissioner’s office worker that ""she can vote with nothing but an ITIN number"" and ""you only need to be a resident of Philadelphia.""

""ITIN"" refers to an individual taxpayer identification number, a nine-digit number the Internal Revenue Service issues to people filing tax returns who are not U.S. citizens and who do not have or are not eligible for Social Security numbers.

The video gained traction on X, with several leading conservatives, including conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, amplifying it as an example of election misconduct.

""This is the smoking gun of attempted election theft,"" Jones wrote.

""BREAKING: PENNSYLVANIA ELECTION FRAUD!"" wrote another X user who shared the post.

But this video does not show proof of noncitizen voting in the federal election. O’Keefe founded Project Veritas, a right-wing organization known for doing undercover reporting and using selectively edited videos. This video used a similar format. (O’Keefe was sued in 2021 and, following a settlement earlier this year, apologized for falsely claiming a postal worker committed voter fraud.)
Federal law requires voters be U.S. citizens to vote in federal elections, and although a small number of municipalities nationwide permit noncitizen voting in local races, Philadelphia is not among them.
""This report is incorrect and not supported at all by the facts,"" Philadelphia City Commissioner Seth Bluestein, a Republican, wrote Nov. 4  on X, responding to the O’Keefe video. ""Non-citizens are not eligible to vote in Philadelphia. A mail ballot provided by our office can only be counted after the voter verifies their ID, typically with a social security number or driver’s license number.""
Spokesperson Kevin Feeley sent PolitiFact a statement from the Philadelphia City Commissioners that described the video as ""selectively edited"" and said it showed ""a staffer at one of our Satellite Elections offices explaining voter eligibility requirements.""
""Noncitizens may not legally register to vote or cast a ballot anywhere in Pennsylvania, including Philadelphia,"" the spokesperson’s statement said.
Ceiba also addressed the video, writing on Instagram that its organization was ""targeted by an organized group of individuals who recorded our staff, and falsely accused us of registering non-citizens to vote.""

In a second Instagram statement, Ceiba added that one of its staff members incorrectly answered a question about whether ITINs can be used to vote. It said that does not align with its training or practice.

Pennsylvania voters who are voting for the first time in their election districts must show proof of identification, and an ITIN is not a valid proof of identity.
""The ITIN, used to help noncitizens to pay their taxes, is a distinct number and it is impossible for someone to use it to register to vote,"" Ceiba’s Instagram statement said.

White House spokesperson Andrew Bates told PolitiFact the claim was false.
First, noncitizens are not eligible to vote in federal elections. Noncitizens who vote face federal and state penalties including imprisonment and, if they are illegally in the country, deportation.
Second, federal law prohibits armed and civil law enforcement activity at polling places, except when it is ""necessary to repel armed enemies of the United States."" This provision prevents immigration enforcement at polling locations. 
Field directors and agents in charge reminded employees not to wear uniforms and other markings while they were voting, citing U.S. code. 
""Like all federal law enforcement officers, the agency’s officers and agents are prohibited by federal statute from taking enforcement actions at polling places,"" Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesperson Jeff Carter told PolitiFact.

Pero las publicaciones están equivocadas sobre cómo reciben y emiten su voto los miembros del servicio militar activo en el extranjero. 
El Pentágono no interviene en el envío de votos por correo. Cada estado es responsable de gestionar sus procesos electorales, dijo un portavoz del Pentágono en un correo electrónico a PolitiFact.
Para votar, los militares y sus cónyuges deben solicitar el voto en ausencia a sus estados de origen. Pueden hacerlo a través del Programa Federal de Asistencia para Votar del Departamento de Defensa. 
El programa ofrece ayuda para votar a los miembros del servicio militar, sus familias y otras personas que viven en el extranjero. Los votantes pueden utilizar la página web para registrarse para votar, solicitar boletas estatales y consultar las fechas y plazos de las elecciones.
La publicación en X de Webb fue etiquetada con una nota de la comunidad — el enfoque de colaboración colectiva de la plataforma para hacer frente a la desinformación. Esta nota  señalaba que el Pentágono no envía boletas y proporcionaba más contexto. Webb respondió a la nota señalando a una carta del 30 de octubre enviada por los representantes republicanos de Florida Brian Mast y Mike Waltz junto con Bill Huizenga, republicano de Michigan, al secretario de Defensa Lloyd Austin.
En la carta, los representantes dijeron que los miembros del servicio militar activo estaban preocupados por la ""educación inadecuada"" del Pentágono sobre cómo votar. También dijeron que cuando algunos miembros pidieron una boleta federal de voto en ausencia por escrito porque sus boletas de voto por correo no llegaron a tiempo, les dijeron que la base se había quedado sin.

Si la boleta de voto en ausencia de un miembro del servicio que envía el estado no llega a tiempo, el miembro puede utilizar la boleta federal de voto en ausencia por escrito disponible en línea como un respaldo, dijo Ryder.
Un miembro del servicio que utilice esa boleta no necesita solicitarla a su base militar. Pueden imprimir las boletas desde la página web del Programa Federal de Asistencia para Votar. El 5 de noviembre, esta página web incluyó información sobre cómo acceder a la boleta.

County and state officials confirmed on Election Day morning that Cambria County, Pennsylvania, vote tabulating machines were unable to scan ballots because of technical issues. Later that afternoon, county officials said the issue was caused by a ballot printing error, which made the ballots unreadable by tabulators, according to local NBC affiliate WJAC-TV. 
The issue was corrected by Tuesday afternoon, WJAC reported, and the county’s polling places were supplied with new ballots that were able to be tabulated and processed by the machines. 
Before the issue was resolved, voters were still able to fill out paper ballots and securely cast them. 
The ballots that were cast before the issue was resolved will be hand counted, Cambria County Solicitor Ron Repak told WJAC. Voters who used an electronic ballot marking device, rather than filling out a paper ballot, also had no problem casting their ballot, local officials said.

The concern led some social media users to claim the delays were evidence of election fraud. One X post said, ""The election steal is happening,"" pointing to the reported issues.
The Pennsylvania Department of State wrote Nov. 5 on X it was aware of the issues and was working to resolve them. The department said voters were still casting paper ballots.
""The Department of State is in contact with county officials in Cambria County,"" Pennsylvania Department of State spokesperson Amy Gulli told PolitiFact. ""Voters are continuing to vote by paper ballot, in accordance with normal operations, while the county resolves the issue with in-precinct scanning.""
With more than 3,000 counties across the United States, each with different systems for recording and counting votes, technical issues sometimes happen. But there’s no evidence the problems are evidence of an ""election steal,"" as some social media users claimed. 
Around 69,800 people voted in Cambria County in 2020, which former President Donald Trump won by 37 percentage points. The county, about 60 miles east of Pittsburgh, has a population of about 133,500.
A Pennsylvania judge approved a petition from the Cambria County Board of Elections to extend voting two hours, to 10 p.m., because of the issues. The extension applies only to Cambria County.
The malfunction ""caused voter confusion, long lines of voters, and many individuals left the polling locations without casting a ballot,"" according to the petition.

Repak said in a Nov. 5 statement that votes cast during the period when the tabulating machines failed were securely accepted, stored and counted, WJAC reported. 
""There is a process in place for issues of this nature,"" Repak said. ""All completed ballots will be accepted, secured, and counted by the Board of Elections.""
Cambria County uses voting systems from Election Systems & Software, known as ES&S, one of five approved vendors in the state. 
Before the problem was resolved, ES&S spokesperson Katina Granger told PolitiFact the company was working with the county to address it. Granger described the scanning problem as stemming from ""an issue with the printed ballot."" 
""This morning, voters after hand marking their ballot were instructed to place their ballots into the auxiliary bin of the ballot box,"" Granger said. ""These ballots will all be counted after polls close.""
Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley in an X post encouraged affected voters to stay in line and fill out and deliver their ballots. The Republican Party of Pennsylvania intervened to support the county’s petition to extend voting hours, according to a Republican National Committee press release.
The Cambria County tabulating machine issues caused delays and confusion at voting sites, but ballots were still being accepted and the time to vote was extended. Local officials prepare for technical issues, and officials said all ballots will be counted. There was no evidence the errors were an intentional attempt to suppress votes.

An Oct. 30 Instagram post shared a video of Benson answering a question at an Oct. 28 press briefing about a problem with split-ticket voting using a specific type of Dominion voting machine. Benson initially said the programming issue was ""a nationwide issue,"" but her office and Dominion clarified Oct. 30 this was happening only in Michigan.

""According to (Benson’s) office, this ‘programming issue’ CANNOT be fixed, and voters are being forced to deal with it,"" the X user wrote. This X post received millions of views.
The Michigan Department of State said in an Oct. 25 statement that the programming snag has made voting more inconvenient for some voters, but it hasn’t prevented any voters from casting ballots.
The problem is specific to voters using Dominion’s voter assist terminals, or VATs, which are designed to help voters with disabilities, the department said. All Michigan voting locations are required to have voter assist terminals, but not all of the state’s voting machines are designed by Dominion. Sixty-five of Michigan’s 83 counties use Dominion voting equipment.
If a voter using this type of machine selects the ""straight-party"" option to vote for all candidates of one party, but then decides to vote for a candidate of a different party, the voter will receive an error message, the state department said.
To fix the problem, ""the voter will need to go back and de-select their straight-party selection and vote for candidates in the races individually or vote straight party without splitting their ticket,"" the state department said.
Dominion issued a statement Oct. 25 with similar instructions for Michigan voters using the voter assist terminals.
""Voters seeking to vote for a single party for all contests can use the straight-party option,"" Dominion said. ""Voters seeking to split their ticket by choosing one or more candidates of a different political party should be advised not to select the straight-party voting option.""

Dominion said in an Oct. 30 statement that this programming error was not happening with voter assist terminals in other states that have straight-ticket voting. The voting equipment company said the Michigan secretary of state’s office updated its website Oct. 30 to clarify that the problem was specific to Michigan.
In Michigan, voters typically have the option to vote straight-party but then override their party selection for individual races, the state department said.
Voters will be able to review their selections before printing their ballots and putting them in the scanner for tabulation, the state department said.
The state department said it’s impossible to fix the voter assist terminals’ programming this close to Election Day, but the problem will be corrected for future elections.
""Although the issue will not stop people from voting or making their preferred selections, and it will not change anyone’s votes, it will make the process more inconvenient for some voters using the VATs,"" the state department said.

An Instagram post claimed, ""It’s now been confirmed by Dominion that their voting machines have a programming issue that will affect vote counts.""
Michigan voters using Dominion’s voter assist terminals who select straight-ticket voting and then decide to vote across party lines will receive an error message because of a programming issue, the Michigan State Department said. This can be fixed by deselecting the straight-ticket voting option and choosing candidates individually, or by voting only for candidates of the same political party.
The Michigan Department of State said the programming error could be inconvenient to voters, but it won’t block them from casting ballots. All voters will be able to cast ballots with their chosen candidates. Dominion did not say this problem will affect vote counts.

The Pentagon has no role in sending absentee ballots. Each state is responsible for managing their election processes, a Pentagon spokesperson said in an email to PolitiFact.

Military service members and their spouses must request absentee ballots from their home states to vote. They can do so through the Defense Department’s Federal Voting Assistance Program. 
The program provides voting assistance for service members, their families and other people living overseas. Voters can use the site to register to vote, request state ballots and navigate election dates and deadlines.
Webb’s X post, which was tagged with a community note pointing out that the Pentagon doesn’t send ballots, provides more context behind the claim. Webb responded to the note by pointing to an Oct. 30 letter sent by Reps. Brian Mast, R-Fla., Bill Huizenga, R-Mich., and Mike Waltz R-Fla., to U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.
The representatives said in the letter that active-duty service members had raised concerns about the Pentagon’s ""inadequate education"" on how to vote and that when some members whose mail ballots did not arrive in time requested a federal write-in ballot, they were told the base had run out. Webb, in another X post, said the Pentagon is responsible for providing those ballots.

If a service member’s absentee ballot sent by the state doesn’t arrive in time, members can use the Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot available online as a backup, Ryder said.
A service member using that ballot doesn’t need to request it from their military base. They can print the ballots out themselves from the Federal Voting Assistance Program website. The program’s website on Nov. 5 included information on how to access the backup ballot.

A recent Threads post draws attention to that image, but makes a claim that takes it out of context. 
""Just to be clear, DJTJ has a banner photo of Joe Biden being hung from a helicopter,"" the Oct. 28 post said. 
It was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)
In late August 2021, conservative websites, pundits and politicians, such as U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, claimed that the Taliban had hanged someone from a helicopter flying over Afghanistan. The viral rumor was based on a short, blurry video that showed a helicopter flying with a person dangling from a rope beneath it. PolitiFact and numerous other news outlets concluded that the person wasn’t hanged but wearing a harness and waving his arms.

Cruz eventually deleted a tweet that said: ""This horrifying image encapsulates Joe Biden’s Afghanistan catastrophe: The Taliban hanging a man from an American Blackhawk helicopter. Tragic. Unimaginable.""
Trump Jr., meanwhile, changed his Twitter banner to the image of Biden’s name with a helicopter and someone hanging from it. 
""Donald Trump Jr. has changed his Twitter banner to a Biden-mocking image featuring a man appearing to be hanged from a helicopter, though, again, the helicopter execution story was imaginary,"" CNN reporter Daniel Dale posted Sept. 1, 2021, on what is now X.

""Kari Lake is threatening Social Security and Medicare, taking the benefits we earned,"" a Facebook and Instagram ad from WinSenate, a Democratic political action committee, said. 
According to Meta’s Ad Library, the ad started running Oct. 24. We previously fact-checked WinSenate in October for a different claim about the Pennsylvania Senate race.
This claim about Lake needs context. 
On one hand, Lake has vowed to not touch funding for Social Security and Medicare, according to reporting from The Arizona Republic. She also said she will ""never vote to reduce or hurt Social Security"" during an Association of Mature American Citizens forum in May. 
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
At the same event, however, she proposed overhauling the federal budget. 
""I think we can slash the federal government by 50%. Most of it is grossly overweighted with employees that are doing nothing,"" Lake said.
In July, Lake raised her proposed budget cuts to ""50% to 75%"" in remarks to the Payson Tea Party in northern Arizona, according to the Payson Roundup, a local news outlet. Later that month, Lake won the Republican primary to face off against Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego. 
It’s unclear whether Lake meant that 50% to 75% cut to refer to the entire federal budget, or everything left over after retaining Social Security. Lake’s campaign did not respond to PolitiFact’s multiple requests to clarify her position.
In 2023, the federal budget was about $6.1 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Of that, Social Security accounts for about 14%, with Medicare accounting for an additional 21%. So, if she meant cutting 50% to 75% of the entire federal budget, it would be hard to avoid cutting one or both programs.
Even if she intended to protect Social Security in full and cut 50% to 75% of everything else, then those cuts would be massive. The discretionary part of the budget, which doesn’t include mandatory programs, such as Social Security and Medicare, exceeds $1.7 trillion, roughly half for defense programs and half for everything else the government does.

Steve Ellis, the president of nonprofit budget watchdog Taxpayers for Common Sense, said in an emailed statement that ""it’s hard to see the math work"" for Lake’s proposal.
""If she was talking about cutting the primary deficit by those percentages, it would still be a big leap, but something that could be done with hard choices on both the spending and revenue side,"" Ellis said. 
Our ruling
A pro-Democratic groupsaid Lake ""is threatening Social Security and Medicare."" 
Lake has said on several occasions that she won’t cut the two programs. 
However, she has called for a 50% to 75% reduction in the federal budget, without specifying how that fits with her intention to protect Social Security. At the high end of that range, Social Security and Medicare funding would be at risk for cuts.

stated on October 27, 2024 in a post on X:",“The United States Postal Service recently changed the delivery method of absentee mail-in ballots” to hide “the evidence of absentee mail-in ballot fraud.”,"stated on October 27, 2024 in a post on X:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/nov/04/tweets/no-proof-us-postal-service-recently-changed-the-de/,,"In an election-focused group on Elon Musk’s X platform, a man made what he described as ""bombshell"" allegations about the U.S. Postal Service.  
""The United States Postal Service recently changed the delivery method of absentee mail-in ballots!"" Peter Bernegger wrote in an Oct. 27 post. ""They are hiding the evidence of absentee mail-in ballot fraud - by not allowing the evidence to be created in the first place.""
In a nearly 400-word post, Bernegger accused the Postal Service of improperly directed post offices ""to NOT send absentee mail-in ballots to central sort. But instead take them to the election clerks."" He said that meant ""no electronic ballot images are being created,"" which he argued amounted to intentionally hiding fraud. 
Bernegger, based in Wisconsin, has rejected the 2020 election’s results. Since 2020, he has filed numerous lawsuits against local election offices, accusing them of fraud while promoting his litigation and false election fraud claims online, The Guardian reported. The Wisconsin Elections Commission in 2022 fined Bernegger more than $2,400 for making frivolous election complaints. 
In February, Wisconsin prosecutors accused Bernegger of falsifying a subpoena for an election-related case, and he was charged with ""simulating legal process,"" a felony. The criminal case against him continues.

Bernegger shared his post to the ""Election Integrity"" Community that Musk’s Political Action Committee created on X. Since it was established Oct. 21, the group has amassed over 60,000 members, many of whom circulate inaccurate election narratives, including multiple claims we have fact-checked. 
We contacted Bernegger on X and by email through his organization, Election Watch, but received no response.
(Screenshot from X)
Bernegger’s post provided no evidence to support his claim. He included an image of a letter from the Postal Service that said the agency found no documents that would satisfy his Freedom of Information Act records request for ""all the electronic images of all absentee mail-in ballots"" sent by municipal and county clerks in Wisconsin from Sept. 17 to Oct. 14. He also attributed the alleged changes to Amber McReynolds, the U.S. Postal Service’s Board of Governors’ vice chair and a President Joe Biden appointee. 
We searched using Google and the Nexis news archive, and found no credible reports or information supporting the claim that McReynolds advocated for mail ballots delivery changes in 2024. We also found no credible reports that the Postal Service had made changes to its procedures for mail ballots. 
U.S. Postal Service spokesperson Martha Johnson told PolitiFact that the Postal Service has not ""recently changed the delivery method of absentee ballots"" as the posts claim. The Postal Service has used the same procedures for previous general elections, she said. 
U.S. Postal Service’s ""extraordinary measures"" for election mail aren’t new
As it has in past election years, the Postal Service on Oct. 21 launched what it describes as ""extraordinary measures"" that Johnson said are ""designed to accelerate the delivery of ballots mailed close to Election Day.""
The measures include additional collections, extra deliveries, special sorting plans on processing equipment and a different way of handling mailed ballots, Johnson said.
""Under normal operations, any piece of mail, including an absentee ballot, is handled and postmarked at the processing facility closest to its originating post office and, depending on how far it is going, will be handled again at one or more processing facilities closer to its (destination) post office,"" Johnson said. 
Under the special election year process, however, mailed ballots addressed to a local or nearby election office ""will bypass the processing operation and will instead be postmarked at the local unit and delivered to the election office,"" Johnson said. ""This is consistent with our practice in previous general elections."" 
The agency’s 2020 press release used the same ""extraordinary measures"" language. We also found a more detailed October 2020 memorandum that detailed similar provisions, including one authorizing local post offices to postmark and deliver ballots to boards of elections ""rather than the ballots being placed into the automation flow."" A September 2022 memo said the agency would employ the same ""extraordinary measures"" as it had in 2020.

Barbara Smith Warner, executive director of the National Vote at Home Institute, said the special procedures for ballots are ""well known"" and ""regularly implemented"" among Postal Service offices and personnel across the country. 
""The extraordinary measures process is established for every general election, and was not done out of the blue,"" she said. 
In 2024, the Postal Service’s ""extraordinary measures"" for election mail started earlier, but they ""are the same or mostly the same"" as the measures in 2020 and 2022, said Amy Cohen, who works closely with state election officials nationwide as executive director of the National Association of State Election Directors.

Cohen added that although the measures mean some ballots don’t go to processing facilities, ""keeping election mail local helps it move faster through the system."" 
There might not be digital images of ballot envelopes, but that doesn’t equal fraud
If ballots bypass automated processing, the Postal Service may not generate electronic images of the ballot envelopes as it usually would as part of its informed delivery service, according to the agency’s website. Informed delivery is an opt-in Postal Service program that sends image previews of incoming Postal Service mail. Those images, however, ""are only provided for letter-sized mailpieces that are processed through USPS's automated equipment,"" the Postal Service website says. 
But there’s no evidence that a lack of images signals fraud. 
Brenden Donahue, U.S. assistant postal inspector in charge at the United States Postal Inspection Service, told PolitiFact it does not threaten election security when digital images of ballot envelopes aren’t created. 
""The Postal Service utilizes a variety of robust measures, processes, and procedures to ensure the safe, secure, and timely delivery of our nation’s Election Mail, including ballots,"" Donahue said. ""The capture of mail piece images are not one of those standard measures, processes, or procedures.""
Experts told PolitiFact that the Postal Service works alongside election officials across the U.S. and has built on its experience and honed its processes over time. 
Michael Alvarez, political and computational social science at Caltech and co-director of the Caltech/MIT Voting Technology Project, said he has recently enabled webinar conversations with numerous election officials who’ve discussed mail ballots and the Postal Service.
During those discussions, those election officials raised ""no concerns"" about ""any changes in the USPS delivery of mail ballots,"" Alvarez said.
Our ruling
An X post said ""the United States Postal Service recently changed the delivery method of absentee mail-in ballots"" to hide ""the evidence of absentee mail-in ballot fraud.""
Close to Election Day, the Postal Service handles mailed ballots differently than other mail, but this procedure isn’t new. Election experts and a Postal Service spokesperson said that the agency has made similar changes to ensure prompt delivery of election mail in previous elections including in 2020 and 2022. 
A Postal Service spokesperson rebutted claims that the agency’s special measures for election mail signal fraud, saying that the measures intend to speed ballot mail delivery.
We rate these claims False.

In a Nov. 4 statement, the Kentucky State Board of Elections said neither it nor the state attorney general’s office had received any reports or complaints of mail-in absentee ballots or early in-person absentee ballots with preprinted marks in the candidate selection fields as of Nov. 4. Republican Secretary of State Michael G. Adams oversees the Board of Elections, which includes four Democratic and four Republican members.
""As no one has presented a pre-marked ballot to election administrators or law enforcement, the claim that at least one ballot may have had a pre-printed mark in Kentucky, currently only exists in the vacuum of social media,"" the board said in the statement. 
If a ballot did have the mark shown in the photo, it would be unlikely to be counted as a vote, state officials said. 
Whether tabulators would read the dot shown in the photo as a vote depends on the local equipment’s settings, Taylor Brown, the general counsel for the Kentucky State Board of Elections, said. Generally, Brown said, the machine settings would have to be very sensitive to detect a dot of that size.
Administrative rules in Kentucky define what types of marks constitute a vote, and a small dot is not among the definitions in the law.
If a ballot is flagged as having too many selections for one office — which is called an overvote — county officials also have leeway to determine voter intent. If a mail-in ballot had a full box filled in and a small dot in a different box, county officials could interpret the full box as the voter’s selection, Brown said.
""The law says the two selections have to be ‘similarly marked’ (to constitute an overvote), and a small, single dot is not recognized as one of the markings that constitutes a vote,"" Brown said.
Also, when voting by mail, if voters mark more than one candidate choice in ink, they can circle their preferred choice and the vote will be counted, the Kentucky board said. Mailed absentee ballots come with an instruction sheet that explains that process.
When voting in person, either early or on Election Day, Kentucky voters can choose to spoil their ballot and receive a new, clean ballot, up to two times. If a voter tries to cast a vote where more candidates are selected for an office than allowed, the ballot scanner will flag the ballot as including an overvote and the voter will be allowed to cast a new ballot.

By Sara Swann • January 21, 2025
Outside Kentucky, similar systems are in place to notify voters of an overvote and examine voter intent when counting votes. The 2002 Help America Vote Act requires that voting systems notify voters if they select more candidates than allowed and give them a chance to correct their ballots.
Each state has its own process for interpreting voter intent and scanning ballot selections, Amy Cohen, the executive director of the National Association of State Election Directors, told PolitiFact. In many states, if a ballot includes both a small mark and a selection box that’s fully filled in for the same office, the vote would be counted for the fully marked candidate.
Once a mail-in ballot is separated from its envelope, the voter is unknown, making it harder to rectify overvotes of mail-in ballots. Election workers look for discrepancies when they preprocess mail-in ballots, and they ""treat it in accordance with their jurisdiction’s procedures,"" Cohen said. 
If an overvote occurs and it is unclear which candidate the voter intended to select, no vote is counted for that office.

Facebook posts said If a ballot has a small dot in the box for Harris, ""any other box filled in, will be void."" 
Kentucky officials said they had received no reports or complaints of ballots with preprinted marks in the candidate selection fields as of Nov. 4.

This claim is unproven and is the subject of a defamation lawsuit. A judge fined the person who originally made the claim $1,000 a day for failing to produce evidence to corroborate the allegation. That fine is currently on hold pending an appeal.
‘The Dominion guy’
On Nov. 9, 2020, nearly a week after Election Day, Colorado conservative activist Joe Oltmann claimed he had been able to listen in on an ""antifa conference call"" before the election during which a man named Eric from Dominion promised Trump wouldn’t win. Oltmann referred to him as ""the Dominion guy.""
""They're talking on this call and he responds, and I'm paraphrasing this, right. ... ‘Don't worry about the election. Trump is not going to win. I made effing sure of that. Ha ha.’ And everyone's like, ‘Yeah.’ And then somebody else responds ‘effing right,’"" Oltmann said on his podcast, the Conservative Daily.
Trump allies and pro-Trump cable news networks such as One America News and Newsmax  amplified Oltmann’s claim.
PolitiFact has found no credible evidence that Dominion’s machines affected any vote tallies, and our reporting found Dominion Voting Systems was used only in a few counties that experienced minor problems which were quickly resolved. Those problems were the result of either human error or temporary malfunctions. Republicans and Democrats who run elections also say there was no vote-rigging using Dominion systems.
Dominion Voting Systems was the subject of many debunked claims during and after the 2020 election. The company won a $787 million settlement against Fox News for repeatedly airing the false claims.
Coomer’s past anti-Trump statements
Coomer, who was Dominion’s director of product strategy and security during the 2020 election, did post anti-Trump comments on his Facebook page in 2016. Oltmann found the comments and aired them on his podcast.
""I don’t give a damn if you're friend, family or random acquaintance,"" Coomer wrote in one post. ""(If you) pull the lever, mark an oval, touch the screen for that carnival barker ... UNFRIEND ME NOW.""
Coomer told The New York Times in 2021 that the Facebook posts were authentic. But he said he never participated in an antifa conference call and never said the things Oltmann claimed he did.

Coomer filed a defamation lawsuit against OItmann and others who amplified the claim.
Oltmann has yet to provide evidence about the ""antifa conference call"" or how he gained access to the meeting. He has never provided details about the person who gave him access to Coomer’s private Facebook account, USA Today reported in September.
Oltmann also has yet to provide any evidence corroborating that Coomer said the things Oltmann has claimed.

Rogan has not publicly declared support for Trump. In 2020, Rogan supported Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., for president. After it became clear Sanders would lose the primary to Joe Biden, Rogan said he would rather vote for Trump than Biden in 2020.

""FBI Report: Three affiliated groups were arrested for rigging early voting with mail-in ballots,"" said a Nov. 1 X post sharing the video. The X account was suspended Nov. 3. 
The 39-second video, which includes a seal in the upper right corner that says ""Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation,"" begins with a photo of the back of a purported FBI agent standing over a vehicle. 
The video’s narrator says, ""Three linked groups have been apprehended for rigging early voting by mail in ballot. List of names of recently deceased U.S. citizens and/or Americans aged 90 and over were used for electoral falsification."" 
The narrator says investigative journalist Eliot Higgins commented on the operation to the FBI. Higgins is founder of Bellingcat, an investigative journalism group.

Then the narrator attributes this statement to Higgins: ""We have seen this before in 2020. The FBI did a great job but that does not mean the election results will be transparent and honest. We don’t know how many such groups, acting on behalf of the Democrats, there are still in the United States."" 
Higgins told us via email that he didn’t say that.
Higgins also posted Nov. 2 on X, ""This is part of the Russian disinformation campaign that's published dozens, if not hundreds of videos making various false claims, along with fake ‘verified’ QR codes. All the views, (retweets), and likes you see on this post are inauthentic, all from for-hire bot networks the people running the campaign regularly use.""
Higgins wrote that while Russia has tried to influence the U.S. election, ""It's had zero impact on the election, and has just been a good way for some oligarch to make a bunch of money off his Russian government master.""
The FBI said in a Nov. 2 statement, ""The FBI is aware of two videos falsely claiming to be from the FBI relating to election security, one stating the FBI has apprehended three linked groups committing ballot fraud and a second relating to the Second Gentleman. These videos are not authentic, are not from the FBI and the content they depict is false.""
One sign that the video is fake: it lacks basic details such as where the alleged crime took place and how many rigged ballots were cast. It also plays on a common theme of election falsehoods that ballots were cast in the names of dead voters on a massive scale — which we have previously rated False. It also claims that such fraud is committed only by Democrats, which we also have rated False.
Russians have tried to influence the 2024 election
Groups that research fake videos and media outlets wrote that the videos the FBI warned about were manufactured by the Russians, however the U.S. federal government had not confirmed that as of midday Nov. 3.
The group Antibot4navalny, which investigates Russian disinformation, wrote Nov. 2 on X, ""We confidently attribute both of the videos referred to by @FBI as belonging to Matryoshka, a Russian state influence operation, which is ongoing since Sept 2023."" The account is manned by an anonymous group of volunteers and has been quoted by several mainstream news outlets in 2024 including The Associated Press, NBC News and The New York Times. The group’s name refers to Alexei A. Navalny, a Russian opposition leader who died in a Russian prison earlier this year.
BBC reported that the videos described by the FBI match those that are part of more than 300 that BBC has found since the start of 2024.
""The videos use convincing graphics and text to look like content from US government agencies as well as more than 50 news organisations — including the BBC, France 24 and Fox News,"" the BBC wrote. ""The videos have been posted online nearly every day for months and have recently focused on the US election, including clips promoting false claims about Harris and messages about unrest and ‘civil war.’""
CheckFirst, an online analytics company based in Finland, told the BBC that it linked the operation to Russia, tracking the network behind the videos to a Russian marketing agency and a Russian IP address. An Internet Protocol address is a numeric designation that identifies a device’s location on the internet.
