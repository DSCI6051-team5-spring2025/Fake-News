Such an egregious-sounding case of fraud sounds like a slam dunk for DOGE, but the department did not announce such a finding. A search of the post’s keywords — such as ""Louisiana,"" ""34"" and ""Social Security"" — on DOGE’s X account and website shows no post about a Louisiana man with 34 Social Security numbers collecting more than $1 million a year.

The account that shared the Threads post has also posted numerous anti-vaccine posts and others that falsely claim viruses don’t exist.
The Texas Department of State Health Services has issued news releases and public health alerts since Jan. 23, when it announced that two people in Houston’s Harris County who had traveled internationally were the first confirmed measles cases in Texas since 2023. Texas health officials say those two cases are unrelated to the West Texas outbreak, the bulk of which are in Gaines County.
The department on Feb. 26 announced the outbreak’s first death, a school-aged child who was not vaccinated. Of the 146 Texas measles cases, five were among people vaccinated for measles and the rest among people who were not vaccinated or whose statuses were unknown.
The Centers for Disease Control said as of Feb. 27 there were 164 measles cases in nine states — the agency is updating those totals every Friday. State public health department numbers were slightly higher, with 169 confirmed measles cases in nine states: Texas with 146, New Mexico with nine, California, Georgia and New Jersey with three each, New York City with two, and one each in Alaska, Kentucky and Rhode Island.
Kennedy spoke about the measles outbreak Feb. 26 to reporters at Trump’s first Cabinet meeting. The CDC said the U.S. has had three measles outbreaks this year and 16 in 2024. Kennedy said. ""It’s not unusual. We have measles outbreaks every year.""

A measles outbreak in Gaines County, Texas, was caused by “a public health initiative” to “distribute free measles vaccines.”
By Loreben Tuquero • February 28, 2025
There were 16 U.S. outbreaks in 2024, with 285 cases across 33 jurisdictions, CDC data shows. The Texas child’s death was the first in the U.S. since 2015. State data showed it came in a county with one of the state’s highest rates of school-aged children who received exemptions from receiving one or more required vaccines for reasons of conscience. About 91% of all U.S. children have been vaccinated. The World Health Organization said the virus killed about 107,500 people worldwide in 2023.
That the news outlets used stock images showing unidentifiable children with measles is not unusual, particularly when reporting on health issues in which live photos are rare.
USA Today, ABC News and NPR all used different stock images provided by Getty Images to illustrate stories about measles. It’s not clear where the Fox News images came from, but we found the two stock images seen in the Fox video on other websites.
When patients consent to be identified or photographed, news organizations are more likely to use those images in their coverage. None of the Texas measles victims in Texas have been identified by state officials due to privacy laws. People with measles also would likely be in quarantine at home or being treated in a hospital, not sharing their highly contagious disease with journalists.
Public health and medical websites often use stock photos, older unidentifiable medical photos, or clip art to illustrate stories about various diseases, rather than photos of currently ill people.
The claim that the use of these images in stories about a current outbreak proves that the outbreak is not real is nonsensical. We rate it Pants on Fire!",pants-fire,295732d79b1792436ffcfe87c3cd8ad2.jpeg

The post’s claim originated in a Feb. 17 article from The People’s Voice, a website known for spreading misinformation.
""There is no evidence that the measles vaccine can spread to other people. It is not contagious,"" Raul Andino-Pavlovsky, professor of microbiology and immunology at University of California, San Francisco, told PolitiFact.
What is measles and why is it on the rise?
Measles is a highly contagious viral infection that can cause fever, rash, coughing, ear infections, pneumonia and death. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes and is especially transmissible among children, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2000, measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. after more than a year without continuous spread, a development that health officials attributed to a highly successful vaccine campaign.
But large measles outbreaks can occur when the virus crosses borders and reaches unvaccinated or undervaccinated communities, the CDC said. Increasing vaccine hesitancy rates contribute to outbreaks. 
In late January, Texas reported two measles cases in Houston’s Harris County. The cases involved two people in the same household who had traveled internationally and were not vaccinated.
As of Feb. 28, the number of reported infections had increased to 155 across nine Texas counties and eastern New Mexico, including an unvaccinated school-aged child who died after being treated at a Lubbock, Texas, children’s hospital. Of the 146 Texas-only cases, five people were vaccinated. The rest were either classified as unvaccinated or their vaccination status was unknown, the Texas Department of State Health Services said.
Measles and vaccines in Gaines County
Gaines County’s case numbers led all the other counties with 98 — not ""200 or 300"" as the Facebook post said — a 1,533% rise from the six cases it reported Feb. 5. On Feb. 14, NBC News said health officials' estimated that another 200 to 300 people were infected across West Texas — not Gaines County alone — but haven’t been tested.
""There are people who are in the process of being tested and evaluated for measles in West Texas but there are not 200-300 people waiting on testing at this time,"" Lara Anton, Texas Department of State Health Services spokesperson, told PolitiFact in a Feb. 27 email. ""We expect that the number of cases will continue to increase because the virus is highly contagious and 90% of unvaccinated people will get it.""
Anton said the department does not provide counts of suspected cases.
Gaines County’s public schools last year had one of the state’s highest vaccine exemption rates, with more than 17% of its students citing reasons of conscience for not receiving one or more required vaccinations.
The People’s Voice cited South Plains Public Health District vaccination clinics held Feb. 6 and 7 in Gaines County.  On Feb. 5, the Texas state health department confirmed Gaines had six cases of measles, ""all among unvaccinated school-aged children.""

But there is no information that suggests such vaccines would accelerate infection spread — it curbs it. Claims otherwise stem from a misunderstanding of ""vaccine shedding."" The Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine is a two-dose attenuated (weakened) live virus vaccine. According to the CDC, the virus causes a harmless infection in the vaccinated person’s body that causes very few, if any, symptoms. The immune system responds to the infection and the body develops immunity. 
Although it is possible for vaccinated individuals to ""shed"" the virus in their urine and stool, experts told PolitiFact the measles vaccine would not transmit the disease to other people. Anton told NBC News that all samples tested in the outbreak were identified as a known wild measles strain, not a vaccine strain.
Paul Offit, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Vaccine Education Center director, said the measles vaccine virus is ""too attenuated to be passed from one person to the next.""
Matthew Washam, assistant professor at Ohio State University College of Medicine’s Department of Pediatrics and co-writer of a 2024 article about measles vaccine shedding in children, said vaccines don’t cause outbreaks as the post said. 
""This shedding is not contagious to others, and does not lead to measles outbreaks,"" he said.
Live virus vaccines are not recommended for all people. Cancer patients, for example, and others who are immunocompromised may not have the ability to fight the virus, even in the vaccine’s weakened form. 
Andino-Pavolvsky said a small number of people who receive the vaccine may develop mild rashes, but they would not be contagious and would pose no risk to others. Philip Keiser, a University of Texas Medical Branch global health professor, told PolitiFact there’s no scientific literature supporting the notion that a vaccine virus shed from someone who is vaccinated would be transmissible.
""The MMR vaccine (measles, mumps, and rubella) is the best and most reliable way to protect against these serious diseases,"" Andino-Pavolsky said. ""It has been widely studied and is considered one of the safest and most effective vaccines ever developed.""

Another bill would require school boards to adopt a policy by July 2026 that prohibits students from using cell phones during instructional time. 
At a Feb. 19, 2025, press conference before his bill passed the Assembly, state Rep. Joel Kitchens, a Republican from Sturgeon Bay, said ""90% of the (school) districts in Wisconsin already have a policy"" like the one the bill requires.
During floor debate on the bill, Democrats argued the bill would take away local control from school boards. Kitchens has pushed back on that idea.

""What we really need here is a unified approach,"" Kitchens said at the press conference. ""We are saying to the school districts that we’re standing with you on this, because everyone agrees this is a problem.""
The 90% figure caught our attention, especially when there’s so much debate over a policy that might already be par for the course in most school districts. 
Is it true that the vast majority of Wisconsin school districts already ban cellphones during class time? 
Let’s take a look.
90% figure comes from DPI survey of 320 school districts
PolitiFact Wisconsin reached out to Kitchens’ office to ask where the 90% number came from. They pointed us to the Department of Public Instruction’s testimony during a Feb. 11 public hearing for the bill. 
The department referenced its annual Digital Learning Survey. About 320 of the 421 public school districts in Wisconsin participated in the voluntary survey for the 2024-25 school year, officials said. 
Approximately 90% of districts that took part in the survey ""already have some sort of restrictive cellphone policy in place,"" according to the department. 
Fewer than 10% of districts did not have a cellphone policy and left it up to teachers to decide how to manage cell phone use in their classrooms, the survey found. 
While about a quarter of school districts did not participate in the survey, the 75% who did respond still represent the vast majority of districts in Wisconsin. 
Cellphone policies ‘vary significantly’ by school district 
While the 90% number is solid, it’s quite vague when referring to school districts having ""some sort of restrictive cellphone policy."" 
The results of the Digital Learning Survey drills down into that 90% number. Of that 90% total, about 26% of districts allow high school students to use cellphones in common areas but not classrooms.

About 44% of districts apply that policy for middle schoolers, along with high school students. And around 21% of districts have a full cellphone ban at all schools. 
In its testimony, DPI noted cellphone policies ""vary significantly.""
""In general, middle and high schools tend to have some form of restriction, while elementary schools usually enforce a ‘no phones during the day’ policy,"" DPI said.
The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel also reported a sampling of districts’ cellphone policies at the beginning of the 2024-25 school year. 
Some schools require students to place cellphones in caddies before the start of class. Many districts allow students to use devices outside of class, like during passing time and lunch.
The bill also requires cellphone policies to have exceptions, allowing students to use phones during emergencies and threats, for example, or to manage their health care.
Kitchens, in his own testimony, said the bill was written ""as open as possible"" and that each district will determine how to best restrict phones and enforce it. 
Our ruling
Kitchens said ""90% of the (school) districts in Wisconsin already have a policy"" that bans cellphones during instructional time. 
The Department of Public Instruction cited that 90% figure when testifying about Kitchens’ bill that would require districts to have that policy.
While specific policies vary by district, that 90% figure includes districts that either fully ban cellphones in schools or prohibit them in classrooms.

Setting aside the shaky logic of Musk hacking one precinct’s results in a blue state that Harris won by more than a million votes, it could seem jarring to see the Democratic candidate for president not win a single vote, even in a small precinct.
The screenshots showed accurate vote totals, but the results are not surprising or an example of hacking or fraud, experts told PolitiFact. They’re the result of a town with a large Orthodox and Hasidic Jewish population bloc voting in support of their rabbis’ endorsed candidates.

""This is not uncommon,"" Republican Jewish Coalition spokesperson Sam Markstein said. ""You can go back several years to presidential elections,"" and see similar results. 
A closer look at Rockland County’s election results show precinct 35 in Ramapo was not an aberration. Trump won 55.4% of the Rockland County vote, besting Harris by 17,663 votes.
In Ramapo, Trump won 80 of 122 precincts. Aside from precinct 35, Harris earned zero votes in four other Rockland County precincts: precinct 45 (Trump 90-0), precinct 84 (Trump 558-0), precinct 97 (Trump 494-0) and precinct 122 (Trump 23-0).
In several other precincts, Harris received one or single digit votes, while Trump got hundreds. In precinct 55, for example, Trump outpaced Harris, 986 to 2.
The 2024 Ramapo results mirrored its 2020 presidential vote. That year, Trump bested former President Joe Biden 528-0 in precinct 35. In the 2022 midterm elections, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul lost to her Republican opponent, Lee Zeldin, 408 to 24 in that same precinct, which also overwhelmingly voted to reelect Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., over his Republican opponent, Joe Pinion, 266 to 113.

Benjamin Rosenblatt, a New York elections data expert, said precinct 35 is in the village of Kaser, which is composed almost entirely of Hasidic Jews of the Viznitz sect. The village is surrounded by the hamlet of Monsey, which also has a huge Orthodox Jewish community, he said.
Rosenblatt said in Kaser, and other Orthodox and Hasidic Jewish communities in Rockland County, such as New Square, ""voters often vote as a bloc, to an extreme degree."" 
New Square has five voting precincts, including precinct 55, and across the five, voters chose Trump, 3,518 to 13.
The Jewish communities  ""will often vote nearly entirely for one candidate in each race, but may not vote for the same party in every race,"" Rosenblatt said in an email. ""For example, they may vote as a bloc for a Republican for President, but for a Democrat for State Senate or other local races.""
That’s what happened here, as well as in 2020 and in midterm elections, Rosenblatt said.

Ira Sheskin, a University of Miami professor who tracks the Jewish population in the U.S., said his data shows in 2023 Rockland County had 109,900 total Jewish residents. U.S. Census data shows there were 340,807 total residents in the county.
Rockland County Elections Commissioner Patricia Giblin said the precinct 35 election results reflect the area’s longstanding trends. The Orthodox Jewish population ""has consistently and overwhelmingly supported Republican candidates in the past elections,"" she said.
The Board of Elections ""thoroughly reviewed the results and confirmed no irregularities, fraud or hacking,"" Giblin said.
New York State Board of Elections spokesperson Kathleen McGrath told PolitiFact that state voting machines aren’t capable of connecting to the internet and couldn’t be hacked, as the social media posts claim.
Each ballot cast has a paper trail and all ballots are kept secure in a bipartisan manner, McGrath said. County election boards conduct mandatory post-election audits to confirm the results before certification, she said.
Voters can choose straight-ticket voting or choosing candidates for different parties, so ""claiming results of one race should be reflective of another race on the ballot are ill-founded,"" McGrath said.
Our ruling
Social media posts claim 2024 presidential election results in one Ramapo, New York, precinct — where Harris received zero votes — is proof that Musk hacked the vote count.
The precinct is in a heavily Orthodox Jewish area, where voters often vote as a bloc based on their rabbis’ endorsement. That’s likely what happened here, experts say, and previous elections showed similar patterns. Biden received zero votes in the precinct in 2020. 
A New York elections official said the state’s voting machines aren’t connected to the internet and can’t be hacked.

On Jan. 20, 2021, Biden revoked a permit for the Keystone XL oil and gas pipeline. The project would have extended the existing Keystone pipeline to run crude oil from Canada to Nebraska. 
Construction was underway, with Reuters reporting that the pipeline was about 8% built, when Biden’s order halted its progress. 
Some people lost their jobs.
One day after Biden revoked the permit, TC Energy — the company behind the project — ""let go 1,000 workers in both the U.S. and Canada,"" WorldOil reported. Reuters reported that TC Energy told employees by email that it would ""eliminate more than 1,000 construction jobs in coming weeks.""
That’s the clearest number of job cuts we could find immediately following Biden’s decision — 13,000 fewer than the Facebook posts’ claims. 
We didn’t find a CBS News ""60 Minutes"" segment specifically about the jobs cut after Biden revoked the Keystone XL pipeline permit (the Facebook post alludes to the show). But another CBS News show and other outlets, including Reuters, Verify and PolitiFact reported on the decision. 
Estimates vary on the number of jobs the Keystone XL pipeline would have created
A 2014 State Department report found that spending on the Keystone XL pipeline project construction ""would support approximately 42,100 jobs throughout the United States for the up to 2-year construction period.""
That doesn’t mean the pipeline construction would have created more than 42,000 new jobs, however. The report specified that the term ""support"" encompassed newly created jobs and maintaining ""existing jobs in current or new locations."" 
Pipeline spending would have supported 3,900 total ""direct, temporary construction"" jobs in states the pipeline ran through, the report said. And approximately 16,100 jobs would be ""direct jobs at firms that are awarded contracts for goods and services,"" including construction. 
The report said that 29% — or about 12,000 of the 42,100 jobs over two years — would have been in Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas. It didn’t specify where other jobs would have been located. 
The larger 42,100 total also included jobs supported by ""indirect"" and ""induced"" economic activity. Indirect economic activity refers to construction contractors’ purchases of goods and services, the report said. Induced economic activity occurs when construction workers and the people who provide goods and services to those workers spend what they’ve earned. The report listed money going to ""ranchers providing beef"" for construction workers as an example of induced economic activity. 
The economic analysis firm The Perryman Group’s 2010 pipeline economic impact analysis for TransCanada (now TC Energy) estimated that the Keystone XL pipeline project would have created about 59,500 jobs each year of construction.
Two subsequent analyses — one in 2011 by Cornell University’s Global Labor Institute and another in 2012 by Regional Economic Models, Inc. — criticized the Perryman report. 
Those analyses said the report overestimated the Keystone XL pipeline’s U.S. financial impact by including money spent outside the U.S. and reporting higher-than-average job wages. 
The Regional Economic Models, Inc., report estimated about 16,000 to 36,000 Keystone XL pipeline construction jobs in the U.S. each year for two years.

After construction, the pipeline wouldn’t have sustained many permanent jobs
The State Department’s 2014 report predicted that when the pipeline extension was completed and operational, it would require about 50 employees in the U.S., including 35 permanent employees and 15 temporary contractors. 
""This small number would result in negligible impacts on population, housing, and public services in the proposed Project area,"" it said. 
The 2011 Global Labor Institute report said that ""based on the figures provided by TransCanada for the Canadian section of the pipeline,"" new permanent ""pipeline jobs in the US number as few as 50.""
Our ruling
Facebook posts said Biden ""fired"" 14,000 Keystone XL pipeline workers ""on day one"" of his administration. 
On his first day in office, Biden revoked a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline’s construction. The next day, the company behind the project said it would eliminate about 1,000 jobs. 
Various estimates said the project would create or support thousands of temporary jobs, and once completed, require about 50 U.S. employees. 
There’s an element of truth — about 1,000 people lost their jobs — but we found no evidence that as many as 14,000 did.
We rate this claim Mostly False.

stated on February 24, 2025 in an interview on CNN:",“We've never audited government for 100 years.”,"stated on February 24, 2025 in an interview on CNN:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/feb/26/kevin-oleary/kevin-oleary-shark-tanks-mr-wonderful-says-no-gove/,N/A,"ABC’s ""Shark Tank"" star Kevin O’Leary said the federal government is ""all fat"" and said billionaire Elon Musk is ""not cutting enough.""  
In a Feb. 24 interview on CNN, O’Leary, a Canadian investor who calls himself ""Mr. Wonderful,"" said this about the federal government: ""One hundred years of never being scrutinized, never been examined, never looking for any efficiencies,"" he said. ""Finally, here's an individual who's willing to do it for free with extremely great executional skills.""
Since President Donald Trump tapped entrepreneur Elon Musk, he has been the public face of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The Tesla CEO, X owner and Trump campaign mega-donor went so far as to promote his cost-cutting efforts by wielding a chainsaw at a recent event.
When CNN host Laura Coates questioned the efficiency of what she called Musk’s ""thrash and burn"" approach, O’Leary said it isn’t possible to be surgically precise: ""You have to cut more because you just don't know. There's no way to do it. Remember, we've never audited government for 100 years.""
O’Leary is wrong. The federal government has conducted audits for decades, per federal law, and it has publicly shared the results. The Clinton-Gore administration also undertook a massive cost-cutting effort, but much of that followed congressional bipartisan approval.

""It is absurd to say that auditing has never happened,"" said Robin J. Kempf, an associate professor at University of Colorado, and a former inspector general for Kansas’ Medicaid program .
O’Leary did not respond to an inquiry for this fact-check.
Inspector generals routinely conduct audits, per federal law
In 1978, Congress passed the Inspector General Act in response to anti-corruption efforts that began after the 1972 Watergate break-in and cover-up that led to President Richard Nixon’s resignation. Agency inspectors general, from NASA to Homeland Security, were tasked with conducting independent and objective audits, investigations and inspections and with preventing and detecting waste, fraud and abuse.
Their findings are not secret. Inspectors general provide semiannual reports to Congress and immediately report to agency heads if they find egregious problems.
The Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency issued an annual report for 2023 that showed that work by inspectors general led to more than 4,000 prosecutions and identified nearly $93.1 billion in potential savings. 
The findings resulted in about 3,000 suspensions, reprimands and terminations for federal contractors and federal, state and local employees.
Trump fired 17 inspectors general during his first week in office. (He said he would install new ones.)
Separately, Congress in 1921 founded the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan, 3,000-employee investigative arm that examines the use of public funds, evaluates federal programs and policies, and undertakes other forms of federal oversight. (Until 2004 it was called the General Accounting Office.)
The office regularly produces reports on topics such as opioid addiction, affordable housing, and the federal response to COVID-19. On Feb. 25, the agency released its biennial High Risk List, which cited 38 areas of federal operations that have ""serious vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement, or in need of transformation.""
The agency says its efforts have produced nearly $759 billion in cumulative savings, or an average of $40 billion per year, over the past 19 years.
Congress also carries out oversight through its committees. These include making sure that federal programs are fulfilling their missions and working in a cost-effective and efficient manner, and investigating waste, fraud, and abuse. 
Government audits have found billions in fraud and suggested improvements
Here are a few audit findings in 2024:
COVID-19 recovery programs: The FBI wrote in January 2024 that the federal agencies found a combined $300 billion in fraud from pandemic recovery programs that  ""make the fraud the largest in history.""
Medicare, Medicaid, and other health and human services funds: The Department of Health and Human Services inspector general said in December 2024 that it had found $7 billion in expected recoveries resulting from investigations and audits conducted in 2024 and 1,548 criminal and civil enforcement actions. The inspector general posts its recommendations online, where they are publicly accessible.
Costs for lead service line replacement: The Environmental Protection Agency Office of Inspector General issued a report in October identifying nearly $1 billion in questionable costs and funds for lead service line replacement in the states. 
Audits are not only about money; some focus on how to improve federal agency’s missions. The inspector general audited the FBI’s counter terrorism program in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
Auditing experts said DOGE’s activities are different than typical government audits
Government auditing is highly structured and guided by standards for auditing and performance assessments established by the Government Accountability Office, Kempf said. 
""It is very focused on arriving at an independent assessment based on accuracy and a lack of bias,"" Kempf said. If Musk and DOGE are truly auditing, she said, ""we should be able to see the evidence that supports every conclusion and recommendation. There should be transparency.""

""None of that is happening with DOGE,"" she said.
DOGE has faced lawsuits alleging a lack of transparency. Although Musk said DOGE’s actions are ""maximally transparent,"" White House officials have resisted providing basic information for weeks, including disclosing who is DOGE’s administrator. A day after a judge questioned Justice Department attorneys about who is in charge, the White House told media outlets Feb. 25 that Amy Gleason is the acting administrator of the U.S. DOGE Service. Gleason is a career official who has worked under presidents of both parties.
Ryan McDonough, an assistant accounting professor at Rutgers University, told PolitiFact that he doesn’t believe DOGE is ""claiming to conduct audits in accordance with government auditing standards.""
O’Leary in the CNN interview invoked a different model: the private equity playbook for cutting expenses by cutting ""deep"" and ""fast"" and then hiring back.
But this misses an important distinction: Unlike companies, which have a profit motive, the government isn’t a for-profit business. Although efficiency is important, its primary mission is to provide public services and deliver equal treatment to citizens. 
""One can always learn from other institutional arrangements, and private equity is good at cutting redundancy, focused on value creation,"" said Shivaram Rajgopal, an accounting and auditing professor at Columbia Business School.
Rajgopal said such a model has ""some value"" for government auditing, but ""moving fast and breaking things is not a great recipe for government, in my view.""
Our ruling
O’Leary said, ""we've never audited government for 100 years.""
For decades, inspectors general have audited the federal government, looking for waste, fraud and abuse. Their findings are public and accessible online.
O’Leary left people with the impression that the federal government hasn’t been audited for a century. That’s ridiculously wrong.

The claim stems from a $2 billion Environmental Protection Agency grant that went to Power Forward Communities, a coalition of clean energy groups, including one in which Abrams previously was a senior counsel. The grant, which the EPA awarded under then-President Joe Biden, will fund energy efficient housing projects around the country. There’s no evidence Abrams directly received any of the grant money or engaged in illegal behavior.

Power Forward Communities consists of Rewiring America, Enterprise Community Partners, Local Initiatives Support Corporation, United Way, and Habitat for Humanity International. The group formed in 2023 to apply for the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy funding.
Abrams, an attorney, joined Rewiring America, one of the coalition’s members, in March 2023 as a senior counsel. Abrams did not have a role at Power Forward Communities beyond her position at Rewiring America, her spokesperson Joshua Karp said. She left Rewiring America at the end of 2024.
In October 2023, shortly after Rewiring America announced Power Forward Communities’ creation, Abrams said in an X post she was ""Thrilled to be part of (Rewiring America) and the Power Forward Communities coalition.""
Power Forward Communities and Rewiring America declined to comment on the record. Power Forward Communities CEO Tim Mayopoulos told Politico Abrams was not paid by Power Forward Communities. 
""Stacey Abrams has not received a penny of this EPA grant,"" Mayopoulos said in the Feb. 24 Politico article. ""It was never the plan for her to receive any money from this grant. Power Forward Communities has no relationship with Ms. Abrams, other than the fact that she’s one of the people who have advised one of our coalition members in the past.""
The $2 billion grant to Power Forward Communities was part of $20 billion in funding the EPA announced in April 2024. The funding came from the National Clean Investment Fund, part of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which was created under the Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2022 by congressional Democrats. 
An April 4, 2024, release about Power Forward Communities’ award said the coalition’s members would draw on their experience ""to build and lead a national financing program providing customized and affordable solutions for single-family and multi-family housing owners and developers.""
Power Forward Communities was one of three groups chosen for awards under the National Clean Investment Fund after a competitive review process, the EPA said at the time, that included reviews from dozens of federal employees and scoring of applications by expert review panels. The EPA advertised the plan for the program that funded Power Forward Communities in 2023, indicating it intended to choose two or three national nonprofits to partner with local organizations to deliver the funding.

""I am not making this up: Republicans have introduced legislation… to increase your bank fees,"" Buttigieg said in a Feb. 18 X post. 
Buttigieg pointed to joint resolutions proposed by Rep. French Hill of Arkansas and Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, both Republicans, who chair their chambers’ banking committees. The resolution, which collectively has 25 other Republican co-sponsors, would overturn a recent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule that would cap overdraft charges from large banks and credit unions at $5 unless banks offered the service as a regulated loan.
Overdraft protection is a service many banks offer to cover purchases that cost more than an account’s balance. Customers are generally charged an overdraft fee in addition to paying back the original purchase price. 
If the rule goes into effect on Oct. 1 as it's scheduled to, overdraft fees would be capped at lower levels than what some banks typically charge now. Conversely, if the Republican legislation passes, overdraft fees at some banks would not decrease as they would have if the regulation took effect. The Republican resolution would keep the status quo and not increase current overdraft fees. 
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
Banking groups and the resolution’s supporters have called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s rule an overreach that will hurt competition and limit options for consumers, including people who don’t have access to other credit lines. The Consumer Bankers Association has said its members would likely restrict the amount of overdraft services provided if a cap were enacted. 
A Buttigieg spokesperson declined to comment on the record.
What would the overdraft rule do?
The rule limiting overdraft fees was issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal watchdog agency that protects consumers from unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. President Donald Trump’s administration has targeted the agency for cuts, and the administration said it will continue to operate in a streamlined fashion.
The rule would require banks and credit unions with more than $10 billion in assets that offer overdraft protection to choose one of the following actions: 
Cap overdraft fees at $5 per transaction.
Set an overdraft fee that’s equal to the cost of offering the service.
Continue offering higher overdraft fees as a regulated loan, giving customers the choice to open a line of credit and providing disclosures on the loan’s terms.
Overdraft fees had been trending downward for years, with fee revenue falling by about half since 2019, but fees began ticking up slightly in 2024. A Bankrate survey found the 2024 average overdraft fee was about $27.08, slightly higher than 2023’s average of $26.61. Some banks do not charge anything for overdraft protection, but 94% of accounts are at banks that charge overdraft fees, Bankrate said.
Banking groups sued the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in December over the overdraft protection rule, saying the agency overstepped its authority and the regulation would hurt consumers who don’t have access to other lines of credit. The rule’s critics said banks would have to raise fees elsewhere to make up for the lost income. 
Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center, a legal advocacy nonprofit that has supported the rule, said overdraft fees are effectively high-interest loans without some of the reporting and repayment regulations loans are subject to.
""They are allowed to charge these high fees and engage in a whole bunch of manipulative practices to push people into overdrafting because they’re not complying with federal law that governs loans,"" Saunders said. 
Banks must disclose their overdraft fees and policies according to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau policies, and customers must opt in to overdraft protection services. But the fees are exempt from some of the regulations governing other loans under the Truth In Lending Act.
Would the proposed legislation increase bank fees? 
The legislation is a tool Congress can use under the Congressional Review Act to overturn federal agency rulemaking. The joint resolution says Congress disapproves of the final rule and blocks the rule from taking effect. To become law, it requires approval by majorities in both chambers of Congress and the president’s signature. 
If the resolution becomes law, banks could continue charging current fees or increase them if they choose.
If the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule takes effect, banks could lower their overdraft fees, offer higher fees with more regulations or no longer offer overdraft protection.

When we asked Hill, the House Financial Services Committee chair, for a response to Buttigieg’s claim, Hill’s spokesperson pointed us to Hill’s interview with an Arkansas TV news station. Hill said in the interview he thinks consumers who overdraft their accounts out of necessity would be negatively affected by the rule. He said the rule could push some banks to stop offering overdraft protection or raise prices for other services. 
""If I can’t charge a reasonable return for this service, for this convenience, then I won’t offer it. Or I’ll raise prices somewhere else,"" he said.
Other trade groups have also argued the Biden-era rule would push banks to raise fees elsewhere. In a comment submitted to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau about the overdraft protection rule, America’s Credit Unions said that rule and others would incentivize credit unions to raise monthly checking and savings account fees and increase loan and credit card interest rates. 
Regulations on fees would mean ""no more free checking accounts, more expensive loan products, and less staff available for that individual support that is critical for so many credit union members,"" America’s Credit Unions Chief Advocacy Officer Carrie Hunt said in the letter. 
Saunders said higher monthly account fees are unlikely because competition among banks would keep account fees low. 
Our ruling
Buttigieg said Republicans introduced legislation ""to increase your bank fees."" 
The legislation would overturn a federal rule scheduled to go into effect Oct. 1 that would cap overdraft fees at $5 or require banks to offer overdraft protection as a regulated loan. The Republican resolution would not increase current overdraft fees. 
The resolution is not widely applicable to banking fees; it applies to a single type of banking transaction that only applies to people who overdraw their bank accounts — about 25% of U.S. households.
The statement contains an element of truth because if the federal rule that Republicans are proposing to eliminate were to go into effect, overdraft fees would decrease at some banks. But it’s a stretch to say that overturning a rule that hasn’t been implemented represents a cost increase for consumers.

Any plan to provide stimulus checks to Americans would need congressional approval, as was the case for the stimulus checks approved during the COVID-19 pandemic.
James Fishback, CEO and cofounder of investment firm Azoria Partners, which has held events at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, proposed the plan Feb. 14 on X and tagged Musk.
""American taxpayers deserve a ‘DOGE Dividend’: 20% (of) the money that DOGE saves should be sent back to hard-working Americans as a tax refund check,"" Fishback wrote. ""At $2 trillion in DOGE savings and 78 million tax-paying households, this is a $5,000 refund per household, with the remaining used to pay down the national debt.""
However, it’s unclear whether DOGE will save enough money to make this proposal feasible.

The list of government contracts and real estate DOGE says it’s canceled amount to about $8.6 billion in savings. DOGE has not accounted for the remaining $46.4 billion.
The savings so far are a long way from DOGE’s initial goal of cutting $2 trillion from the federal government’s budget, which totaled $6.8 trillion last fiscal year. Musk said in January that $2 trillion was a ""best-case outcome,"" and there was a ""good shot"" at achieving $1 trillion in savings.

stated on February 20, 2025 in a Senate floor speech:",“The single biggest driver of our national debt since 2001 has been Republican tax cuts.”,"stated on February 20, 2025 in a Senate floor speech:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/feb/25/patty-murray/are-republican-tax-cuts-the-single-biggest-driver/,N/A,"During a Senate floor debate over a budget resolution that could tee up President Donald Trump’s fiscal policies, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., warned her colleagues to proceed with caution before approving tax cuts for wealthier Americans.
The Republican budget resolution being debated, Murray said Feb. 20, is ""not about balancing the budget. We all know that. Because they don’t plan to reverse one of the biggest drivers of the debt: Republican tax cuts. Despite all the boogeymen the Republicans like to point to as driving the national debt, the reality is that the single biggest driver of our national debt since 2001 has been Republican tax cuts.""
Murray is accurate when it comes to tax cuts and the federal debt, but she’s wrong to assert that Republicans acted alone. 
A 2024 analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscally hawkish group, found that tax cuts were the biggest of four types of legislation that have added to the federal debt since 2001. Two other types of legislation trailed close behind tax cuts in fiscal impact: large stimulus bills and annual spending increases.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
However, the tax cuts were enacted not only by Republicans; when the laws were extended, much of the debt they spurred was also ratified by congressional Democrats, President Barack Obama, or both. In fact, of five tax cut bills enacted since 2001, Murray ended up voting for two, the first directly and the second by not objecting to the unanimous consent motion.
Tax cuts rank first among factors contributing to the debt since 2001
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget analysis examined legislation enacted since 2001 that had the biggest impacts on the federal government’s bottom line. The analysis did not factor in additional spending for mandatory programs such as Social Security because they were authorized before the 2001 cutoff.
The report broke down the new fiscal burdens into four broad categories: 
The biggest category was tax cuts, at $8.4 trillion. These included revenue losses caused by the passage of major tax bills in 2001, 2003, 2010, 2013 and 2017.
Next was stimulus spending totaling $6.8 trillion, to counter the 2007-2009 Great Recession, and to ease the economic fallout beginning in 2020 from the coronavirus pandemic.
In third place was $5.9 trillion in new spending to keep the government running, enacted outside of major stimulus packages, typically through annual bills
The final piece was $1.1 trillion in Medicare expansion, notably the 2003 creation of the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit. 
By this accounting, tax cuts accounted for a plurality, though not a majority, of the new debt created. The difference between first and second place was modest. 
Are the tax cuts solely because of Republicans?
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s analysis looked at whether the laws in question were passed by overwhelmingly partisan margins in Congress:
Republican President George W. Bush signed the 2001 tax law and it received near-unanimous Republican backing. But it also attracted a dozen Democratic votes in the Senate and 28 in the House. 
Bush also signed the 2003 tax law; this measure received only two Democratic votes in the Senate and seven in the House.
Democratic President Barack Obama signed the 2010 tax law after its passage in the Senate by an 81-19 bipartisan margin and in the House by a 277-148 vote that included 139 Democratic and 138 Republican votes in favor.
Obama also signed the 2013 tax law, after its passage in the Senate by unanimous consent, meaning no objections from any member of either party, and in the House with more Democrats voting in favor than Republicans.
Trump signed the 2017 tax law. Democrats did not vote for the bill in either the House or  Senate. 
In other words, Bush’s 2003 tax law and Trump’s 2017 tax law were clearly Republican-backed bills without significant Democratic support, and Bush’s 2001 tax law was substantially, although not entirely, supported by Republicans.

But two of the five laws, in 2010 and 2013, were signed by Obama and supported by a broad swath of Democrats in both chambers.
The 2010 and 2013 laws related to extending tax laws that originated under Bush. 
In a statement, Murray’s office told PolitiFact that the 2010 and 2013 laws were ""technically bipartisan"" but added that ""context is badly needed.""
""Democrats did not want to extend tax cuts for the wealthiest,"" Murray’s office said in a statement. 
The negotiations for the 2010 tax bill occurred during the Great Recession, and the 2013 bill negotiations occurred before key expirations of laws, known as a ""fiscal cliff."" The looming expirations gave Republicans leverage to include higher-income taxpayers as beneficiaries of the legislation, against Democratic wishes. 
Still, many congressional Democrats, and Obama, did move to extend tax laws that originated under Bush, effectively buying into their provisions. Murray ended up voting for both the 2010 and 2013 bills, the first directly and the second by not objecting to the unanimous consent motion.
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that in general, lawmakers expressed bipartisan support for the tax bills passed since 2001 and for the stimulus bills, the annual spending increases and the Medicare expansions.
The statement from Murray’s office said, ""Democrats strongly and emphatically opposed new tax cuts for the wealthy few — the bipartisan extension of those cuts was only accomplished as a part of tough negotiations with Republicans who in 2010 held tax cuts for middle-class families hostage during an economic crisis, and in 2012 leveraged a fiscal cliff to force the extension of these tax cuts. They are tax cuts initiated and passed by Republicans—they were also tax cuts protected by Republicans during bipartisan negotiations. The Republicans, not Democrats, own the tax cuts.""
Our ruling
Murray said, ""The single biggest driver of our national debt since 2001 has been Republican tax cuts.""
A 2024 Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget analysis found that tax cuts were the biggest of four types of legislation that have added to the debt since 2001. Two other types of legislation trailed close behind in impact: large stimulus bills and annual spending increases.
However, the committee concluded that several of these tax cut bills also had Democratic buy-in from Congress or the president, or both, undercutting Murray’s assertion that Republicans acted unilaterally to pass the tax cuts. In fact, of five tax cut bills enacted since 2001, Murray ended up voting for two, the first directly and the second by not objecting to the unanimous consent motion.

The winner will determine whether the ideological tilt of the court will remain skewed liberal, which has been the case since the election of Justice Janet Protasiewicz in 2023, or if it will return to a conservative majority, as it had been for 15 years prior.

""To all the Milwaukee Brewers fans who live in Wisconsin: The Chicago Cubs owner is bankrolling Brad Schimel,"" the post reads. ""Vote accordingly."" 
We periodically look at claims related to politics that are circulating on social media. So, is the owner of the Cubs really bankrolling Schimel’s campaign? 
Let’s take a look. 
Big donors give money to state parties, which transfer to candidates 
We’ll get the baseball trivia out of the way first. The Ricketts family, headed by billionaire businessman Joe Ricketts, owns the Cubs. Joe’s son Tom is the team’s chairman. 
A look at Schimel’s publicly available campaign finance reports does not show the Ricketts in his list of donors. 
So what gives? The explanation requires some knowledge of campaign finance law in Wisconsin over the past decade. 
The state’s campaign finance laws cap the amount that a person can give to a Supreme Court candidate to $20,000. But under a change the Republican-controlled Wisconsin Legislature made in 2015, political parties can receive unlimited donations, which they can funnel to their preferred candidates. (That change has ultimately benefited Democrats more because they have been able to raise more money.) 
A review of the Republican Party of Wisconsin’s campaign finance reports shows a Jan. 27, 2025 donation from Joe Ricketts of $500,000. After receiving this and other large donations from wealthy individuals, Republican party officials transferred nearly $1.7 million in three donations to Schimel’s campaign. 
It’s illegal for a donor to give to the party and say they expect it to flow to a certain candidate, meaning it’s impossible to definitively prove that Ricketts’ money was for Schimel. 
Still, this practice has become a tried-and-true way for donors to get around individual contribution limits — so much so that Schimel encouraged people to do it.  
At a Calumet County Republican Party event last July, Schimel urged those who could afford to give more than $20,000 to give to the state party instead, the Journal Sentinel previously reported, suggesting any money given after the Nov. 5, 2024 election would be transferred to him.
""If you want to give a lot more, you can give that to either of the state parties, and they can transfer it,"" he said. ""They can transfer that to candidates.""

By Sofia Ahmed • January 30, 2025
(The Wisconsin Democracy Campaign filed an ethics complaint in early February over this remark and others by Schimel, who is prohibited by law from personally soliciting campaign donations.)
The state Democratic Party has also made use of this playbook. In January, they received $1 million from billionaire George Soros; $500,000 from Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker; $490,000 from Milwaukee philanthropist Lynde Uihlein; $470,000 from retired software engineer Gloria Page, the mother of Google co-founder Larry Page; and $250,000 from LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. Weeks after receiving those donations, they transferred $2 million in three donations to Crawford’s campaign. 
Now, for the nitty-gritty: the X post claims Ricketts is ""bankrolling"" Schimel. The dictionary definition of bankroll is ""to supply money for,"" but it’s worth noting that Ricketts is not supplying the majority of the funds in this extraordinarily expensive race. 
ABC Supply owner Diane Hendricks gave $970,000 to the state Republican party in January, and Uline president Liz Uihlein gave $650,000. Even groups backed by Elon Musk have dropped a few million on TV ads and increasing voter turnout for Schimel. 
All told, spending on this election is expected to outpace spending on Wisconsin’s last Supreme Court election in 2023, which totaled more than $56 million and shattered national spending records. 
Our ruling 
A post on social media claimed Chicago Cubs owner Joe Ricketts is bankrolling Schimel. 
A review of campaign finance records shows Ricketts gave a large sum to the state GOP, which has alongside Democrats transferred money to preferred candidates in a well-known workaround of individual contribution limits — something Schimel has acknowledged outright. 
Thus, the claim is largely accurate, though it’s missing the context of that workaround, which means we can’t know with complete certainty that Ricketts intended the money for Schimel. 
Our definition of Mostly True is a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

A White House official told PolitiFact in an email that the Eagles did not reject an invitation, pointing us to an X post from conservative commentator Clay Travis, who said the White House had not yet sent an invitation.
Kelly backtracked in a reply to her X post after hearing of the White House’s denial, writing, ""Could be (hopefully?) fake news!""
The Eagles didn’t immediately return a request for comment. There is no statement on the team’s social media accounts or website about accepting or rejecting a White House invite, and we did not find examples of team spokespeople addressing the possibility in news coverage.
The claims stem from an article dated Feb. 9, the day of the Super Bowl, in the U.S. Sun, the digital U.S. edition of the British tabloid newspaper. A story labeled, ""SUPER SNUB"" said that discussions before the game between players and the front office ""resulted in a ‘massive no’ when asked if they would accept an invitation to the nation’s capital.""
Eagles player Lane Johnson, the team’s captain and offensive right tackle, told the website Sportico Feb. 10 that a decision to visit the White House would be ""a team decision.""

It’s possible the Eagles may turn down a White House invite, if and when it’s offered, as the team and Trump, who predicted a Chiefs victory in the Super Bowl, have a history.
In 2018, Trump said he canceled a visit by the Eagles after their Super Bowl win over the New England Patriots, writing on X that ""only a small number of players decided to come."" He said it was related to Eagles players kneeling during the national anthem.
ESPN reported in 2018 that team owner Jeffrey Lurie, former head coach Doug Pederson and a handful of Eagles players were planning to attend. Most of the team’s Black players planned to skip the visit, ESPN said, quoting unnamed sources.
It’s possible the team had reached an internal decision on how to respond to a Trump White House invite, but the team has not publicly shared that. And the White House said an invitation hasn’t been sent.
We will continue to monitor the situation. But so far, claims that the Eagles declined a White House invitation seem premature. We rate them False.",false,7af26604f41dd25e1dfc62241387788f.jpeg

Some social media videos would have you believe that Musk, who’s leading President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, is using savings from federal government cuts and giving it back to Americans in a most unusual way.
""Elon Musk is a man of his word. He’s contracted a helicopter and the first DOGE payments are being rained on California,"" a narrator in a Feb. 23 Facebook video said.
The video has text that said, ""It rained money on a busy highway,"" ""Raining Cash!"" and ""California!""

But there has been no official word that Trump’s administration will return money saved by DOGE back to taxpayers, much less in a game-show like fashion from a helicopter. 
And upon a closer look, the video is an edited version of two videos taken before DOGE was even a gleam in Trump’s or Musk’s eyes.
(Screenshot from Facebook)
Trump floated a proposal to give a dividend of 20% from DOGE savings — or $5,000 if it reaches its target of $2 trillion in savings — to taxpayers. How much taxpayer money DOGE is saving is not clear. PolitiFact reported Feb. 21 that DOGE’s website touted $55 billion in savings, but its ""wall of receipts"" total about $8.6 billion. So far, no money has been returned to taxpayers.
We also wondered why the first batch of millions would go to California. Trump and Musk have publicly feuded with California’s Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom after deadly wildfires there last month.
Using a reverse image search, we found the Facebook post used real video footage, but both predate the existence of DOGE.

Janice Okubo, a health department spokesperson, told PolitiFact that birth certificates evolve over the decades, and there are no doubt differences between what Obama’s looked like when he was born and the documents issued today. 
And if there was a plot to forge a birth certificate so that Obama could run for office, it went back decades — to the month he was born in 1961. 
Will Hoover, who wrote a 2008 story for the Honolulu Advertiser about Obama’s childhood in Hawaii, told PolitiFact that he reviewed microfilm archives and found two birth announcements for Obama. One was in the Honolulu Advertiser on Aug. 13, 1961, and the other was in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin the next day. They both said the same thing: ""Mr. and Mrs. Barack H.

In a Feb. 20 interview, Newsmax host Rob Schmitt asked, ""You think they were creating a new voter class? You think that was the goal when they opened up the borders for four years?""
Musk said Biden had a political incentive to ""maximize"" people in the country illegally.
""That is why the Biden administration was pushing to get in as many illegals as possible and spend every dollar possible to get as many, because every one of them is a customer,"" Musk said. ""Everyone's a voter. The whole thing was a giant voter importation scam.""
Musk, now involved with President Donald Trump’s commission to cut government spending, repeated falsehoods he spread early in the 2024 election year that Biden had an election strategy to import voters through illegal immigration. We emailed the White House press office asking for evidence and did not hear back.

Biden stepped up immigration enforcement during the election year
There were historically high levels of illegal immigration during the Biden administration, but there is no evidence that Biden ""imported"" those people to become voters. Factors such as natural disasters and economic or political turmoil in a persons’ home country lead people to migrate.
Additionally, Musk’s statement ignored that the Biden administration removed and deported immigrants in the U.S. illegally, and it stepped up efforts in 2024 as he ran for reelection. (He dropped out in July.)
The Biden administration removed, returned or expelled more than 4.5 million people from February 2021, Biden’s first full month in office, to November 2024, the latest month with available data.
Illegal immigration has generally dropped since March 2024, and it dropped significantly after June, when Biden implemented a policy limiting people’s ability to apply for asylum at the southwest border. For example, there were more than 137,000 southwest border encounters in March 2024 and 47,000 in December. 
""Biden was trying to deport as many border crossers as he could, so I don’t see any evidence he wanted these people in the United States,"" said David Bier, an immigration expert at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""He campaigned as being anti-illegal immigration. He never courted their votes, and he could not court their votes because they cannot vote and do not vote. Saying ‘every one of them was a voter’ is as divorced from reality as anything you could possibly say.""
It takes several years for immigrants to become citizens
Federal law requires U.S. citizenship to vote in national elections, and would-be voters sign a form that attests under penalty of perjury that they are citizens when they register to vote. 
The citizenship process takes several years. 
""It takes on average five years in green card status before a person can become a U.S. citizen, so no one would instantly gain the right to vote,"" Michelle Mittelstadt, a spokesperson for the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, previously told PolitiFact.
Musk acknowledged at CPAC that it might take years for immigrants to gain citizenship, but it would be ""an investment that is guaranteed to pay off.""
Immigrants who arrive illegally have higher hurdles to clear before becoming citizens and voting. The Biden administration failed in its efforts to pass a law with a pathway to citizenship, and no such legislation is expected during the Trump administration.
Which party would have the ‘immigrant’ advantage?
There is no guarantee that immigrants who become citizens will vote, or vote for Democrats. Although the southwest border gets the most attention, immigrants who come illegally are not from Latin America only.
Mike Madrid, a Republican strategist in California and author of the book ""The Latino Century,"" said Republicans won the largest national Hispanic vote share in 2024 than in presidential elections in recent cycles.

The U.S. House Select Committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol “deleted and destroyed all of the information that they collected over two years.”
By Samantha Putterman • January 24, 2025
Immigrants, including Hispanics, view the Republican Party as focused on economic issues and the Democratic Party as focused on cultural issues, Madrid said.
The New York Times documented a conservative shift among immigrants after the 2020 election. Its analysis of voting in 28,000 precincts in more than 20 cities found that immigrant-dense neighborhoods with large populations of Latinos and residents of Asian descent had a surge in turnout and shifted to the right. 
""There is zero evidence that immigration has harmed Republican Party prospects,"" Bier previously told us. 
Eligible naturalized citizens comprise about 10% of voters, Pew Research Center found in 2024. 
Voting by noncitizens is rare
There are incidents of noncitizens voting in elections, but they are sporadic among millions of votes cast in federal elections. Immigrants who cross the border illegally are typically looking for jobs and many are escaping poverty or crime — most don’t want to risk drawing government authorities’ attention by casting a ballot.
Voting by noncitizens carries high risks that include deportation if they are here illegally or incarceration. Fraudulent voter registration or voting by noncitizens often results from misunderstandings or errors. For example, some noncitizens accidentally register to vote when applying for a driver’s license.
Our ruling
Musk said Biden’s immigration policy was ""a giant voter importation scam.""
There is no evidence that the Biden administration was bringing in people illegally to cast votes. Government data shows more than 4.5 million removals, returns and expulsions during Biden’s tenure. Biden stepped up these actions during the election year.
It takes several years for immigrants to become citizens and therefore eligible to vote. Immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally cannot vote and would have to overcome hurdles to become citizens.

PolitiFact encontró un video en Instagram de Espaillat junto al periodista Adalberto Dominguez donde el congresista dice, ""Esta es la bandera original que diseñó Juan Pablo Duarte en República Dominicana"".
Duarte fundó el movimiento La Trinitaria el 16 de julio de 1838, liderando la lucha por la independencia de República Dominicana de Haití. 
El presidente del Instituto Duartiano en la República Dominicana, una institución que difunde la historia de Duarte le dijo a Listín Diario, un periodico dominicano, que la bandera que Espaillat sostuvo no es de La Trinitaria. 
""Bueno no hay duda, la diferencia entre la bandera haitiana, verdad y esa que presentaron es una leve cruz que aparece y unas estrellas, pero en esencia esa es más la bandera haitiana"", dijo el Dr. Wilson Gómez Ramírez, presidente del instituto, el 19 de febrero.
PolitiFact envió correos electrónicos y llamó a las oficinas de Espaillat, pero no recibimos respuesta.
De que se trataba el evento que atendió Espaillat
Espaillat, nació en la República Dominicana y llegó a Estados Unidos cuando tenía 10 años con su familia. Él es el primer congresista de ascendencia dominicana en servir en el Congreso de Estados Unidos.
Espaillat organizó el séptimo evento consecutivo anual, Dominicans on the Hill (Dominicanos en el Capitolio), el 11 de febrero. Este evento conmemoró la cultura dominicana, sus logros como diáspora en EEUU y dialogó sobre cómo resolver los problemas que están afectando a sus comunidades.  
¿Qué bandera sostuvo Espaillat en el evento?
La Dra. Mónica Espaillat Lizardo, profesora asistente de historia en la Universidad Estatal de Arizona, le dijo a PolitiFact que la bandera que sostenía Espaillat es una bandera que por mucho tiempo ha sido asociada con La Trinitaria. 
""Creo que lo que más importa aquí es que, irónicamente, la bandera que exhibió Espaillat es en realidad una bandera histórica asociada con el objetivo de separación entre Occidente y Oriente: los países de Haití y lo que se convertiría en la República Dominicana"", dijo Espaillat Lizardo.
Ella añadió que la bandera de La Trinitaria, así como la primera bandera izada en el este para anunciar el establecimiento de la nación dominicana en febrero de 1844, se inspiraron en la bandera haitiana.
""La bandera es la bandera trinitaria, la bandera del movimiento político que se unió para crear la República Dominicana"", también nos dijo la Dra. Saudi García, directora de In Cultured Company, una organización comprometida a crear igualdad entre dominicanos y haitianos. 
Espaillat Lizardo le dijo a PolitiFact que no hay evidencia histórica disponible que definitivamente apoya que la bandera que sostuvo Espaillat fue la bandera de La Trinitaria o que Duarte diseñó esa bandera. 
Pero tampoco es ""una nueva bandera creada ‘fusionista’ como se ha dicho en los medios"", Espaillat Lizardo dijo.

Ella añadió que ""Ningún documento histórico de puño y letra de Duarte confirma que fue el autor y diseñó la bandera Trinitaria o la primera bandera de la República Dominicana"". 
La bandera actual de la República Dominicana ondeó por primera vez el 27 de febrero de 1844, día de la Independencia Nacional y se adoptó como símbolo de la patria el 6 de noviembre de 1844.
¿Por qué es controversial que Espaillat haya mostrado una bandera que se parece a la de Haití?
Desde el siglo XV, la isla La Española fue colonizada por España en su parte oriental y la parte occidental estuvo bajo dominio francés. En 1804, la parte occidental, ahora Haití, se independizó, y el resto de la isla siguió gobernada por España hasta 1821. Haití ocupó el territorio oriental el 9 de febrero de 1822, por 22 años. 
En 1844, la sociedad secreta, La Trinitaria, liderada por Duarte, independizó a la República Dominicana de Haití.
Eventualmente, Haití se convirtió en el país más pobre de América, haciendo que miles de haitianos buscaran estabilidad política y económica en su país vecino. Esto llevó a más tensión entre los países y género políticas migratorias contra los haitianos.

Espaillat no mostró una nueva bandera para la República Dominicana.

There’s no evidence the Department of Government Efficiency has saved the U.S. government $64 billion or more. In fact, DOGE’s website reports a much lower number, not all of which is accounted for.
What does USDebtClock.org tell us?
The social media posts pointed to the website, ""USDebtClock.org,"" which claims to track the U.S. national debt and other economic and government data. The website was registered in November 2008 by a company that keeps registrants’ names private. Internet Archive shows the page has existed since at least December 2008.
Among the website’s many colorful boxes of rapidly increasing numbers is a golden box labeled ""D.O.G.E. Clock."" The Internet Archive shows this supposed government savings tracker was added to the website Jan. 20, the day Trump took office.
On Feb. 21, one month into Trump’s second term, the DOGE Clock showed a total of $121 billion saved and counting. But the U.S. Debt Clock website doesn’t explain how it arrived at this number or who is maintaining the site — and its figures don’t align with what DOGE itself has described.
The debt clock site’s about page says it is not associated with any U.S. government agency and not affiliated with or funded by any political party, organization or lobbying group. USDebtClock.org says it’s also not affiliated with the physical National Debt Clock located in New York City or any other online debt clocks.
PolitiFact contacted the email listed on the website’s about page, but received no response before publication.
The U.S. Debt Clock also has mobile apps in the Apple and Google Play app stores that were created by Chrono Numeric Labs LLC, a limited liability company registered in Michigan.
The debt clock website includes sources for all its metrics, except its DOGE Clock. When viewers hover over the DOGE Clock box, text appears that reads, ""The Department of Government Efficiency Advisory Commission, the real-time savings objective from reducing government waste, fraud and abuse in federal government agencies.""
Department of Government Efficiency’s own numbers don’t add up
The Department of Government Efficiency’s website said Feb. 17 that its estimated savings from the government is $55 billion — less than half the total listed on the U.S. Debt Clock website.
But this $55 billion total doesn’t add up, according to the ""wall of receipts"" posted on DOGE’s website.
Initially, DOGE’s Feb. 17 data release listed 1,128 government contracts it says have been canceled for a total savings of $16 billion. However, one Immigration and Customs Enforcement contract was incorrectly valued at $8 billion instead of $8 million. After this error was fixed, the website’s receipts showed about $8.5 billion in savings.

As of Feb. 21, the site also listed about 100 real estate contracts, which, if terminated, DOGE says would save about $144.6 million.
DOGE has not yet accounted for the remaining $46.4 billion in savings it claims to have secured. The website says the contracts listed so far account for 20% of the overall savings, but that’s incorrect. The $8.6 billion in supposed savings accounts for about 15.7% of $55 billion.
An NPR analysis found that about half of the government contracts listed on DOGE’s website, accounting for $6.5 billion in supposed savings, haven’t been terminated. The contracts NPR confirmed as canceled accounted for $2 billion.
Adding to the confusion: Other unrelated ‘clocks’ supposedly tracking DOGE
When we were looking into this post’s claim, we found multiple websites claiming to track the taxpayer money DOGE aims to save. The websites, ""dogegov.com"" and ""doge-tracker.com"" both feature a ""DOGE Live Tracker."" Neither website is affiliated with the federal government or DOGE.
The website dogegov.com was registered Sept. 1, 2024, and doge-tracker.com was registered Feb. 3.
On Feb. 21, both websites said that the ""official"" amount of tax dollars saved was $55 billion, pointing to DOGE’s website as the source. According to DOGE’s X account, the online trackers said $51.7 billion had been saved.
Our ruling
Social media posts cited what they called the ""US Debt Clock"" and said, ""DOGE has saved taxpayers $64 billion dollars in just 17 days.""
There is no evidence to support this claim. The posts pointed to USDebtClock.org, but the website provided no source or explanation for its ""DOGE Clock"" counter with a rapidly increasing multibillion-dollar savings total, which had hit $121 billion by Feb. 21.
The Department of Government Efficiency’s website said that as of Feb. 17, the advisory committee has saved $55 billion. However, the data available on its site accounts for only $8.5 billion.
We rate this claim False.

But that doesn’t always apply when it comes to categorizing people by their sex chromosomes.
""You either have XX or XY chromosomes,"" Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., wrote Feb. 20 on X. ""Those are the options.""
Most commonly, a person is born with two X chromosomes (female) or an X and a Y (male). But this is not always the case. 
Mace’s claim ignores the existence of several medical conditions, some first observed by scientists as far back as the 1930s. Genetic testing in the 1950s enabled scientists to link these conditions to various chromosomal abnormalities in which people’s sex chromosomes are neither XX nor XY.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
Mace’s office did not respond to a request for comment before publication. After publication, her office wrote in a Feb. 21 email, ""Barring chromosomal abnormalities, a person with a typical number of chromosomes — known as a euploid — has either XX or XY which determines biological sex.""
About 1.7% of the worldwide population has intersex conditions or differences in sex development — cases in which someone’s anatomy does not fit into male or female — according to a commonly cited review of medical literature published in 2000 by Brown University biologist Anne Fausto-Sterling. 
The conditions include: 
Klinefelter Syndrome (XXY): People with this condition, first identified in 1942, have an extra X chromosome. People with this syndrome are typically assigned male at birth; the condition can result in infertility, low testosterone and undescended testicles. It occurs in about 1 in 600 males. 
Turner Syndrome (missing or partial X): First identified in 1938, this syndrome occurs when a female is missing part of the X chromosome pair. This can cause short stature, delayed puberty, low sex hormones and possible infertility. 
Triple X Syndrome (XXX): The symptoms of this syndrome, also called trisomy X, can vary from mild — tall height — to more severe, including developmental delays. The condition, present in about 1 in 1,000 females, was first identified in 1959. 
Jacob’s Syndrome (XYY): A relatively rare condition with mild symptoms, males with this syndrome are born with an extra Y chromosome. It occurs in about 1 in 1000 males and was identified in the 1960s. 
According to a factsheet released by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, chromosomal variations ""occur in an estimated 1 in 1,500 to 1 in 2,000 live births, which amounts to approximately 200,000 to 330,000 Americans based on the current population.""

There are also intersex conditions that do not involve chromosomes because a person’s ""sex,"" according to scientists, is not easily measured by one factor. Chromosomes, gonads, hormones and genitalia can all contribute to a person’s sex categorization.
People born with de la Chapelle syndrome have XX chromosomes but can develop a penis, because a gene typically found on the Y chromosome gets moved to a new position on the X chromosome.
People with androgen insensitivity syndrome have male chromosomes, but don’t respond to their body’s naturally produced male hormones, ranging from mild to complete insensitivity. In cases of complete insensitivity, genetically male fetuses (XY), with internal testes and normal testosterone production could develop vaginas and be assigned female at birth. Partial and mild insensitivity can result in more ambiguous sex characteristics. 
Other conditions also result in ambiguous genitalia that do not fall neatly into a male or female sex category.
""A lot of other variations might be noticeable at birth if they cause other types of genital differences,"" Sylvan Fraser Anthony, legal and policy director at Interact, a nonprofit advocating for intersex youth, told PolitiFact. ""Others will be discovered, you know, not until later.""
Our ruling
Mace wrote on X, ""You either have XX or XY chromosomes. Those are the options.""

Although most people are born with either XX or XY chromosomes, science dating back decades shows some people are born with other chromosomal variations.
We rate this claim False.

Regardless, a drug testing policy for federal employees has existed since at least 1986 when President Ronald Regan instituted it by executive order. The federal government can drug test workers as a condition for hiring, through random selection or based on a reasonable suspicion of drug use that includes cocaine and methamphetamine. And although 24 states and the District of Columbia permit recreational cannabis, the U.S. government tests for marijuana because it’s still federally banned. 
Refusing to take a drug test or finding drugs in a federal employee’s sample could lead to a range of actions, including firing. In 2023, the Department of Health and Human Services estimated that federal agencies collect roughly 275,000 urine samples annually.

U.S. and Russian representatives held talks in Saudi Arabia that included discussion of how to end the war in Ukraine, and Trump dismissed complaints that Ukrainian officials were not invited to participate.
""I think I have the power to end this war, and I think it's going very well,"" Trump said while answering reporters’ questions Feb. 18 at his Mar-a-Lago resort. ""But today I heard (from Ukraine), ‘Oh well, we weren't invited.’ Well, you've been there for three years. You should have ended it three years — you should have never started it, you could have made a deal.""
This clashes with the evidence that Russia sent a large invasion force into Ukraine in February 2022.
The notion that Ukraine ""started it"" — that the country is to blame for an invasion that has killed an estimated 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers and at least 12,000 Ukrainian civilians — sparked outrage in Ukraine and from its allies. 
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded that Trump ""lives in this disinformation space.""
Trump’s former vice president, Mike Pence, posted Feb. 19 on X, ""Mr. President, Ukraine did not ‘start’ this war. Russia launched an unprovoked and brutal invasion claiming hundreds of thousands of lives. The Road to Peace must be built on the Truth.""
After Zelenskyy’s comments, Trump piled on more attacks on Truth Social, claiming the Ukrainian president ""is very low in Ukrainian Polls"" and is ""a Dictator without Elections.""
In a Kyiv International Institute of Sociology poll conducted Feb. 4 to 9, Zelenskyy had a 57% trust rating among Ukrainians surveyed. That’s down from 90% in May 2022, shortly after Russia’s invasion, but up from 52% in December 2024. Ukrainian law bans parliamentary and presidential elections during a state of martial law, which currently exists. Zelenskyy has promised elections once martial law is lifted. 
We asked the White House for evidence that Ukraine had started the war and received no response.
Russia’s attempt to blame Ukraine is part of a longstanding argument that doesn’t stand up to scrutiny.
What happened in February 2022
As people were sleeping, Russian troops and tanks rolled into Ukraine and missiles poured down in what U.S. military analysts called the largest military operation in Europe since World War II. The attack followed weeks of Russian maneuvers that included staging a large-scale military exercise along Russia’s border with Ukraine that the U.S. estimated to include 190,000 Russian troops. 
News coverage, video footage and the United Nations noted Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in real time. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced it as a ""special military operation"" at 6 a.m. Moscow time Feb. 24, 2022.
""The purpose of this operation is to protect people who, for eight years now, have been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kiev regime,"" Putin said in a televised address, using the Russian spelling of Ukraine’s capital city. ""To this end, we will seek to demilitarize and denazify Ukraine, as well as bring to trial those who perpetrated numerous bloody crimes against civilians, including against citizens of the Russian Federation.""
About 500 miles and a time zone away, residents of Kyiv awoke to the sounds of explosions. In the small eastern city of Sloviansk in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, loud booms drove people from their beds in panic. Families packed belongings, swarmed ATMs and gas stations, and tried to flee the Russian invasion in cars, trains, planes and on foot.
How did the false talking point that Ukraine started the war begin?
To set the stage for the invasion, Putin had long denied Ukraine was even a country, falsely characterizing its history and culture, arguing the Ukrainians were simply Russians who needed to be brought back into the fold. 
PolitiFact recognized Putin’s lies justifying the Ukraine war as our 2022 Lie of the Year.
In 1990, Ukraine's parliament declared its independence from the Soviet Union, a call it repeated in August 1991. Ukraine gained its independence four months later. In December 1991, Ukrainians voted overwhelmingly for independence, and within days, the USSR dissolved. In 1994, Ukraine agreed with the U.S., the United Kingdom and Russia to exchange its nuclear arsenal, the world's third-largest, for security guarantees.
But the rush of post-Soviet history grated on Putin, analysts say.
Putin has served as Russia’s top leader since 1999, with a four-year period in which he was nominally No. 2 but was widely considered the country’s ultimate center of power.
He has long sought to establish the theoretical foundations for escalating the war in Ukraine, a country with about one-third the population of Russia and, before the war, about one-ninth the gross domestic product.
As early as 2008, Putin told then-President George W. Bush that ""Ukraine is not a country."" Since then, Putin has asserted that there is no such thing as a Ukrainian people separate from Russia.

Putin set the table for the 2022 invasion with a 5,000-word essay in July 2021. In it, he argued that much of modern-day Ukraine occupies historically Russian lands and that ""Russia was robbed"" of them.
Putin’s essay blamed the conflict on the West, claiming that the protest-driven ouster of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych in 2014, an ally of Russia, was engineered from the outside, and that the Ukrainian government elected in 2014 is illegitimate. 
Putin’s argument was that Ukraine was poised ""to join NATO and have NATO missiles placed in Ukraine and aimed at Russia,"" said Alexander Motyl, a Rutgers University-Newark political scientist. In Putin’s telling, ""Poor Russia was forced to rush to the persecuted Ukrainians' defense and forestall NATO-inspired Ukranian aggression,"" Motyl said.
In 2023, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev echoed Putin’s stance, saying that Ukraine is a part of Russia, but ""we live in different apartments.""
Soon after the war started, more than 140 scholars signed a letter denouncing Putin’s narrative as ""factually wrong, morally repugnant and deeply offensive to the memory of millions of victims of Nazism and those who courageously fought against it, including Russian and Ukrainian soldiers of the Red Army.""
As for Trump’s recent remark, it is a ""distillation of these Russian talking points,"" Herron said.
Our ruling
Trump said  Zelenskyy ""started"" the war in Ukraine with Russia.
On Feb. 24, 2022, Russian forces launched an invasion on Ukraine, a country that the night before was at peace. Putin called it a ""special military operation"" and he premised the attack on false claims about Ukraine. As people were sleeping, Russian troops and tanks rolled into Ukraine and missiles poured down in what U.S. military analysts called the largest military operation in Europe since World War II.
The attack followed weeks of Russian maneuvers that included staging a large-scale military exercise along Russia’s border with Ukraine that the U.S. estimated to include 190,000 Russian troops.

Rumors about the Obamas’ marriage have circulated on social media since Michelle Obama did not join her husband at former President Jimmy Carter’s funeral or at President Donald Trump’s inauguration.

Michelle Obama did not publicly say why she didn’t attend either event. In her 2018 memoir, ""Becoming,"" she wrote that she would ""never forgive"" Trump for pushing the false claim that her husband wasn’t born in the U.S. Those allegations were ""crazy and mean-spirited"" and put her ""family at risk,"" she wrote.
Trump attended Carter’s funeral. He sat next to Obama and the two appeared to engage in pleasant conversation.
After Michelle Obama skipped both January events, social media users spread a baseless claim using artificially generated images that originally began as satire in 2014. That unfounded rumor said Barack Obama had an affair with former ""Friends"" star Jennifer Aniston, PolitiFact reported Feb. 5. Aniston shot down the rumor in an October appearance on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" saying it was ""absolutely untrue,"" as Kimmel held up a copy of the gossip magazine ""In Touch"" with the headline, ""The Truth About Jen & Barack!""
There is no evidence that the Obamas are divorcing. They have not publicly spoken about the rumors, but have shared recent social media posts declaring their love for each other.

"Susan Crawford
stated on February 9, 2025 in TV interview:",Wisconsin does not “require judges to automatically recuse just because they have done some kind of legal work in the past as a lawyer.”,"stated on February 9, 2025 in TV interview:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/feb/19/susan-crawford/candidate-right-that-wisconsin-does-not-require-ju/,N/A,"As the race for control of Wisconsin’s Supreme Court picks up steam, there’s a word you’ve probably heard: Recusal. 
Recusal refers to a justice’s decision to sit out a case because they have a connection to the lawsuit or lawyers that affects their ability to rule fairly. 
Dane County Court Judge Susan Crawford, the liberal candidate in the race, was asked by WISN-TV’s ""Upfront"" during its Feb. 9, 2025 episode if she should recuse herself from any case before the Supreme Court involving abortion. 
Crawford, as a private attorney, represented Planned Parenthood in challenging a state law that required physicians providing abortion services to get admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.
""The law does not require judges to automatically recuse just because they have done some kind of legal work in the past as a lawyer,"" Crawford said.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
Crawford’s involvement in the case happened about a decade ago: A federal appeals court panel found the law unconstitutional in 2015. 
Because recusal is bound to come up in the remaining weeks of campaigning, let’s take a look at what the standards are in Wisconsin. Legal experts will also explain why there are often gray areas.
Code of conduct requires recusal if justice served as a lawyer in the specific lawsuit
Let’s start with laying out what the Code of Judicial Conduct says about recusal, and if it mentions anything about stepping away because of previous work as a lawyer.
Here are just a few of the situations where the code says a justice should recuse. 
The judge was a material witness in the case.
The judge, their spouse or minor children have an economic interest in the case.
The judge’s spouse or relative is a lawyer in the case. 
But there’s another one that relates to Crawford’s claim: ""The judge served as a lawyer in the matter in controversy.""
Wait — does ""matter in controversy"" mean Crawford would be disqualified from participating in anything related to abortion?
That’s not the case, explained Charles Geyh, a professor at the Indiana University Maurer School of Law who specializes in judicial ethics. The ""matter"" refers to a specific lawsuit, not a broad issue. 
""You can certainly see where if you expanded it to include the issue, that would get crazy pretty quickly. Lawyers who are active litigators may be addressing bazillions of issue areas,"" Geyh said. 
Howard Schweber, a professor emeritus of political science and legal studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, noted many judges previously worked as criminal prosecutors or defenders.
""It would be absurd to suggest that those judges must recuse themselves from any case involving a crime,"" Schweber said. 
Recusal decisions exist on a spectrum, can lead to some grey areas
But sometimes it’s not quite so straightforward. Schweber sees recusal decisions as a spectrum. 
At the most obvious end is recusing because you’d make money if you rule a certain way. At the other end is recusing because of a philosophical belief you have. 
If a justice worked for Planned Parenthood on the particular issue in a lawsuit now before the Supreme Court, recusal would be appropriate, Schweber said. But simply working for Planned Parenthood is less so. 
""It’s unfortunately really quite difficult to be much more specific than that, because there’s an element of judgment involved,"" Schweber said. 
Crawford’s campaign provided much of the same background when PolitiFact Wisconsin reached out, citing a report on recusal from the State Democracy Research Initiative at UW’s Law School.
""Notably, Judge Crawford’s representation of Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin was not the same action that is now before the court. Recusal is not required simply for having represented a party in previous actions,"" her campaign said.
For context, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin has asked the Supreme Court to recognize a constitutional right to bodily autonomy, including abortion.
Schweber said working on a particular issue like the constitutionality of Act 10 would be a stronger case for recusal. ""It’s further down that spectrum of possibilities,"" Schweber said.  
Another way to look at the spectrum: Conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn recused from the current Act 10 case because he helped create the law and defended it as former Gov. Scott Walker’s chief legal counsel.
Crawford also addressed Act 10 in the interview — she represented teachers challenging the law. Crawford said she’d consider the parties bringing the lawsuit and which part of Act 10 is being litigated.

“Melania wins $900 million ‘defamation lawsuit’ against The View & Sunny Hostin.”
By Sofia Ahmed • February 4, 2025
Justices themselves ultimately decide whether to recuse, some have called for stricter rules
That gets into a second major idea that supports Crawford’s claim.
In Wisconsin, Supreme Court justices decide for themselves if they’d be biased on a certain issue and if they should recuse. The other justices can’t overrule their decision.
So, it would be up to Crawford to make the final call about whether to step away from a case involving a group she represented or an issue she worked on in the past.
""If you work for Planned Parenthood, you can assume that you’re not hostile to the goals of Planned Parenthood,"" Geyh said.
""But even then, there is no rule that says once you stop doing that and you put on your judicial hat, that you are somehow compromised in your ability to be fair and impartial,"" he said.
Because justices rule on their own bias, some have called for stricter standards. Geyh is on board with that idea but cautioned that partisan interests could ""manufacture"" new rules to get a justice off a case.
Crawford and her conservative opponent, Waukesha County Court Judge Brad Schimel, were asked by WISN if they would back imposing recusal rules for the Supreme Court.
Schimel said he would want to see what the rules would be before deciding whether to support them. 
Crawford said she thinks the current judicial code is a ""workable system, but I also welcome any opportunities to strengthen and improve a system like that.""
Our ruling
Crawford said Wisconsin does not ""require judges to automatically recuse just because they have done some kind of legal work in the past as a lawyer.""
Legal experts interviewed by PolitiFact Wisconsin agreed — it would be a slippery slope if justices weren’t allowed to participate in cases that broadly relate to their past work. 
The judicial code requires recusal if the justice worked as a lawyer in the ""matter in controversy."" That refers to a particular lawsuit, not a broad issue like abortion. But there can be gray areas.
Ultimately, it’s up to Crawford to determine whether she’d be impartial in a case, the same as any other justice on the bench.

How much are members of Congress paid?
Most congressional members receive an annual salary of $174,000, the Congressional Research Service said. For those in leadership positions, including House speaker, Senate president pro tempore and the House and Senate majority and minority leaders, the pay is higher.
When Pelosi was House speaker, she received a $223,500 salary. The X post claims this is still how much Pelosi makes, but that’s inaccurate. Pelosi left this leadership position in 2023, so her current salary is $174,000.
Similarly, McConnell, the longest serving Senate leader in history, left his position as Republican Senate leader in November 2024. In that leadership role, McConnell earned $193,400. His salary this year is $174,000. Even at his highest pay, McConnell earned less than what the post claimed.
Schumer, as the Democratic Senate minority leader, receives a $193,400 salary, about $17,000 less than what the post said.
Warren does not serve in any leadership positions, so her salary is $174,000 — $111,000 less than the post claimed.
These congressional salary levels have remained unchanged since 2009, the Congressional Research Service said.

Net worth is the value of a person’s assets, such as cash, real estate or stocks, minus any debts owed. In their annual financial disclosures, lawmakers are not required to report the exact value of their assets and liabilities. Instead, they must list a range of values for each item.
Additionally, not all of the assets and liabilities reported are held solely by the Congress member. Lawmakers must also report assets and liabilities held solely by or jointly with their spouses.
To estimate the Congress members’ net worths, PolitiFact added the minimum possible values for each asset and the maximum possible values for each asset. We did the same for the lawmakers’ liabilities.
We then subtracted the lawmakers’ maximum debt amount from their minimum asset amount, and their minimum debt amount from their maximum asset amount. The resulting range shows how much each lawmaker could be worth. We included in our calculations assets and liabilities held by lawmakers’ spouses.
Pelosi
The minimum possible value of Pelosi’s household assets in 2023 totaled more than $92 million. The maximum possible value of the assets totaled about $371 million. Pelosi’s household debts in 2023 ranged from $36 million to $102 million. Most of these assets and liabilities were held solely by Pelosi’s husband, Paul Pelosi, a businessperson who founded a real estate and venture capital investment firm.

Subtracting the Pelosi household’s maximum debt amount — $102 million — from their minimum asset amount — $92 million — results in a minimum possible net worth of about negative $10 million, meaning she would be millions of dollars in debt.
On the other hand, Pelosi and her husband could be worth as much as about $335 million when subtracting their minimum debt of $36 million from their maximum asset amount of $371 million.
So, it’s possible that Pelosi has a net worth of $202 million, as the X post claimed, but that’s a guess — and the post lacks context about the holdings mostly belonging to Pelosi’s husband and the range of wealth they could have.
McConnell
McConnell reported that the value of his assets in 2023 ranged from about $17.7 million to almost $70 million. Less than half this wealth came from assets owned solely by McConnell’s wife, Elaine Chao. McConnell reported no liabilities. (Lawmakers are required to report only debts of more than $10,000.) The X post overstated McConnell’s highest possible net worth by about $25 million.
Schumer
Schumer’s 2023 financial disclosure report shows his household net worth ranged from about $687,000 to about $2.3 million. Almost all of the assets reported were held by Schumer’s wife, Iris Weinshall, and the one reported liability was a jointly held mortgage. The post inflated Schumer’s household net worth by more than $70 million.
Warren
Warren reported that the value of her assets in 2023 ranged from about $4 million to more than $9 million. Two assets held by Warren’s husband, Bruce Mann, had a value of at least $1 million with no maximum value disclosed, so Warren’s household net worth could be higher. Warren reported no liabilities. The X post exaggerated her net worth by about $58 million.
Warren’s spokesperson said the $67 million number is inaccurate and referred PolitiFact to Warren’s public financial disclosure reports.
PolitiFact also contacted Pelosi’s, McConnell’s and Schumer’s offices, but received no response before publication.
Our ruling
An X post claimed that Pelosi has a $223,000 salary and a $202 million net worth; McConnell has a $200,000 salary and a $95 million net worth; Schumer has a $210,000 salary and a $75 million net worth; and Warren has a $285,000 salary and a $67 million net worth.
Almost all of these figures are wrong. All the salaries listed in the post are higher than what these lawmakers currently earn. It’s possible Pelosi’s net worth could be in the $202 million range, but that’s a guess, and the claim lacks context about how much of Pelosi’s reported wealth is held solely by her husband.

Sign up for PolitiFact texts
The federal civilian workforce increased by 4.8% during Biden’s term — not by almost 50%.
There were about 2.89 million federal employees when Biden took office, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics — not 2.1 million.
When Biden left office, there were about 3.02 million federal employees, Bureau of Labor Statistics figures show. The count included about 600,000 postal workers who were not paid by taxpayer dollars because the U.S. Postal Service is generally self-funded. It also included congressional staffers and other employees outside the executive branch. It excludes the military’s 1.3 million active-duty uniformed service members, who are generally not counted among federal employees.
President Donald Trump oversaw a modest increase in federal government hiring during his first term, with a 2.6% increase in the federal workforce. There were about 2.81 million federal workers when Trump entered office in January 2017, and 2.89 million when he left in January 2021. 
Since 2000, the number of federal government workers has increased by 9.2%, largely staying between 2.7 million and 2.8 million until the count surpassed 3 million during Biden’s term. The number of employees briefly spiked every 10 years during the decennial censuses. 
And the numbers have been higher: From 1985 to 1994, under both Republican and Democratic administrations, there were more than 3 million federal employees. The number dropped by 11% during President Bill Clinton’s tenure as he implemented measures to streamline the federal workforce. 
It’s unclear where the incorrect 2.1 million figure came from.
The Office of Personnel Management provides detailed information on executive branch employees, which excludes postal workers, congressional staffers and intelligence agency workers. The number of people working in the executive branch was at around 2.17 million in December 2020, shortly before Biden took office. The number grew by about 5.5%, to 2.29 million in May 2024, the most recent month available.

During a similar window of Trump’s first term, from December 2016 to June 2020, the number of executive branch workers increased by about 3.2%.
Biden increased hiring at most federal agencies
Biden increased hiring in all but two Cabinet-level agencies, as well as at most independent agencies.
The departments that saw biggest personnel increases during Biden’s term were the State, Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs, Treasury and Energy departments, Government Executive reported in January. 
The Defense and Commerce departments lost workers.
Although federal employment ticked up during Trump’s first term, he cut staff at most federal agencies. Employment increased at the Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs and the Defense Department, offsetting cuts elsewhere in the executive branch, Government Executive reported. The Education, State and Labor departments saw the biggest employment cuts, all shrinking more than 10%. 
Trump has made slashing the federal workforce a top priority of his first month back in office. Trump’s administration terminated thousands of employees on probationary status Feb. 13, a day after a federal judge greenlit a buyout offer that the White House said 77,000 employees had accepted before it closed. Labor unions sued the Trump administration over the probationary employee firings. 
Our ruling
A social media post said the federal workforce ""was at 2.1 million"" when Biden took office and ""had increased to 3 million"" by the time he left.
The federal workforce grew by about 4.8% during Biden’s term, increasing from 2.89 million in January 2021 to 3.02 million in January 2025. Measuring just executive branch employees, the count increased by about 5.5%, from 2.17 million to 2.29 million.

The move worries voting rights advocates who say it would hinder registration among eligible citizens.
The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, or SAVE Act, would set federal standards for voter registration. The bill lists documents people could use to prove their citizenship when registering to vote, such as a birth certificate or passport. The bill’s text makes no mention of a marriage certificate or name change document.
According to the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning voting rights advocacy group, more than 21 million voting-age American citizens — or 9% of eligible voters — don’t have ready access to documents to prove their citizenship.
Critics have also said the bill would make it difficult for a person who takes a spouse’s last name after marriage —overwhelmingly women in opposite-sex marriages — to register to vote. If someone lacks a passport with a current name, providing documents with the correct name would be more difficult. 
""If you are a woman that has changed your name from your birth certificate, let’s say through marriage and you took your husband’s name, you are no longer eligible to vote if this bill passes the Senate,"" said one TikTok user. 
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
That’s not quite accurate. The bill would make voter registration more difficult for married people who change their last names, and anyone whose name does not match the name on a birth certificate. But it would not prohibit it outright. 
The bill’s Republican supporters say the legislation is necessary to ensure that noncitizens don’t vote in U.S. elections. Federal and state laws already prohibit noncitizens from voting in federal elections, and cases of noncitizens voting are extremely rare. 
What the SAVE Act does 
The bill, a priority of House Republicans, would require people registering to vote or updating their voter registrations to use certain identifying documents, including military IDs, enhanced IDs showing citizenship, birth certificates or passports to prove  citizenship. 
The House passed the bill in 2024, but it stalled in the Senate. In January, U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, reintroduced the bill for the current Congress.
A passport alone would be sufficient to register under the bill, but a person who presents a birth certificate also would need a photo ID that matches the birth certificate’s information. About half of Americans don’t have passports, and the application process is expensive and time-consuming. 
For people who lack passports, any mismatch between their birth certificates and IDs would present problems with registration, Wendy Weiser, the vice president for democracy at the Brennan Center, said. Such a mismatch is common for people who change their names following marriage.
A Pew research survey found 79% of married women in opposite-sex marriages took their spouse’s last name. About 5% of men changed their last names after marriage. For same-sex marriages, Pew said the sample was too small to measure.
A 2006 Brennan Center survey found that 34% of women lack access to proof of citizenship with their current legal name. 
Proponents say one section of the bill addresses the needs of people with name changes. It directs each state to ""establish a process under which an applicant can provide such additional documentation"" to establish citizenship if the person’s documents don’t include matching information.
In a statement, Roy dismissed the criticism and argued the bill wouldn’t prevent people who have changed their names from registering to vote. 
""The legislation provides a myriad ways for people to prove citizenship and explicitly directs States to establish a process for individuals to register to vote if there are discrepancies in their proof of citizenship documents due to something like a name change,"" Roy said.

In a statement provided by Roy’s office, Cleta Mitchell, the founder of the Only Citizens Vote Coalition, said married women regularly have to provide birth certificates and marriage licenses in order to change their names for Social Security documents, bank accounts and other documents. She acknowledged the process ""is a pain,"" but said ""millions of women do it every day.""
Mitchell, a lawyer and former Oklahoma state representative, has pushed unfounded theories about voter fraud and worked on President Donald Trump’s campaign’s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.
But Weiser said the provision isn’t explicit enough to guarantee that something such as a marriage license would be sufficient to prove citizenship. The bill requires states to have a process to address discrepancies, but states could implement that in different ways. 
The flexibility is also undercut, she said, by another portion of the bill that would impose criminal charges on election workers who do not adequately vet someone’s citizenship on registration documents. A person who registers an application to vote without proof of citizenship could be subject to a fine and up to five years in prison. 
""Election officials are going to be very wary of subjecting themselves to criminal prosecutions just to register someone to vote if their proof of citizenship doesn’t clearly meet the statutory requirement,"" Weiser said.
Women who change their names after marriage already face hurdles to vote in some states that require voter ID, PolitiFact previously reported. 
Our ruling
A TikTok video said that women who changed their name after marriage are ""no longer eligible to vote"" if the SAVE Act becomes law.
The bill does not make women ineligible to vote if they have changed their names after marriage. But its documentation provisions could make voter registration harder for people who change their names and don’t have valid passports. The overwhelming majority of people who change their names after marriage are women.

Here are the facts.
FEMA has funded states and organizations that help migrants since Trump’s first term
Since Trump’s first administration, FEMA has given money to help state and local governments and nonprofit organizations that provide immigrants with basic services.
In 2019, as illegal immigration increased, Congress gave FEMA funding to expand its Emergency Food and Shelter Program to include migrant support services to immigrants  awaiting court proceedings. The program previously had been used only for people facing homelessness and hunger. 
In 2023, Congress directed U.S. Customs and Border Protection and FEMA to create the Shelter and Services Program for migrants, removing immigration grants from the Emergency Food and Shelter Program. The Shelter and Services Program uses money Congress has given Customs and Border Protection, and is administered by FEMA.
In fiscal year 2024, which started October 2023 and ended September 2024, Congress directed U.S. Customs and Border Protection to give FEMA $650 million for the Shelter and Services Program. 
Neither program was, or is, funded with money promised to FEMA’s disaster relief work. 
""The Disaster Relief Fund has nothing to do with any migrant assistance account because all that spending is from separate funds,"" Joshua Sewell, a federal budget expert at the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense, told PolitiFact in October 2024.
During Trump’s first administration, he shifted $271 million in FEMA funding, including about $155 million from the Disaster Relief Fund, to address immigration.
New York City received about $59 million from FEMA, spent $19 million on hotels
Musk did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for evidence that FEMA sent New York City $59 million ""last week."" 
FEMA’s Shelter and Services Program website shows how much money state and local governments and nonprofit organizations have received from the program. However, the data is only updated through fiscal year 2024. In 2024, New York City’s Office of Management and Budget received $59 million.

The New York City’s mayor office told The Associated Press Feb. 10 that it received $81 million from the federal government the week of Feb. 3 in two payments — one for $59 million, $19 million of which went to direct hotel costs. The mayor’s office did not respond to our request for comment.
""This morning, my financial team shockingly uncovered that President Trump and his crony Elon Musk illegally executed a revocation of $80 million in congressionally-appropriated FEMA funding from New York City’s bank accounts late yesterday afternoon,"" Brad Lander, New York City’s comptroller said in a statement posted to the agency’s website. ""This is money that the federal government previously disbursed for shelter and services and is now missing. This highway robbery of our funds directly out of our bank account is a betrayal of everyone who calls New York City home."" 
New York City law requires the government to provide shelter to people who need it. According to a July 2024 comptroller report, the city spent an average of $156 dollars per night per hotel room. 
According to FEMA’s list of allowable expenses for the shelter program, hotel room costs ""should be reasonable based on the rate set by the U.S. General Services Administration.""
The U.S. General Services Administration sets the per diem rates for New York City hotel rooms at between $179 and $342 per night, depending on the month. Luxury, five-star hotels in New York City cost around $400 to $1,000 a night, according to a search on Expedia, a travel booking site.
Our ruling
Musk said ""The @DOGE team just discovered that FEMA sent $59M LAST WEEK to luxury hotels in New York City to house illegal migrants … That money is meant for American disaster relief.""
FEMA awarded New York City $59 million in fiscal year 2024. The money is part of a program that Congress approved to reimburse local and state governments and nonprofit organizations that provide basic services to immigrants. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection funds the program and FEMA manages it. None of the money comes from FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund, which is primarily used after natural disasters. 
New York City does not house migrants in luxury hotel rooms. In 2024, it spent an average of $156 dollars per night per hotel room, below the General Services Administration’s per diem rate. The city spent $19 million on hotel rooms.

Power was a Harvard Kennedy School professor and has written multiple books, including ""The Education of an Idealist,"" ""A Problem from Hell"" and ""Chasing the Flame."" 
After Biden nominated Power to be USAID administrator in January 2021, she filed a financial disclosure report as required.
PolitiFact analyzed her financial disclosures from January 2021, May 2022, May 2023 and May 2024. These disclosures generally don’t include assets or government income. They permit officials to report their assets and liabilities in range values, not fixed amounts, so it’s difficult to know their exact net worth. 
We took the minimum and maximum amounts of Power’s assets, her spouse’s assets, and ""other assets and incomes"" she reported, and added them together. Then, we subtracted Power’s reported liabilities to get her net worth. 
In 2021, Power’s assets and income sources included compensation and benefits from her teaching position at Harvard University, capital gains from venture capital firm the Social+Capital Partnership LLC, multiple book royalties and honoraria from speaking engagements. In ""other assets and income,"" Power listed cash values in 12 U.S. banks, several Vanguard holdings, and other stocks.

That year, Power’s spouse, Cass Sunstein, a Harvard Law School professor and former administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, recorded double the assets of Power.
All the assets listed in Power’s financial disclosure totaled $11 million to $30 million. Power listed one item — a mortgage — under liabilities, valued from $500,001 to $1 million, which would have made her net worth between $10 million and $29.5 million. It was the only liability Powers reported for four years. 
Her total combined assets did not fluctuate wildly during her term. In 2022, her average net worth was $20.9 million; in 2023, $18.2 million; and in 2024, $20.8 million.
Her personal assets decreased while she was in the federal agency role. She received fewer honoraria in 2022, 2023 and 2024, her disclosures show.

But Shapiro has not been criminally charged in the Trump assassination attempt and is not being investigated, Richard Goldinger, Butler County’s district attorney, told PolitiFact in a Feb. 14 email.
The person who wrote the X post also shared a screenshot of a complaint, which said it was filed Feb. 7 by Hadassah Feinberg, a private citizen. 
The X post was amplified by high-profile X conservative accounts such as Alex Jones and podcaster Shawn Ryan.
Feinberg runs an X account with the handle @SpeakUpPa that was temporarily restricted as of Feb. 14. On Feb. 9, however, an X post archived by NewsGuard shows, she wrote that the recent complaint was one of two filed against Shapiro.
Feinberg also runs a TikTok account, speak_up_pa, that was not available as of Feb. 14. Before it was removed, we found a video there in which she said, ""I did file a private criminal complaint to the Butler County, Pennsylvania district attorney's office implicating Governor Josh Shapiro for the attempted assassination against former President Donald J Trump."" That video was also on YouTube, where the @speakup account was still active as of Feb. 14.
She did not provide evidence in the video to back her claim that Shapiro was involved in the shooting. Sticker text on the video said Shapiro is ""implicated for the attempted assassination against Trump and hundreds of crimes against innocent civilians.""
Pennsylvania code lets anyone file private criminal complaints against a person, including an affidavit of probable cause and the alleged crimes.
""These are not common but they are filed sometimes,"" University of Pittsburgh law professor David Harris said. ""They rarely go anywhere.""
Harris said such complaints are different from others in that they must be approved by the local district attorney. If denied, the person who filed it can ""petition the court of common pleas for review of the decision. ""

""Good luck with that,"" Harris said. ""For all intents and purposes, the DA's decision is final.""  
Goldinger said the complaint is forwarded to the district attorney’s office that would have jurisdiction. That was him in this case. Goldinger said the district attorney then approves or disapproves the complaint and may have a county detective investigate further if there is merit.
Goldinger said it’s a ""process that could easily be abused.""
""Simply preparing a private criminal complaint does not mean charges have been filed against someone,"" Goldinger said.
Goldinger confirmed he had received two complaints about Shapiro from Feinberg, one in July and one on Feb. 7. He rejected the first complaint and said he had just seen the most recent complaint, and had not yet reviewed it.
""I can tell you that there is not an investigation pending regarding Governor Shapiro and the allegations contained in the complaint,"" Goldinger said. ""Based on what I know, since this is the second private criminal complaint filed by this person against Governor Shapiro, I would not anticipate an investigation occurring. However, I will review the complaint carefully before deciding.""
Shapiro’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
On the day of the attack, Shapiro condemned the shooting in an X post and said he was praying for Trump. At a news conference the following day, he praised victim Corey Comperatore, a spectator who was killed in the attack.

In an interview with Fox News host Bret Baier that aired Feb. 10, Trump said the U.S. performs poorly on the global scale despite spending more than others on education.
""We're last in education out of 40 states,"" Trump said. ""We're last, we're number 40, but we're No. 1 in cost per pupil.""
Although Trump said ""states,"" it became clear as he spoke that he was referring to other nations — he described Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and China as being top in education globally. He did not, however, clarify all 40 countries he was referring to. A White House spokesperson pointed us to data on a U.S. educational assessment that provided no international comparison supporting Trump’s claim.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, a group of advanced, industrialized nations, measures international education outcomes.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
But the U.S. doesn’t rank last among the 38 OECD member states on any education metric, according to the organization’s data. The organization measures countries by student skills, educational attainment, years in education and economic equality.
""The US is rarely at the very bottom of an educational rankings that includes a broad range of countries (like the OECD),"" said Ofer Malamud, a Northwestern University economist researching international education. ""Although it isn’t usually near the top of these lists either.""
On cost per pupil, the U.S. spends much more than the international average, but it is not the highest spender of the OECD countries.
Trump’s criticism of the Education Department came as he and ally Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE — an agency Trump established by executive order — try to dismantle the agency and cancel large swaths of department spending. In the Fox News interview, Trump argued states would perform better in education if they received money directly rather than through Education Department programs. 
""While we spend billions of taxpayer dollars to fund our education system, less than half of 4th and 8th graders are performing at proficient levels in reading or math,"" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in an email, referring to National Center for Education Statistics’ state-by-state test scores known as the nation’s report card. 
Education performance
The OECD measures education outcomes based on the educational attainment, skills and years in education. OECD’s member countries include Sweden, France, Turkey, South Korea and Colombia. Its data included 37 to 41 countries, depending on when it was collected and which countries participated. 
The U.S. ranks eighth out of 41 countries in the portion of people with at least a secondary, or high school, education, with 92% of its people aged 25 to 65 holding a high school diploma. 
On the average number of years students spend in formal education, the U.S. ranks 23rd out of 41. From age 5, a child in the U.S. will spend an average of 17.3 years in formal education, according to the OECD. 
Mexico ranks last in educational attainment, while Colombia ranks last in years in education. The leaders in both metrics were Russia and Australia, respectively. 
The OECD administers the Program for International Student Assessment, or PISA, to member states and nonmember states. Looking at the 37 member states that reported scores in 2022, U.S. students scored above the international average in reading and science, but below average in math. 
The U.S. ranked 13th in science with a score that was 14 points above the OECD average. In reading, it ranked sixth, scoring 28 points above average. Math performance was lower: The U.S. ranked 28th, scoring seven points below OECD average. 
When compared with all 81 countries that took the test in 2022, including non-OECD countries, the U.S. ranked 16th in science, ninth in reading, and 34th in math.
PISA test scores also reveal, however, that when U.S. student performance is measured against itself, scores have dropped in the last several years. From 2018 to 2022, science scores fell by three points, reading by one point, and math by 13 points. Meanwhile, U.S. science and reading performance have risen modestly over the last 20 years while math has declined overall in line with global trends.
An OECD report pointed to COVID-19-related school closures and access to digital devices as contributing to weaker scores.

U.S. performance on the National Assessment of Educational Progress has also fallen since 2018. Less than half the surveyed fourth- and eighth-grade students performed at proficient levels in reading and math in the 2023 survey. 
Education costs
The amount the government spends on education per pupil in the U.S. is well above the international average, but not the highest of the 37 OECD countries measured in 2021. 
Combining public spending on elementary, high school and postsecondary education, the U.S. spent $20,387 per pupil on education in 2021 compared with an average of $14,209 across the measured countries. That puts the U.S. in third place, behind Luxembourg and Norway. The numbers are adjusted for purchasing power in the different countries.
The U.S.’ ranking is pulled higher by its high spending on college education, which includes dollars dedicated for research and development and is second after Luxembourg. Looking at primary school alone, the U.S. spends the sixth most of the 37 countries, with $15,270 per pupil. The OECD average was $11,902. 
Comparing education spending across countries is difficult, education experts said, because countries approach education funding differently.
""The US has long provided more services to students — such as meals, transportation, extracurriculars such as sports, and special education — than do other countries,"" Vanderbilt University public policy and education professor Sean Corcoran said. ""Many of these services do not translate directly into higher student achievement, but they are highly valued by families and society as a whole."" 
Because U.S. education is mostly funded by state and local governments, per-pupil spending can vary widely by school district, University of Washington education history professor Matthew Kelly said. 
Although there are some exceptions, high-income school districts tend to spend more money on education per pupil and have better outcomes, while low-income districts tend to spend less and have worse outcomes. 
Kelly said extensive research has demonstrated that higher education funding leads to better test scores, lower high school dropout rates and higher college enrollment rates.
Our ruling
Trump said the U.S. is ""last in education out of 40 states"" and ""No. 1 in cost per pupil.""
Both claims are wrong. The U.S. does not lead any international rankings for education, but it is not at the bottom of the list, either. Cost per pupil is higher than most developed countries, but not the highest.

On her eponymous podcast’s Feb. 3 episode, former Fox News host Megyn Kelly asked Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., whether he would root for the Kansas City Chiefs to defeat the Philadelphia Eagles during the Feb. 9 championship game. 
""So, does this mean, since you used to coach Patrick Mahomes, that you’re rooting for the Chiefs at the big game this Sunday?"" Kelly asked. Tuberville spent 40 years as a college football coach — including at Mahomes’ alma mater Texas Tech University — before becoming a U.S. senator. 
With a smile, Tuberville gently corrected Kelly. 
""Well, I never even coached him,"" he said. ""What happened is — I recruited him. And then I left and went to another school. But I’ve got to be very good friends with him. He’s a good — not just a good athlete. He’s a very good example for a lot of our young youth across this country.""

""He did not recruit me at the time,"" Mahomes said during a Feb. 6 press conference in response to a question about whether he had any relationship with Tuberville. ""I don’t — I don’t remember if I ever got to meet him or not.""
We contacted Tuberville’s office and received no reply.
Tuberville was Texas Tech’s head football coach from 2010 to 2012, three full seasons. He resigned as head coach Dec. 8, 2012. 
Mahomes played for Texas Tech from 2014 to 2016, before the NFL’s Kansas City Chiefs drafted him in 2017. 
News reports credit Tuberville’s successor, Kliff Kingsbury, with recruiting Mahomes. 
In 2022, ESPN reported that Kingsbury first noticed Mahomes in 2012, when Kingsbury was Texas A&M University’s offensive coordinator and Mahomes was a student-athlete at Whitehouse High School in East Texas. Then, when Kingsbury became Texas Tech’s head football coach, he prioritized recruiting Mahomes, ESPN reported.

Noem made a similar claim Feb. 9 on CNN’s ""State of the Union,"" two days after visiting the Guantánamo Bay facility.
The U.S. has previously used a Guantánamo Bay camp to detain certain migrants, but Trump’s use is different, immigration experts said.
On Jan. 29, Trump signed a memo directing the departments of Defense and Homeland Security to expand the Migrant Operations Center at Guantánamo Bay to ""provide additional detention space for high-priority criminal aliens unlawfully present in the United States.""

The administration has provided conflicting information about where migrants will be held within Guantánamo Bay, for how long and under what conditions. 
Based on available information, there are key differences between the naval center’s previous immigration operations and the Trump administration’s approach:
Historically, the U.S. has used Guantánamo Bay to hold migrants stopped at sea. Now, Trump is sending people who were detained on U.S. soil.
Previously, migrants were held at the Migrant Operations Center, a different part of the base from the prisons where terrorism suspects are detained. The first group of migrants that arrived at Guantánamo Bay under Trump are detained in the prisons where terrorism suspects were held.
In recent years, the Migrant Operations Center has held few migrants and had limited capacity. Trump says he plans to detain 30,000 people. That many people haven’t been detained at Guantánamo Bay since the 1990s.

In the 1990s, the U.S. held thousands of Haitians and Cubans at Guantánamo Bay
The Guantánamo Bay naval base is better known as a high-security prison for foreign terrorism suspects following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. But about a decade before, the U.S. used a section of it as a migrant detention center.
In the early 1990s, the U.S. Coast Guard held Haitians and Cubans intercepted at sea at Guantánamo Bay. In September 1994, 12,000 Haitians and 33,000 Cubans were held in Guantánamo Bay’s Migrant Operations Center, the Congressional Research Service found. People were held in tentlike structures surrounded by razor wire.
People held in Guantánamo Bay did not have access to lawyers to help them apply for asylum, Yale Law professor Harold Koh told PBS News in 2017. Koh sued the U.S. government over its treatment of Haitians in Guantánamo Bay. 
Some Haitians and Cubans were allowed to apply for asylum; few got it. Many Haitians whom the government determined could apply for asylum were barred from entering the U.S. to apply because they were HIV-positive, the National Immigrant Justice Center, an immigrant advocacy organization, wrote in a 2021 report. 
The migrant camp closed in 1996. But that wasn’t the last time migrants were held in Guantánamo Bay.

The Guantánamo Migrant Operations Center, which is separate from the detention center where terrorism suspects are kept, can hold about 130 people, according to the Global Detention Project, an international group that documents immigration detention worldwide.
The Department of Homeland Security did not answer PolitiFact’s query about how many migrants were at Guantánamo Bay before Trump’s order. But in September 2024, The New York Times reported the center had held 37 people from 2020 to 2023, and four people as of February 2024. People detained there were intercepted at sea by the U.S. Coast Guard.
People intercepted at sea and sent to Guantánamo don’t have the option to seek asylum in the U.S., the International Refugee Assistance Project said in a September 2024 report. Instead they must choose between returning to the country they’re fleeing or waiting in Guantánamo Bay for a third country to accept them.
Migrants at Guantánamo Bay lack ""access to basic human necessities, appropriate medical care, education, and potable water,"" the refugee project said in its report. Migrants don’t have access to unmonitored calls with attorneys and can’t candidly speak about poor conditions at the naval base, the report said. 
How long people have been held in Guantánamo Bay varies. The New York Times reported in 2024 that families have been there for more than six months. But in one case, someone was held for nearly four years.
How the Trump administration’s approach for migrant detention at Guantánamo Bay is different
Trump’s unprecedented proposal raises legal questions. 
The U.S. has never sent people who were arrested or detained in the United States to Guantánamo, the Council on Foreign Relations, a nonpartisan foreign policy think tank, wrote Feb. 4.
Under federal law, people in the U.S. accused of civil immigration violations have more rights than the people intercepted at sea, Hannah Flamm, interim senior policy director at the International Refugee Assistance Project, said.
People who have been on U.S. soil ""have rights and protections, even if they are sent to Guantánamo. Whether these rights will be respected is another question,"" she said.
It’s not clear how due process for migrants will be followed, as Noem assured.
""The U.S. government intentionally uses Guantánamo in hopes of avoiding oversight and the public eye, which makes the facility ripe for abuse,"" Flamm said.
The American Civil Liberties Union wrote the Trump administration a letter Feb. 7 requesting access to the migrants who have been sent to Guantánamo Bay so they have ""access to legal counsel, and so advocates and the public can understand the conditions under which the government is detaining them.""

Video shows “roads heading to Mexico are jam packed as mass deportations have started.”
By Loreben Tuquero • January 24, 2025
In her Feb. 9 CNN interview, Noem said she and Trump were ""comfortable"" that it is legal to bring migrants who were already on U.S. soil to the island.
It’s unclear how long the migrants will be at Guantánamo Bay under Trump’s plan.
Noem and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have said immigrants’ detention at Guantánamo Bay will be temporary while they await deportation. On CNN, Noem said, ""My goal is that people are not in these facilities for weeks and months,"" though she wouldn’t rule out longer stays if other countries don’t accept them.
On Jan. 29, Trump said he intends Guantánamo Bay to hold ""the worst criminal illegal aliens threatening the American people. Some of them are so bad we don’t even trust their countries to hold them because we don’t want them coming back.""
It’s unclear what will happen if the government tries to indefinitely detain migrants sent to Guantánamo Bay. 
People cannot be indefinitely held in immigration detention in the U.S., the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2001. So immigrants who cannot be deported because their home countries won’t accept deportation flights are generally released. 
Another shift from the previous use of Guantánamo Bay for immigration detention is the location where migrants will be held under Trump’s administration.
Hegseth said migrants sent to Guantánamo Bay would be detained separately from the camp where terrorism suspects are kept. He said they would be detained in the Migrant Operations Center.
The 10 migrants on the first flight from the U.S. to Guantánamo Bay were placed in one of the detention centers where terrorism suspects previously held, not in the Migrant Operations Center. The building the migrants are in is not the same building where the remaining 15 wartime detainees are held, the Defense Department said.
Wartime detainees have been held in Guantánamo Bay for decades.

Our ruling
Noem said that at Guantánamo Bay, ""we'll have the capacity to continue to do there what we've always done. We've always had a presence of illegal immigrants there that have been detained."" 
The Trump administration has provided limited and conflicting information about its plans to detain migrants in Guantánamo Bay. Noem’s characterization that the administration is continuing what the U.S. has previously done leaves out key details.
In the 1990s, the U.S. used Guantánamo Bay to hold Haitian and Cuban immigrants intercepted at sea. The Trump administration is now sending to Guantánamo people who were arrested on U.S. soil. That hasn’t happened before.
In the 1990s, more than 30,000 people were held in tentlike structures. In recent years, fewer than a hundred people have been held at the migrant center at a time. 
Trump is planning to significantly increase Guantánamo Bay’s immigration detention capacity to 30,000.  
The first group of migrants to arrive in Guantánamo Bay under Trump’s proposal are being held in the detention center that has historically held terrorism suspects. That’s not the same place where migrants have historically been held.

Trump is referring to Harris’ answers in two videos CBS News released. In an Oct. 6, 2024, video clip previewing the interview on the CBS News show ""Face the Nation,"" Harris answered a question about U.S.-Israel relations. The next day, when the ""60 Minutes"" interview aired, it showed Harris giving a different answer to the same question.
The full, unedited interview transcript shows that CBS News’ ""60 Minutes"" took Harris’ answers in both videos from the same three-and-a-half-minute exchange on U.S.-Israel relations. It does not show that CBS News replaced Harris’ answers on this topic with a response from a different portion of the interview.
It’s typical for news outlets to edit long interviews into shorter broadcast segments or published stories.
Trump backed out of his CBS News ""60 Minutes"" interview before the 2024 election, breaking a decadeslong tradition of major party presidential candidates’ interviews with the network ahead of the general election.
PolitiFact contacted the White House for comment, but received no response.
What the full, unedited transcript shows
Because the interview aired on the anniversary of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, ""60 Minutes"" correspondent Bill Whitaker began the interview with questions about Israel and the Biden-Harris administration’s relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
PolitiFact annotated the unedited interview transcript below to show how ""60 Minutes"" presented Harris’ answers in the preview clip and aired interview.
Here’s a guide, followed by the exchange:
Bold: Only in the preview clip.
Italics: Only in the aired interview.
Bold and italics: In both videos.
Unmarked sections: Not included in either video.
Whitaker: ""We supply Israel with billions of dollars in military aid.""
Harris: ""Mm-hmm.""
Whitaker: ""And yet Prime Minister Netanyahu seems to be charting his own course. The Biden administration, the Biden-Harris administration has pressed him to agree to a cease-fire, he's resisted. You urged him not to go into Lebanon, he went in anyway. He has promised to make Iran pay for the missile attack, and that has the potential of expanding the war. Does the U.S. have no sway over Prime Minister Netanyahu?""
Harris: ""Well, let’s start with this. On this subject, the aid that we have given Israel allowed Israel to defend itself against 200 ballistic missiles that were just meant to attack the Israelis, and the people of Israel. And I think that is the most recent example of why what we do to assist in their defense around military aid is important. And when we think about the threat that Hamas, Hezbollah presents Iran, I think that it is without any question our imperative to do what we can to allow Israel to defend itself against those kinds of attacks. Now, the work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles, which include the need for humanitarian aid, the need for this war to end, the need for a deal to be done which would release the hostages, and create a cease-fire. And we’re not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel, and in the region, including with other leaders in the region, including Arab leaders.""
Whitaker: ""But it seems that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening. The Wall Street Journal said that he — that your administration has repeatedly been blindsided by Netanyahu, and in fact, he has rebuffed just about all of your administration’s entreaties.""
Harris: ""Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region. And we’re not going to stop doing that. We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.""
Whitaker: ""Just one last thing. Do we have a real close ally in Prime Minister Netanyahu?""
Harris: ""I think, with all due respect, the better question is do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people. And the answer to that question is, ‘Yes.’ And we are going to do what is important to support whatever leadership is in Israel, that is defending the security of the State of Israel.""

After this response, Whitaker changed topics to ask Harris why she wanted to be president. The Israel topic arose only once more during the interview, when Harris briefly mentioned Iran’s ballistic missile attack on Israel.
The full, unedited interview video is available on ""60 Minutes"" YouTube page. The exchange about U.S.-Israel relations starts about six minutes in.
You can also read the full, unedited interview transcript here. The exchange about U.S.-Israel relations is on Pages 11-13. Parts highlighted in yellow were included in the preview clip, parts highlighted in blue were in the aired interview and parts highlighted in green were in both videos.
Why did ""60 Minutes"" share different clips?
When publishing the transcripts and video the Federal Communications Commission requested, CBS News said in a statement that the content shows ""the ‘60 Minutes’ broadcast was not doctored or deceitful.""
In its statement, CBS News noted that it’s common practice for journalists to edit interviews for time, space or clarity. The full, unedited interview video is 57 minutes long; that was edited down to 20 minutes.
CBS News said it broadcast a longer portion of Harris’ answer to Whitaker’s question about U.S.-Israel relations in a preview clip and a shorter version of Harris’ answer was included in the aired interview.
The news outlet said it edited the ""60 Minutes"" interview to include as much of Harris’ answers to Whitaker’s questions as possible, while fairly representing the substance of Harris’ answers.
CBS News made a similar statement Oct. 20, 2024, rebutting Trump’s accusation of deceitful editing.
Kelly McBride, senior vice president and chair of Craig Newmark Center for Ethics and Leadership at the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, told PolitiFact that CBS News’ ""60 Minutes"" edited the Harris interview reasonably. (The Poynter Institute owns PolitiFact.)
""I would say that their edits are completely within the standards that journalists employ when they try to create an informative product for the public,"" McBride said. ""It seems very much like what journalists do with all verbose speakers, including and especially Donald Trump.""
Our ruling
Trump posted on Truth Social that CBS News and 60 Minutes ""replaced"" Harris’ ""60 Minutes"" interview answers ""with completely different, and far better, answers, taken from another part of the interview.""
The full, unedited interview transcript does not show that CBS News’ ""60 Minutes"" replaced all of Harris’ answers to questions about U.S.-Israel relations with a response from a different part of the interview. CBS did not change Harris’ meaning.
News outlets commonly edit interviews for length and clarity. CBS News used a longer version of Harris’ response in a video clip previewing the ""60 Minutes"" interview on the CBS News show ""Face the Nation."" It used a shorter excerpt of Harris’ answer in the aired ""60 Minutes"" interview. Both parts of Harris’ answer were taken from the same segment of the interview, the unedited transcript shows.
A media ethics expert said the ""60 Minutes"" interview adhered to typical journalistic standards.
We rate this claim False.

""So what happened to the four survivors?"" asked a man in a Facebook reel posted the day after a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter collided with an American Airlines plane approaching Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport over the Potomac River.
""It was reported last night that there were four survivors pulled out of the water,"" the man said. As he said this, he showed a screenshot of a Fox News chyron that read: ""RPT: Four people pulled from Potomac river."" Then, he said: ""Yet, today, it’s being reported that there’s no survivors at all."" 
The Facebook reel cut to a clip from WRC-TV, a Washington, D.C., NBC affiliate. ""As we were saying, so far what we know is that there are four victims who were taken to North Boathouse Fire Station at Reagan National Airport, which is south of the airport,"" a reporter said. ""And that’s going to be — kind of the gathering point as first responders try to find more people in the waters and any potential survivors.""
The Facebook reel’s caption said the early reports of survivors proved ""this DC plane crash story isn’t adding up"" and included the hashtag ""the world is a stage"" — a phrase often used to claim that events were preordained or faked.

During breaking news events, details often emerge slowly and change as more information becomes available. That happened here, and it doesn’t mean the crash was preplanned or suspicious.
The crash happened at about 8:48 p.m. ET.
WRC-TV initially reported that four people had been ""recovered,"" but the station’s subsequent reports confirmed there were no crash survivors. 
""We’ve got some good news here,"" a reporter said at 10:13 p.m., the earliest WRC-TV mention of survivors we found using the TV monitoring service TVEyes. ""Our Julie Carey is reporting that at least four victims have been recovered, and they have been taken to the North Boat Firehouse Station at Reagan National Airport. Also, some — our Paul Wagner is being told — that they are being taken to the (Metropolitan Police Department) helipad off South Capitol Street. So, this is some good news that we know that those first responders are finding survivors there in those waters.""
At 10:21 p.m. another WRC-TV reporter said that four people had been ""rescued."" 
The NBC clip from the Facebook reel aired at 10:32 p.m. ET on WRC-TV. Just before the comments shown in the Facebook reel, Eun Yang, a WRC-TV anchor, said that first responders on the scene were doing everything possible in cold, dark waters, ""trying to find any survivors at this rate."" 
Then, she mentioned the four victims taken to North Boathouse Fire Station. At that point, WRC-TV didn’t report that those people were alive.
Other news organizations referred to the WRC-TV reporting, which fed the impression that there were survivors even if they did not use those words. 
TVEyes searches for combinations of phrases including ""four people,"" ""rescued,"" ""plane,"" and ""survivors"" on Jan. 29 revealed that some news outlets reported that four people had been rescued. In most cases, those outlets cited the local NBC affiliate’s reporting. 
NBC’s Washington, D.C. affiliate appeared to be the source of the Fox News chyron shown in the Facebook reel:
""We are now hearing, John, that from the NBC affiliate — and again, we have not independently verified this — that four people were pulled from the water after the collision near Washington Reagan Airport,"" Fox News host Trace Gallagher said at 10:29 p.m. ET. ""And again we don’t know if those people were on the aircraft. We don’t know if they were on board the helicopter. Right now, it’s just unknown.""

You wouldn’t know that from his early days as USAID’s acting director under President Donald Trump.
The agency that then-Sen. Rubio hailed for its ""critical"" and ""important"" programs? Rubio now says it suffers from disorganization and ""rank insubordination"" that hinders Trump’s foreign policy.
Trump and Department of Government Efficiency leader Elon Musk are pushing for major upheaval at USAID, including the reported shedding of all but 300 of its roughly 10,000 employees, or roughly 97% of its workforce. Rubio has helped carry out Trump’s agenda, although those reductions are being challenged in court. 
""U.S. AID systems and processes are not well synthesized, integrated, or coordinated, and often result in discord in the foreign policy and foreign relations of the United States,"" Rubio wrote in a Feb. 3 letter to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. ""This undermines the president’s ability to carry out foreign relations."" 
In a Feb. 5 Fox News interview, Rubio said USAID may be consolidated directly into the State Department. ""The goal was to reform it, but now we have rank insubordination,"" he said.

On occasion, PolitiFact uses its Flip-O-Meter to measure a politician’s consistency on particular issues. The rating does not make a value judgment about a politician who changes positions, but rather documents changes over time.
Rubio’s recent remarks about the agency show a marked departure from his prior stance as a defender of at least some USAID programs as vital for improving American national security and world health.
The State Department did not respond to an inquiry from PolitiFact.
Rubio regularly touted USAID’s work as a senator
During his 14 years as a Republican senator from Florida, Rubio repeatedly praised USAID for its work across a broad range of issues, from ensuring free and fair elections in Burma to supporting humanitarian efforts in Venezuela to providing hurricane relief in the Bahamas. 
At the same time, he also called for increased transparency within the agency, saying USAID’s funds must be spent effectively. 
""In every region of the world, we should always search for ways to use U.S. aid and humanitarian assistance to strengthen our influence, the effectiveness of our leadership, and the service of our interests and ideals,"" Rubio said during a 2012 speech at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C., think tank. ""Foreign aid is a very cost-effective way, not only to export our values and our example, but to advance our security and our economic interests.""
In 2013 and 2015, Rubio sponsored bills to create clear goals, define performance metrics and establish plans for monitoring and evaluating U.S. foreign assistance programs. A version of this bill, not sponsored by Rubio, passed the Senate in 2016 and became law.
From 2016 to 2023, under presidents of both parties, Rubio praised the agency on social media for providing hurricane relief in multiple Latin American countries; combating polio, Ebola, and tuberculosis (aid he called ""critical""); providing humanitarian assistance to Venezuelan refugees after the reelection of President Nicolás Maduro (aid he called ""important""); and providing Ukraine with humanitarian aid at the Russia-Ukraine war’s outset.
Rubio co-sponsored a 2018 bill with Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., that allocated USAID funding for violence prevention in certain countries and granted money to support USAID’s Global Initiative to Reduce Fragility and Violence.
He co-sponsored other bills that propose work for USAID, including a 2021 bill to advance global women’s rights, a 2022 bill to protect victims of international human trafficking, a 2017 bill authorizing $50 million for USAID involvement to combat substance abuse in the Philippines, and a 2021 bill for expanding access to education. He also wrote a 2021 letter to President Joe Biden urging USAID humanitarian relief in Colombia.
In a 2018 letter to then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Rubio, Kaine, and then-Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., wrote, ""We believe it is critical that USAID continue to play an active role in providing technical assistance, education and training to support countries’ efforts to strengthen electoral systems. USAID’s democracy and governance programs are vital for capacity building.""
Assessing USAID’s financial cost, political influence
In the past, Rubio has framed USAID as a relatively inexpensive investment in the nation’s security.
Many Americans overestimate how much the government spends on foreign aid, and Rubio repeatedly emphasized how small a portion of the federal budget foreign aid comprises. All foreign aid accounts for $68 billion, or about 1% of the total spent by the government in recent years; USAID itself is responsible for $43.4 billion of that $68 billion, or about 0.7% of all spending.
""Foreign aid as a part of our overall budget is less than 1% of the total amount the U.S. government spends,"" Rubio said in a 2017 Senate speech. ""I think it is important for those of us who believe in global engagement and believe in the function of foreign aid to justify it, to never take it for granted, and to constantly examine it to make sure the money is being spent well and that it is worth spending at all.""

In 2019, Rubio argued against cutting foreign aid as a way to meaningfully lower the federal debt.
""Anybody who tells you that we can slash foreign aid and that will bring us to balance is lying to you,"" he said in the speech to the Forum Club of the Palm Beaches. 
Rubio saw aid as a foreign policy tool to deter Chinese influence. 
In a 2022 letter to Biden, Rubio said USAID must receive funding ""to send a clear message that the United States has a comprehensive strategy to counter the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) expanding global influence and the increasing threat it poses to U.S. security interests and those of our allies and partners.""
In the Feb. 3 Fox News interview, Rubio said USAID funding had little to do with combating the Chinese Communist Party’s influence — and that aid from the Chinese government would not fill the foreign aid vacuum. 
In his new role, Rubio acknowledged some of his past commentary. According to a partial transcript obtained by The New York Times, Rubio said at a private embassy event that ""foreign aid is the least popular thing government spends money on. And I spent a lot of time in my career defending it and explaining it. But it’s harder and harder to do across the board. It really is.""
Rubio said foreign policy leaders understand foreign aid ""is essential,"" but ""it has to be programs that we can defend. It has to be programs that we can explain. It has to be programs that we can justify. Otherwise, we do endanger foreign aid.""
This may sound as if Rubio favors a cautious, deliberate effort to discern which programs should be continued and which ones should be ended. But that clashes with his recent actions, which have precipitated a cut of 97% of the agency’s staff.
Our ruling
On at least two dozen occasions over more than a decade — including in speeches, social media posts, and bill introductions — Rubio praised USAID’s work, from hurricane relief to battling infectious diseases to aiding refugees. He spoke broadly of the agency’s importance for American interests and countering China.
That yearslong record of praise contrasts sharply with his 2025 letter to Congress that said the agency’s failure ""undermines the president’s ability to carry out foreign relations,"" and the sudden, nearly across-the-board cuts he is executing.
Rubio’s change of message — from repeatedly praising USAID’s value to the U.S. and the world from 2012 to 2023, to saying it’s a danger to U.S. foreign policy in 2025 and abolishing most of its employees and work — rates as a Full Flop.

stated on January 28, 2025 in a senate special session:",Florida’s in-state college tuition waiver for immigrants in the country illegally costs the state $41 million.,"stated on January 28, 2025 in a senate special session:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/feb/06/randy-fine/florida-sen-randy-fines-shaky-claim-that-immigrant/,N/A,"As Florida Republicans continue to fight about whose plan is best to help President Donald Trump on immigration, one group hangs in the balance: immigrants in the country illegally who attend Florida public colleges. 
If signed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis — who has threatened to veto it — the Legislature’s immigration bill would revoke a 2014 law that lets immigrants in the country illegally who meet certain conditions pay in-state college tuition rates, which are typically much lower than out-of-state rates. The Legislature could override a DeSantis veto.
One supporter of eliminating the law, state Sen. Randy Fine, R-Brevard, said during a Jan. 28 special session the waiver encourages illegal immigration.

While listing reasons for eliminating the law, Fine, who cosponsored the immigration bill, said: ""Number one: it costs money. … We estimate $41 million dollars.""

During the special session, state Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando, pressed Fine on that point, saying, ""You’ve mentioned several times that we’re going to be saving $41 million. … So, you’re saying once we repeal in-state tuition we are going to get that $41 million back into the general revenue so we can reappropriate that, right? We are going to be saving as a state.""
Fine said, ""The universities would get to keep the $41 million. All tuition in the state goes directly to the universities.""
PolitiFact contacted Fine’s office to ask about the $41 million figure’s source. His office sent us the Senate analysis of the immigration bill, which estimated that for the 2023-24 fiscal year the value of the waived out-of-state fees totaled about $40.6 million.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
But that is not the same as the state paying that amount for the program.

The Senate analysis also says the fiscal impact of repealing the provision cannot be determined because it would be hard to identify exactly how many students would be affected. The waivers don’t identify the students by immigration status, but the in-state tuition waiver for immigrants in the country illegally has steep requirements to qualify, so experts believe only that group would apply for it.
""The revenue impact will also depend on the behavior of affected students,"" and whether they choose to reenroll without waivers, the analysis concludes. ""While the cumulative amount of the fee waivers was more than $40 million in (fiscal year) 2023-2024, it is not clear that institutions will receive that revenue with the changes to the fee waiver.""
Florida’s in-state college tuition waiver
In 2014, then-Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, signed House Bill 851, allowing immigrants in the country illegally to pay in-state college tuition rates if they meet certain requirements. ""Students that grew up in our state are going to get the same in-state tuition as their peers, which is what's fair,"" Scott said.
Florida, which is among 25 states with similar ""tuition-equity"" laws, offers a number of student waivers. The one given to immigrants in the country illegally is the 5012 nonresident waiver.

To qualify, students must prove that they graduated from a Florida high school, spent at least three consecutive years in Florida schools immediately before graduating and applied to a higher education institution within 24 months of high school graduation. (Immigrants in the country illegally remain ineligible for Florida scholarships such as Bright Futures and federal financial aid.)

The waiver’s requirements are stricter than those for legal residents and U.S. citizens, who must show they’ve lived in the state for at least 12 months before the academic term.

In-state tuition costs around $3,000 for Florida’s community colleges and $6,000 for public universities. Out-of-state tuition rates can cost more than three times as much. 
Will eliminating the waiver save the state money?
The Florida Policy Institute, a center-left research organization, said in a Jan. 15 report that ""contrary to how some state lawmakers have recently framed the fiscal impact of these waivers,"" allowing immigrants in the country illegally to access in-state tuition ""has not cost the state money."" Instead, the institute estimated that the waiver has ""generated millions in revenue for institutions experiencing drops in enrollment and financial strain.""

Take the Florida College System, previously known as community colleges. About 4,500 students used the in-state tuition waiver at those schools during the 2023-24 academic year, bringing in about $14.7 million in tuition, according to Florida Policy Institute’s calculation.
Enrollment at the 28-member college system remains 11% below prepandemic levels and education experts say it’s unlikely that enough new students would enroll to replace immigrants in the country illegally.

""There are no students ‘waiting in the wings’ to replace tuition paid by these students and the potential for colleges to lose out on this revenue is high,"" the Florida Policy Institute said in its report.

Second lady Usha Vance “will have her citizenship revoked if (President Donald) Trump signs his executive order banning birthright citizenship.”
By Sara Swann • January 21, 2025
The Florida Policy Institute and Senate analysis arrived at their waiver value estimates in different ways. The Senate’s analysis appears to reflect the difference between out-of-state and in-state tuition for students who received the waivers.

The Florida Policy Institute estimated how much students receiving waivers paid in tuition by multiplying the number of students who received the waiver in the 2023-24 academic year by the average cost of in-state tuition. The organization estimated that about 6,500 immigrants in the country illegally used the waiver to attend Florida’s colleges and state universities, paying about $26.7 million in in-state tuition and fees.

""It is misleading to say the waivers ‘cost’ $40.6 million because in reality, if students are not offered this waiver, many will not attend school in Florida at all,"" said Alexis Tsoukalas, a senior policy analyst at Florida Policy Institute and author of the brief. 
Florida colleges and universities are supported by Florida residents’ taxes, so ""state residents can attend public institutions at a lower cost than those not residents of the state,"" according to the Florida Department of Education. In Florida, immigrants in the country illegally paid about $1.8 billion in state and local taxes in 2022.
Our ruling
Fine said Florida’s in-state college tuition waiver for immigrants in the country illegally costs the state $41 million.

One analysis shows that the value of the waivers was more than $40 million in fiscal year 2023-24. That doesn’t mean the state paid that amount for the program. The program does not technically cost the state money.
Fine’s statement has an element of truth in that if the waiver is eliminated, public colleges and universities could receive more money in tuition payments from immigrants in the country illegally if they still chose to enroll, or other students wanting to enroll in the institutions. 
But education policy experts estimate that revoking the provision would likely cause colleges and universities to lose revenue. There likely aren’t enough students to enroll to make up for the loss of immigrants in the country illegally, who might not be able to afford tuition without the waiver. Many of Florida’s colleges already have enrollment numbers below pre-pandemic levels.

The posts are wrong on two counts:
The flag icon atop many government websites is not new or unique to the second Trump administration. It was first used in 2017 during Trump’s first term and was used throughout former President Joe Biden’s administration. 
Civil War historians told PolitiFact that the flag used bears no resemblance to a confederate flag.
(Screenshots from X and Instagram.)
About the flag icon
A U.S. General Services Association spokesperson told PolitiFact in an email that the banner atop government websites is part of the U.S. Web Design System’s tool kit. The system helps government teams design and maintain their websites.
The tool kit recommends using the banner with the flag icon to identify official .gov or .mil domains to show the sites have secure HTTPS connections and to identify them as official government sites, the spokesperson said.
The banner hasn’t changed since its first publication in 2017. The number of stars was a design decision based on the flag icon’s limited size, and represents no past or current flags, the spokesperson said.
A State Department spokesperson said the General Services Administration maintains the federal website standards site, which said all government sites should use the federal government banner.
The State Department added the banner Nov. 30, 2020, based on that guidance, and it has remained on the site since, the spokesperson said.
A search of the Internet Archive shows several government websites using the nine-star flag icon before the start of Trump’s second term.
(Screenshot from a State Department website archived March 17, 2021, by the Internet Archive.)
Confederacy claims
Civil war historians told PolitiFact that the flag used on the website is not a Confederate flag.
The Confederacy’s first national flag, known as the ""Stars and Bars,"" was used from 1861 to 1863. Some versions of the flag had nine stars, they said.
""It started out with seven stars, one for each of the original states that seceded and formed the Confederacy,"" Paul Quigley, director of Virginia Tech University’s Virginia Center for Civil War Studies, said. ""As more states seceded and joined the Confederacy, more stars were added to the flag."" 
Those stars were arranged in a circle, not horizontally as seen atop the government websites. The Confederate flag also had one white and two red bars, far fewer bars than the government flag icon.
Because the flag’s similarity to the traditional Stars and Stripes caused confusion on the battlefield, the Confederacy in 1863 switched to the Second National Flag, known as the ""Stainless Banner,"" Quigley said. That flag arranged 13 stars in a St. Andrews Cross.
Scot Guenter, director of the Flag Research Center, a Houston-based group, said the flag icon on U.S. government sites is not an actual flag used by the government or the Confederacy, and was simply a design choice.

""Unfortunately, ramifications of using a variant of the true national flag that is just made up by an artist for looks didn’t even occur to whoever did this,"" Guenter said.
Kevin Levin, an author and historian, told PolitiFact he noticed many Bluesky social media users, including prominent people he respects, sharing the Confederate flag claim. He wrote two articles on Substack, an online platform for writers and journalists, debunking the claim.
Levin wrote that many people defending the claim pointed to a photo of a flag for sale on a website called Historical Americana Co. That flag had nine stars arranged horizontally and nine stripes. The site described it as a ""post Civil War re-union UCV Flag.""
UCV stands for United Confederate Veterans, a group that was formed in 1889 and dissolved in 1952. Levin wrote that the veterans group did not create its own flag, and no promotional material from the group shows the flag offered for sale.
Levin told PolitiFact that he’s never seen that flag before, nor have any experts he’s asked in recent days. Quigley also said he had not seen that flag before.
""I can say with confidence that it's not a Confederate veterans flag at all,"" Levin said.
Shae Smith Cox, a Texas A&M University assistant history professor who researches the Civil War, said that the flag for sale appears to be homemade and created for a United Confederate Veterans reunion, possibly during the ""memory phase"" of the Confederacy, when she said Union and Confederacy groups competed over how the Civil War would be remembered.
""There were no regulations on what people could create for that phase,"" Smith Cox said. 
The flag’s seller estimated the flag is from 1900 to 1920, which would be in that era, Smith Cox said, adding that 1913 marked the Battle of Gettysburg’s 50th anniversary. 
Our ruling
Social media posts claimed that the Trump administration, while updating federal webpages, added a nine-star flag representing the Confederacy atop each website. 
The flag icon has been used on government sites since 2017, said a spokesperson for the General Services Association, which guides federal website standards. The flag had only nine stars because of space, and it has no relation to any current or past U.S. flag, the spokesperson said.
Civil War experts told PolitiFact the nine-star flag bears no resemblance to Confederate flags. The first Confederate national flag had a varying number of stars corresponding with the number of states that had seceded from the union. Some versions had nine stars, but they were arranged in a circle, not horizontally like the government website flag.

President Donald Trump told reporters Feb. 2 that the U.S. Agency for International Development, aka USAID, is ""run by a bunch of radical lunatics, and we're getting them out."" Billionaire business owner Elon Musk, who oversees a government cost-cutting commission, is leading an effort to shut down the agency.
USAID, the U.S. government’s international humanitarian and development arm, leads U.S. efforts in many countries to provide food and medicine and supports developing countries’ economic growth. 
U.S. Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., appearing Feb. 2 on CBS’ ""Face the Nation,"" said when it comes to USAID funding, ""10 to 30 cents on the dollar is what actually goes to aid. So there's not the right amount of command and control that's going on with the way that it's set up currently."" 
Mast’s interview comments left viewers with the impression that most of the funding doesn’t go to people in need.

""I mean, you could, you could almost say — this is a little bit hyperbole — but there's probably more dollars that go towards state dinners around the (Washington) D.C. Beltway than what actually goes into rice and beans abroad,"" Mast said. But he said during the Trump administration, ""It's going to be 99.99% of cents on the dollar actually go towards what it's intended, instead of people around the Beltway.""
The 10 to 30 cents number Mast cited is what USAID said it gives to local organizations in foreign countries. But Mast mischaracterizes what happens with the rest of the money. 
A January USAID report recapping 2024 said that about 12.1% of all USAID funding goes directly to local organizations in foreign countries, including nongovernmental, private sector and government partners. The rest of the funding is distributed through international organizations and companies, some of which are based in the U.S., that spend it on food, medicine and other assistance in developing countries or pass it to organizations based in those countries, said George Ingram, senior fellow in the Center for Sustainable Development at the Brookings Institution, a think tank. 
Former U.S. Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-N.J., who served as assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor in the Obama administration, disputed Mast’s statement.
""Mast is referring to the ‘localization’ percentage — the share of USAID funds that reach the needy through small local organizations,"" versus through large global humanitarian organizations, Malinowski wrote Feb. 3 on X.
Mast’s office did not respond to our emailed request for his evidence. 
What will happen with USAID?
USAID’s future remained uncertain Feb. 5. A message on the agency’s website said that all agency personnel will be placed on leave Feb. 7 with some exceptions. We contacted the agency Feb. 3 for comment but received no reply.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters Feb. 3 that he is the agency’s acting administrator but had delegated the authority to someone else. Also Feb. 3, Rubio on Fox News accused USAID of ""rank insubordination,"" adding, ""We had no choice but to bring this thing under control."" He seemed open to reforming USAID rather than abolishing it.
""American foreign assistance programs are not charity; they are strategic investments that directly advance U.S. security, economic interests, and global influence,"" said Elisha Dunn-Georgiou, president and CEO of the Global Health Council, an agency that works with more than 130 organizations across 150 countries. 
How USAID funding is distributed
Experts on USAID said Mast likely was referring to the January report about the agency’s efforts to direct more funding to local partners. 
The report says in 2024, ""USAID provided $2.1 billion directly to local non-governmental, private sector and government partners, or 12.1 percent of USAID’s acquisitions and assistance (A&A) and government-to-government (G2G) funding.""  
That number falls within Mast’s cited range of 10 to 30 cents on the dollar. But that ""doesn’t mean that’s all that goes to the country,"" said Jen Kates, an expert on global health at KFF, a U.S. health policy organization.
Here’s how federal foreign aid is distributed: Congress appropriates funding, often for a specific program such as HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, nutrition or maternal health. But Congress often doesn’t dictate which organizations receive the money. 
The money then flows to U.S. agencies including USAID, which distributes aid mostly through what it calls ""implementing partners,"" such as private contractors, nonprofit organizations, foreign governments, international organizations and other U.S. government agencies, according to the Congressional Research Service. 
Those partners are often based in the U.S. In 2024 more than $1 billion of USAID funding went to American small businesses.

By Maria Ramirez Uribe • February 14, 2025
A single organization can receive USAID money to provide tuberculosis prevention treatment, malaria medicines or antibiotics in several foreign countries. These nonlocal organizations are not counted in that 12% figure.
The process is not new; foreign aid has been distributed this way during Democratic and Republican administrations, including Trump’s first term. 
USAID set a goal in 2021 to increase the share of aid that goes to local partners, and that had bipartisan support. 
How the claim spread 
Before Mast commented about USAID, other similar claims cited a Jan. 7 PBS interview that briefly quoted Walter Kerr, co-executive director of the nonprofit organization Unlock Aid. Kerr said, ""It’s actually less than 10% of our foreign assistance dollars flowing through USAID is actually reaching those communities."" 
Unlock Aid, which formed in 2021, advocates for improvements to U.S. aid, did not respond to our emails requesting comment. 
Musk and Republican Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah, reshared the PBS interview, seeming to cite Kerr’s comments as evidence of USAID corruption.
Our ruling
Mast said when it comes to USAID, ""10 to 30 cents on the dollar is what actually goes to aid."" 
Mast appeared to be referring to a USAID report on 2024 funding that said about 12.1% of the agency’s money goes directly to small local organizations in foreign countries. 
But money provided to local partners is only one portion of the aid. The rest of the money is distributed through ""implementing partners"" —  organizations and companies that operate internationally and which are often based in the U.S. The implementing partners spend the money on food, medicine and other assistance in developing countries or pass it to local organizations based in those countries.

The Facebook post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)

Musk, who has taken a leading role in President Donald Trump’s administration, has criticized U.S. aid to Ukraine and elsewhere. Leading the Department of Government Efficiency, a nongovernmental advisory board that Trump tasked with cutting federal costs, Musk has gained access to the U.S. Treasury’s payment system and is working to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development, an independent government organization codified in law that provides humanitarian and disaster aid abroad. 
A freeze on most foreign assistance has not stopped U.S. military aid to Ukraine, Zelenskyy said Jan. 25. But humanitarian organizations in Ukraine have had to halt services as their funding has stopped.
Here’s why claims of money laundering in Ukraine don’t hold up. 
Congressional funding
Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Congress has passed five bills to aid Ukraine’s war effort, totalling nearly $175 billion. Executive action and supplemental appropriations have provided additional funding. 
That money was not wired directly to Ukraine’s government, though. A Council on Foreign Relations breakdown shows that out of the $175 billion Congress has appropriated, about $100 billion worth of aid is being sent to Ukraine. The rest is funding U.S. activities associated with the war and other countries in the region, the Council on Foreign Relations said. 
The aid to Ukraine comes mostly as weapons shipments and other military support. Only about $33 billion was dedicated to direct budget support, the Council on Foreign Relations reported. About $70 billion of the value going directly to Ukraine is in weapons, equipment and other military support. 
A large portion of the money to support Ukraine’s war effort is spent in the U.S., Mark Cancian, an analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank said in a 2023 analysis: It is going to domestic weapons manufacturers to produce weapons for Ukraine and to replace equipment that was already sent from American stockpiles. 
""Funding of US agencies, most of the funding for US military forces, most of the military equipment backfill and Ukrainian equipment purchases, and a part of the humanitarian assistance stay in the United States,"" Cancian said in the 2023 article.
Also, not all of the money dedicated for Ukraine has been spent yet, and Zelenskyy in the circulated video appeared to be discussing the funding the country has received to date. According to the Special Inspector General for Operation Atlantic Resolve, the multiagency watchdog that oversees Ukraine funding, $86.7 billion of the $130 billion obligated to Ukraine had been disbursed by Sept. 30, 2024. 
What Zelenskyy said
In the AP interview, Zelenskyy said the actual military assistance Ukraine has received to fight the war is lower than the top-line dollar figure in the aid packages.
The AP has posted portions of the interview, but Zelenskyy’s office posted the full hourlong video on its YouTube page in Ukrainian. A clip from that interview spread on social media with English captions. The video has a label from ""@Smotri_Media,"" a Russian Telegram group.  
In the clip’s English translation, Zelenskyy said that the country received ""just over"" $75 billion in military aid. He noted that areas other than the military received U.S. aid.

""One-hundred billion (dollars) of these 177, or 200, some people even say, we have never received,"" Zelenskyy said, according to the translation of the clip. ""We are talking about specific things, because we got it not with money but with weapons. We got $70 something billion worth of it. There is training, there is additional transport. There are not only prices for weapons, there were humanitarian programs, social et cetera.""
It was not clear what exactly Zelenskyy was including in his accounting of the military support Ukraine has received, but his comments align with the public data on how Ukraine aid is being spent. 
The money is not missing or laundered, as some posts claimed. It’s being spent as Congress intended: on U.S. weapons manufacturing, nonmilitary support in Ukraine and support elsewhere in the region.
That’s not to say that Ukrainian aid is never misappropriated. In 2024, Ukraine’s security services investigated Ukrainian defense officials over alleged corruption in a $40 million arms purchase. But Zelenskyy’s statements aren’t evidence of widespread fraud or money laundering in Ukraine aid. 
Inspectors general from the Defense and State departments and the U.S. Agency for International Development have overseen Ukraine aid and have published dozens of audits and assessments of funding programs since 2022. Their review has uncovered no widespread abuse of aid to Ukraine. The U.S. State Department said in August ""there remains no credible evidence of illicit diversion of U.S.-provided defense equipment, direct budget support, or humanitarian assistance from Ukraine.""
The Fraud and Corruption Investigative Working Group, under the special inspector general for Ukraine oversight, opened 61 investigations and closed 30 of them from July to September 2024. 
Our ruling
Social media posts claimed that Zelenskyy ""threw the whole Ukraine money laundering operation under the bus.""
Zelenskyy said Ukraine has received only about $75 billion in military assistance of the $175 billion the U.S. has dedicated to Ukraine aid. That’s in line with what researchers monitoring funding to Ukraine have observed.
A large portion of the money stayed in the U.S. and a smaller portion went to other countries in the region.

On Jan. 30, FBI divers recovered the American Airlines plane’s flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder. Using the data recovered from the planes, National Transportation Safety Board officials released a timeline of the collision. The plane recorded sounds of impact at 8:47:59 p.m. EST, officials said Feb. 1.
We used the Nexis news archive to search CNN reports and transcripts for mentions of ""plane"" and ""Potomac"" and ""collision"" or ""crash"" on Jan. 29. That returned only three results — transcripts of CNN’s shows from 9 p.m. EST to 12 a.m. EST. The transcript of CNN’s ""The Source with Kaitlan Collins"" shows the crash was first reported at about 9:30 p.m.
""Some breaking news this hour, as a small plane has just crashed into the Potomac River, here in Washington, near the Ronald Reagan Airport, just outside Washington, D.C.,"" Collins said. ""That’s according to the D.C. Fire Department.""

Nexis showed no mentions of the crash before Collins’ show — more than half an hour after the crash happened. 
""CNN covered the tragic news on the Potomac after it happened and after local sources and the FAA learned about it and confirmed the news,"" CNN spokesperson Dylan Rose Geerlings told PolitiFact. 
The earliest entry on CNN’s live crash updates web page was posted at 9:40 p.m. Time stamps from CNN’s video reports about the crash show they happened after the collision at 9:49 p.m. and 10:23 p.m. 
Publication data from other news organizations that republish CNN’s wire content corroborate that CNN’s reports came after the crash. 
WRAL, a North Carolina TV news channel and PolitiFact North Carolina partner, posted a CNN story about the crash at 9:42 p.m. — about an hour after the crash. It was the same story featured in several screenshots, titled, ""FAA issues ground stop at Reagan National Airport after plane crashes in Potomac River.""
WRCB, a Chattanooga, Tennessee, TV news channel, also posted the CNN story at 9:40 p.m., according to the page’s metadata.

There’s no evidence that CNN reported on the Jan. 29 fatal collision hours before the event occurred. CNN began reporting on the crash after it happened, according to available report time stamps and a CNN spokesperson’s statement.

Ashley Moody, R-Fla., said at a hearing that a human trafficking tip line stopped reporting cases to law enforcement.

Moody joined fellow lawmakers on the Senate Judiciary Committee to question President Donald Trump’s pick for FBI director, Kash Patel, during his Jan. 30 confirmation hearing.

""It might shock you to know that the National Human Trafficking Hotline that was funded by Congress to report tips to law enforcement, in the last four years decided that they would no longer report tips to law enforcement, that they would take a more victim-centered approach,"" Moody said. ""This fell in line with a lot of what we saw over the last four years, with people saying things like, defund the police, abolish the police, nonsense policies that lead to an explosion in crime.""

In 2024, Moody worked with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to launch a statewide human trafficking tip line after concerns the national hotline was failing to give tips to local law enforcement in a timely way.
PolitiFact found no announcements from the National Human Trafficking Hotline signaling any reporting policy shift over the last four years. The only mention of a potential change came in a 2023 letter that multiple state attorneys general, including Moody, signed that recounted comments from a hotline executive who said the service was ""beginning to transition away"" from serving as a tip line.
Rafael Avalos, a spokesperson for the hotline’s parent company, told PolitiFact in an email that the service has not changed its reporting policies. 
""The instances in which the National Human Trafficking Hotline reports to law enforcement have remained consistent for more than 10 years,"" Avalos wrote.
The hotline says it reports tips to law enforcement and prioritizes obtaining victims’ consent before alerting authorities. The organization, on its website, said it alerts authorities, with or without victim consent, in cases involving imminent harm, child sex abuse or when required by law.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
PolitiFact emailed Moody’s office for evidence but received no reply.
The national hotline’s origins
The National Human Trafficking Hotline was born out of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, a federal law that recognized human trafficking as a crime. Its mandate is to connect human trafficking victims with social services and notify police about potential trafficking ""as requested or required by law"" within 24 hours, according to grant materials The Washington Post cited.
Polaris Project, a nonprofit organization working to reduce sex and labor trafficking in North America, has run the service since 2007. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and private donors fund it.
Federal law requires that the hotline’s phone number be posted in all federal buildings, at every port of entry and in airport, bus station and train station restrooms.

The hotline’s website outlines how the organization decides when to report to authorities. It says the organization ""respects an individual's right to make the decision regarding whether or not to report information about his/her experience to law enforcement or other parties,"" and recognizes that informing law enforcement ""can lead to increased investigations and prosecutions, deter future trafficking, and help victims safely exit situations of human trafficking.""

""Whenever possible, the Trafficking Hotline endeavors to speak directly with victims to discuss the various reporting and referral options and receive explicit consent to make a report on his/her behalf,"" the FAQ page says. ""Consent from a victim and the safety of any individuals involved are the most important factors the Trafficking Hotline considers when weighing whether or not to make a report.""
In a 2020 grant application that The Washington Post reviewed, the Health and Human Services Department wrote that the hotline ""must defer to the individual seeking assistance on if, and when, to report their case to law enforcement, unless required to do otherwise by state-mandated child welfare reporting requirements.""

Other hotlines, such as the National Sexual Abuse Hotline, operate similarly. They keep calls from adult victims confidential and allow victims to decide whether to involve police. 
The hotline received more than 30,000 calls, texts and emails in 2023, according to Polaris data and identified 7,380 unique cases of potential human trafficking. The organization said it refers about a third of those potential cases to police.
Attorneys general claims of recent reporting change
The claim about a recent reporting change could stem from a 2022 meeting between Republican Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch and Polaris CEO Catherine Chen. 

Thirty-six attorneys general signed a 2023 letter to congressional leaders that mentioned the meeting.

""It has recently come to our attention that the National Human Trafficking Hotline (""Hotline""), which Congress has funded for 15 years, is not reporting tips of adult trafficking to state law enforcement except under the limited circumstance where the victim self-reports and affirmatively consents to the Hotline making the report,"" the letter says. ""Not only do we believe this action contravenes one of Congress’ intended functions of the Hotline, but we believe it disrupts the federal-state partnership to end human trafficking and help its victims.""

The letter said Fitch expressed concern during the meeting with Chen about what she said was a lack of tips to Mississippi authorities from the hotline. The letter said Chen told Fitch the hotline takes a victim-centered approach that weighs potential adverse consequences to victims, and that it ""was beginning to transition away from serving as a tip line to concentrate more on connecting survivors with resources.""

PolitiFact asked Fitch for data showing the number of reports Mississippi law enforcement received from tips but received no reply. We found no data on the hotline’s website or elsewhere that details the number of hotline tips reported to law enforcement over the years. 
Fitch’s office told The Washington Post in July 2023 that a 2021 case drew attention to the issue. The Post reported that a man called the hotline after hearing from an out-of-state friend who needed help and the hotline said it couldn’t do anything. Fitch’s office told the newspaper it was alarmed to learn that many third-party tips are not referred to police. 
In interviews with The Post, Polaris acknowledged delays in sharing information received via email and webchats, which they said are intended for ""nonurgent communications,"" during a three-month period of staffing shortages in 2022. But the organization pushed back on other criticism.

In a March 2023 response to the attorneys general letter, Polaris said that concerns raised about its reporting practices were based on a misunderstanding of the hotline’s mission.

""The Trafficking Hotline is not primarily a law enforcement tip line, but rather is authorized by Congress and funded by HHS to ‘assist victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons in communicating with service providers,’"" the statement said.

The hotline ""works with victims to determine what they need to begin to break free and rebuild their lives,"" the statement said. ""This is important because traffickers take consent, choice, and freedom away from victims.""

Polaris said it ""actively partner(s) with hundreds of law enforcement agencies all over the country to ensure countless traffickers are arrested and justice is served.""

In April 2023, U.S. Reps. Laurel M. Lee, R-Fla., and Kathy Castor, D-Fla., introduced the National Human Trafficking Hotline Enhancement Act that would compel the hotline to provide information from calls to law enforcement on request. The bill made it through committee but never got consideration on the House floor. 
PolitiFact asked Polaris whether the attorneys general letter accurately represented Chen’s comments, and if Chen had been describing a policy shift when she met with Fitch. Polaris pointed us to the 2023 Washington Post story with comments from Chen.

""We believe law enforcement has to be part of the solution,"" The Post quotes Chen as saying. ""But this idea that you can mandate that the hotline report every single bit of information whenever it is that law enforcement wants it fundamentally reverses the trust that we’re trying to build with victims and survivors. And they will absolutely stop calling us."" 
Our ruling
Moody said the National Human Trafficking Hotline decided in the last four years to ""no longer report tips to law enforcement"" and to take a more victim-centered approach.
The hotline says it reports tips to law enforcement authorities but prioritizes obtaining victims’ consent first. The organization also alerts authorities, with or without victim consent, in cases involving imminent harm, child sex abuse, or when required by law. The organization said it consistently refers about one-third of human trafficking victims to law enforcement.
PolitiFact found no announcements that signaled a reporting policy change over the last four years. A hotline spokesperson said its policies have remained consistent for more than a decade.
Moody provided no evidence to back her claim.
At PolitiFact, the burden of proof is on the speaker. Lacking evidence to support the claim, we rate it False.

Birthright citizenship refers to the constitutional guarantee, laid out in the 14th Amendment, that all children born in the United States is automatically a U.S. citizen, even if their parents are in the country illegally.
As one of his first acts in office, Trump signed an executive order aiming to end automatic citizenship for children born in the U.S. if neither their mother or father is a U.S. citizen or a lawful permanent resident. The order was immediately challenged in court, and a federal judge temporarily blocked it. The Trump administration has promised to appeal. 
Many Republicans, including members of Congress from Wisconsin, have backed Trump’s position on reinterpreting birthright citizenship.
That includes U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., who discussed the topic Jan. 26 on WISN-TV’s Sunday morning show ""Upfront.""

""We’re one of the very few nations that allowed birthright citizenship,"" Johnson said. ""It’s kind of crazy that this is the policy of the United States.""
""I’m not sure the people passing the 14th Amendment would anticipate wide open borders and this flood of illegal immigrants coming uncontrolled into this country, somewhat incentivized by birthright citizenship,"" he said.
Johnson has previously expressed support for ending birthright citizenship, including at a Senate hearing in December. Then, he said the U.S. is in the ""minority"" of countries that grant it.
With so much attention on birthright citizenship, PolitiFact Wisconsin thought Johnson’s claim was interesting. Is the U.S. an outlier in offering automatic citizenship to children born here?
Let’s take a look.
35 countries have birthright citizenship, including Mexico and Canada
PolitiFact National checked a similar claim from Trump earlier in January, when he falsely said the U.S. is the only country with birthright citizenship. 
About three dozen countries offer automatic citizenship to people born in the country, without restrictions. Countries with restrictions, for example, might require one parent to be born there or a citizen.
We presented the 35 number to Johnson’s office and asked for evidence and context to back up his statement. His spokeswoman, Kiersten Pels, noted that ""35 of 195 (total countries) is only 18 percent of countries.""
""Additionally, Canada and the U.S. are the only two ""developed"" nations (according to IMF) to allow it,"" she said.
That refers to the International Monetary Fund’s distinction between countries with ""advanced economies,"" such as the U.S. and Canada, versus ""emerging and developing economies."" 
Other populous countries that provide unrestricted birthright citizenship, but are under the IMF’s ""emerging and developing"" category, include Mexico and Brazil.

Interestingly, nearly all countries that offer it are in North America, South America or the Caribbean: A product of colonial times, when immigration was encouraged to populate settlements in the ""New World.""
""The American conception of citizenship is informed by the English common law doctrine of jus soli (""right of soil""), in which a person’s nationality at birth is determined by the territory where that person is born,"" according to the Cornell Law School’s Legal Information Institute.
Some countries have recently done away with unrestricted birthright citizenship and added conditions, including Ireland in 2005 and New Zealand in 2006. 
Our ruling
Johnson said the U.S. is one of a ""very few"" nations with birthright citizenship. 
Thirty-five nations have it, but ""very few"" is a pretty subjective number when compared to 195 total countries. PolitiFact Wisconsin took that into account when rating the claim. 
Johnson’s initial claim was True when he said the U.S. is in the ""minority"" of countries that offer it — if 18 percent of countries have it, that’s certainly not a majority. 
But the U.S. isn’t an anomaly either, at least on this side of the world. Canada and Mexico, two very large countries next to the U.S., both have birthright citizenship. 
Our definition of Mostly True is ""the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.""

stated on January 30, 2025 in a press briefing:",“I changed the Obama policy (on hiring air traffic controllers) ... And then Biden came in and he changed it.”,"stated on January 30, 2025 in a press briefing:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/jan/31/donald-trump/trump-faults-dei-hiring-in-plane-crash-and-falsely/,N/A,"Hours after a plane crashed over the Potomac River a few miles from the White House, President Donald Trump held a press briefing in which he blamed his predecessors’ diversity hiring policies as a possible reason for the accident.
Sixty-seven people were presumed dead after an American Airlines passenger jet collided in midair with a U.S. Army helicopter near the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport on Jan. 29. The victims included three U.S. service members aboard the helicopter and everyone aboard the plane, including several young figure skaters, a civil rights lawyer, a newlywed, a pilot and several flight attendants. 
Trump started his Jan. 30 press conference with a moment of silence but pivoted to blame Democratic Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, who Trump said led Federal Aviation Administration diversity programs that inspired the agency to hire unqualified air traffic control employees. Trump said he ended those initiatives in 2017 when he was first elected, but Biden reinstated them.
""I changed the Obama policy, and we had a very good policy,"" Trump said. ""And then Biden came in and he changed it. And then when I came in two days, three days ago, I signed a new order, bringing it to the highest level of intelligence.""
Trump read from a Fox News headline that said the Federal Aviation Administration diversity hiring initiative ""includes focus on hiring people with severe intellectual and psychiatric disabilities."" Trump said it came out a week before he took office, but it was published Jan. 14, 2024. After the press conference, the White House also pointed to an Obama-era biographical assessment for air traffic controllers that critics said prioritized diversity over skills.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
A close look at the FAA’s hiring policies under Obama, Biden and Trump shows that Trump mischaracterized the policies and misled about his actions and the actions of his White House predecessors. He also provided no evidence these policies had any connection to the fatal crash.
The crash has generated renewed concerns about air traffic controller staffing, and the cause remains under investigation. Experts warned against singling out any specific cause of the crash, including diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, less than 24 hours after it occurred. 
Trump expanded — not withdrew — a hiring initiative aimed at people with disabilities
In 2010, Obama’s administration issued an executive order directing federal agencies to hire more people with disabilities, noting that although 54 million people in the U.S. have disabilities, they were underrepresented in the federal workforce. The FAA incorporated the directive into its hiring practices.
That didn’t stop when Trump took office in 2017. Archives of the FAA’s website show the agency continually highlighted its diversity hiring initiatives, including its aims to hire people with disabilities, from 2013 up until Trump reclaimed office in 2025, including throughout Trump’s first term, 2017 to 2021. The page was taken down after Trump was inaugurated Jan. 20.
During his Jan. 30 press conference, Trump maligned a list of ""targeted disabilities,"" including severe intellectual disabilities, saying their emphasis in hiring was unique to his predecessors.  
The term ""targeted disabilities"" is legally defined across the federal government to include ""hearing, vision, missing extremities, partial paralysis, complete paralysis, epilepsy, severe intellectual disability, psychiatric disability and dwarfism.""
Yet in 2019, also under Trump’s first term, the FAA launched a program that aimed to hire 20 people with disabilities to be air traffic controllers, including people who have these ""targeted disabilities.""
In its April 11, 2019, press release, the agency said the program’s key focus was to ""identify specific opportunities for people with targeted disabilities, empower them and facilitate their entry into a more diverse and inclusive workforce.""
After being sworn in for his second term, Trump on Jan. 20 and Jan. 22 signed executive orders aimed at shutting down diversity programs in the federal government, including the FAA. 
The White House confirmed Jan. 30 that Trump’s executive orders did away with those goals.  
Trump ended a controversial Obama-era hiring protocol, but Biden did not reinstate it
In 2014, the Obama administration launched a hiring assessment for air traffic controllers that weighed biographical information such as work and education experience and personality traits as part of a person’s application. The training standards for those who were hired didn’t change.
The assessment did not ask specifically about race, but critics said it was designed to create a more diverse hiring pool at the expense of people who were more qualified or performed better on skills tests. People who failed were not allowed to continue with their application. The FAA introduced the assessment into its hiring protocol in 2014 after it commissioned a study of the barriers racial minorities and women face in becoming air traffic controllers.
Throughout his first term, the Trump administration defended the Transportation Department in a lawsuit over the assessment, which plaintiffs said was discriminatory. Trump’s administration and Biden’s administration both denied in court that the process favored nonwhite applicants. Nevertheless, in 2018, Trump jettisoned its use of the air control biographical assessment, the White House said.
Biden’s administration did not reinstate the assessment, and it has not been a part of the application process since 2018.

“The VIP on the Black Hawk helicopter that crashed was Barack Obama.”
By Sofia Ahmed • January 30, 2025
All air traffic controllers undergo rigorous tests regardless of disability
All air traffic controllers need to pass skills and medical tests to be hired, air traffic management experts told PolitiFact. That didn’t change under either hiring initiative. 
Some disabilities could be disqualifying, Margaret Wallace, an aviation management professor at Florida Institute of Technology, said. Some examples could include heart conditions or neurological issues that might unexpectedly incapacitate a person, or ""poor or no vision, color blindness, poor or no hearing, speech issues that could affect the ability to communicate as needed,"" Wallace said.
Michael McCormick retired from the FAA in 2015 after working under Republican and Democrat administrations, and his work included hiring controllers. He said most of the conditions Trump listed would not meet the agency’s medical standards. 
""The decision to hire a controller is solely based upon aptitude testing, medical certification and security investigation,"" McCormick said. 
Our ruling
As he speculated about the Jan. 29 air crash’s cause, Trump said ""I changed the Obama policy (on hiring air traffic controllers) ... And then Biden came in and he changed it.""
The White House said he was referring to two separate policies. 
The first was a push to hire more people with disabilities that started under Obama. Trump didn’t end the initiative — he expanded the effort by announcing a program aimed at hiring 20 people with disabilities to be air traffic controllers. All air traffic controllers had to pass medical, security and skills tests, regardless of any disability.
The second involved an Obama-era hiring assessment that critics said prioritized diversity over qualifications. Trump was wrong to say that Biden reinstated it — he did not. The assessment has not been in place since 2018, when Trump ended it. But even under that practice, training standards did not change.
Trump conflated policies, obfuscated about his role in them and misled about what they did.
Investigators are still piecing together what led to the crash, a process that could take months. Trump’s leap to connect these policies to what unfolded over the Potomac has no basis.

Trump has suggested eliminating the agency, something that would require congressional action. He ordered a council form to review the agency and deliver a report in six months. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Congress may want to attach conditions, such as a debt limit increase, to California aid.
That’s a ""shameful"" idea, Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Jan. 26 on NBC’s ""Meet the Press.""  
Schiff said Congress should not tie unrelated policy objectives to aid or view disaster aid requests through a partisan lens. 
""And let me say this, as a Californian, we have given more to the recovery of other states than any other state in the union,"" Schiff said.

Responding to Johnson’s comments calling the idea of conditioning California aid ""a common-sense notion,"" U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., echoed Schiff’s sentiment. 
""California is the largest contributor of tax revenue to the federal treasury by far,"" Padilla wrote Jan. 27 on X. ""In 2022 alone, California paid $83 billion more to the federal government than it received. Louisiana took $34.5 billion more federal dollars than it paid. Who is subsidizing whom here?""
We heard similar statements during Trump’s first presidency that California is a ""donor"" state – sending more money to the federal government than it gets in return. We found that Schiff cited a credible academic analysis, which requires some explanation.
How a policy group calculates states’ ‘balance of payments’
A Schiff spokesperson cited analysis from the Rockefeller Institute of Government, a public policy arm of the State University of New York.
For several years, the institute has examined the amount of federal taxes paid by each state’s residents and businesses compared with the amount of federal funding the state receives. The institute refers to the difference of those two numbers as the state’s ""balance of payments"" — a phrase used by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. who was elected to the Senate in 1976 and served 24 years.
The institute’s most recent analysis, published in 2024, showed that California’s balance of payments was greater than any other state in the nation. 
California paid $83.1 billion more in federal taxes than it received from the federal government — a difference greater than any other state when measured in sheer dollars.
The state remained a standout when its population was considered, but it didn’t lead all states. The analysis showed that per capita, Californians paid $2,129 more in federal taxes than they received — that’s more than all but three other states.
So, Schiff was right that California’s federal funding contributions far outweigh what it gets from the federal government in return, but the disaster aid comparison is not as much of a straight line.
""The federal government does not have a separate, dedicated revenue stream exclusively for disaster aid,"" said Joel Tirado, an institute spokesperson. ""FEMA funding comes from general revenue aggregated nationally. So, it isn’t possible to know how much of California’s taxes go to disaster relief specifically.""

“They’re still counting the (2024 election) vote in some areas.”
By Amy Sherman • January 7, 2025
Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the Tax Foundation, a center-right think tank, said policymakers in states such as California sometimes object that their taxpayers are subsidizing other states' taxpayers. But taxpayers are not being treated differently from one state to another. Low-income and high-income taxpayers will receive the same treatment whether they live in California, Nebraska or Arkansas, Walczak said.
""The difference is that California has more high earners than other states, and under a progressive tax and transfer system, high earners face progressively higher tax burdens which serve, in part, to fund programs that benefit lower-income households,"" Walczak said. ""It's not that Californians are subsidizing Arkansans: it's that high earners in California and Arkansas and everywhere else face higher tax burdens than low earners in California and Arkansas and everywhere else."" 
Joshua Sewell, research and policy director at Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan taxpayer advocacy group, said he agreed with Schiff’s general point because California’s economy and its contributions to federal revenues exceed every other state.
""That’s because federal lawmakers have taken those commingled funds generated from the income tax, customs duties, and excise taxes and redistributed them through federal programs,"" Sewell said.
Brad Franklin, a research fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, a nonpartisan think tank, said disaster response programs are implemented by many agencies and departments, which receive most of their funding from supplemental appropriations. 
""That money ultimately comes from tax receipts, and California definitely pays more than its share,"" Franklin said. ""Putting things in per capita terms, as (the Rockefeller report) did, is helpful for thinking about tax burden per person. But total receipts are much more relevant to this question.""
Our ruling
Schiff said, ""As a Californian, we have given more to the recovery of other states than any other state in the union."" 
Schiff was citing the Rockefeller Institute of Government’s analysis of 2022 data. It showed California paid $83 billion to the federal government more than it received. This is not surprising since California is the most populous state. When that difference is calculated per capita, however, the figures showed that, compared with California, three other states paid more to the federal government than they received.

But one crack in his plan is that egg prices haven’t fallen since he took office Jan. 20.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, in her first on-camera press briefing Jan. 28, blamed that on former President Joe Biden’s ""inflationary policies.""
Leavitt said the Biden administration and the U.S. Agriculture Department ""directed the mass killing of more than 100 million chickens, which has led to a lack of chicken supply in this country, therefore a lack of egg supply, which is leading to the shortage.""
Leavitt’s statement is partially accurate about the culling of millions of chickens, but she omitted important details and context about why that happened.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
First, the chickens were killed to prevent the spread of the highly pathogenic avian influenza, or bird flu. 
Second, it’s been long-standing USDA policy to cull an entire flock of birds once bird flu has been detected, including during Trump’s first administration.
White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly referred PolitiFact back to Leavitt’s press briefing comments. 
Egg prices rose under Biden — from $1.60 per dozen in February 2021 to $4.10 in December 2024 (his first and last full months in office), Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows. The Agriculture Department’s January food price outlook said egg prices could rise about 20% more this year.
A spokesperson for Expana, a company that tracks consumer prices, told Axios that a dozen large eggs costs more than $7 in some U.S. regions. 
Since Feb. 8, 2022, when the virus was detected in a commercial flock, more than 147 million birds, including chickens, turkeys, ducks and geese, have died, the USDA said. 
USDA data shows 108 million egg-laying chickens died since 2022, including 13 million in 2025. It’s not clear how many were euthanized or died of the virus.
As of Jan. 29, bird flu has also been detected in dairy cattle, affecting 944 herds in 16 states, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows. Humans have also tested positive for the virus — 67 confirmed cases have been reported in the U.S. and one person has died, the CDC said.
Why are flocks culled?
Experts told PolitiFact the birds are culled to stop the virus from spreading. This protects not only nearby farms and the poultry industry, but public health. A 2002 federal law, the Animal Health Protection Act, gives the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service authority to depopulate herds and flocks to stop the disease’s spread.
""If the birds are dead, the virus dies along with them,"" Russ Daly, a veterinarian for the South Dakota Department of Health and a South Dakota State University professor, said.
Chickens that contract the bird flu virus have little chance of survival; 90% to 100% of them die, usually within 48 hours, the CDC said.
Waiting for the chickens to die naturally allows more viral load into the atmosphere, making it more dangerous for the farm workers and other people who come in contact with the farm, Jada Thompson, a University of Arkansas agricultural economics and agribusiness associate professor, said.
Is this policy new?
Several veterinary professors told PolitiFact that depopulation or ""stamping out"" of sick birds is a long-standing policy and pointed to a 2015 bird flu outbreak during the Obama administration.
Depopulation is the USDA’s primary control and eradication strategy for avian influenza, Yuko Sato, a veterinarian and Iowa State University associate professor, said.

""This latest outbreak is devastating because of the large numbers of premises involved since 2022,"" Carol Cardona, a University of Minnesota veterinary professor and chair of avian health, said. ""But the rule has been there for a very long time now.""
A 2016 USDA report shows that depopulation in 2015 resulted in 50 million birds killed.
A USDA bird flu response plan, updated in May 2017 during Trump’s first administration, incorporates policy guidance based on lessons from influenza outbreaks during the Obama and first Trump administrations. It said ""rapid depopulation of infected poultry is critical to halt virus transmission and must be prioritized.""
During a March 2017 bird flu outbreak, a USDA report said, ""nearly 253,000 birds were depopulated.""  
How does depopulation work?
The USDA encourages farmers who notice signs of illness to contact the USDA or their state veterinarian. Samples taken from the animals are tested and the USDA confirms cases; depopulation usually takes place within 48 hours of the virus’s confirmation.
The USDA pays the farmers for the killed birds.
""It’s in the best interest of the farmer to get this done quickly, as the USDA provides indemnity payments for the euthanized birds, but not the ones that die naturally,"" Daly said.
Our ruling
Leavitt said there’s an egg shortage because the Biden administration ""directed the mass killing of more than 100 million chickens.""
During the Biden administration, more than 100 million egg-laying chickens died from bird flu or were killed to stop the virus’ spread. This led to an egg shortage and higher prices. 
Depopulation is a long-standing practice to prevent bird flu from spreading, agriculture experts said. Government documents show depopulation was the USDA’s bird flu strategy during Trump’s first term and during the 2015 outbreak under Obama.

Kennedy’s financial records show that in 2024, Wisner Baum paid Kennedy $856,559 for his consultant work.
In 2023, Kennedy earned $1,589,829 for his work at Wisner Baum, records show.
The documents don’t say for which cases Kennedy received compensation. A Wisner Baum spokesperson said in a statement responding to Warren’s hearing remarks that the law firm has not compensated Kennedy for vaccine cases. Wisner Baum said it has paid Kennedy only for cases related to the herbicide Roundup and 2018 California wildfires. Kennedy’s bio on Wisner Baum’s website lists his work on these cases, and the lawsuits against Merck.
As Health and Human Services secretary, Kennedy would oversee the Food and Drug Administration, an agency that regulates companies such as Merck and Monsanto, which produces Roundup.
Warren’s office said in a statement that the money Kennedy earned from Monsanto-related cases shows he has already profited from lawsuits against an entity he would oversee.

The first jury trial against Merck’s Gardasil vaccine began Jan. 21 in a state court in Los Angeles. Separately, there is an ongoing federal court case against Merck involving almost 200 lawsuits filed since 2022 in North Carolina, where one of Merck’s vaccine manufacturing facilities is based. Wisner Baum is involved in both cases.
Kennedy wrote in his ethics agreement that, if confirmed as health secretary, he would resign from his Wisner Baum consultant position, which he has held since 2016. However, Kennedy said he will continue to receive compensation from the firm for certain cases.
""I am entitled to receive 10% of fees awarded in contingency fee cases referred to the firm,"" Kennedy wrote in his ethics agreement. ""I am not trying these cases, I am not an attorney of record for the cases, and I will not provide representational services in connection with the cases during my appointment to the position of Secretary.""
Kennedy wrote that, if confirmed, he will receive one final payment from Wisner Baum for all completed cases involving the U.S. government. This includes claims filed under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, a federal program established in 1986 that allows people who say they were injured by vaccines to seek compensation. The disclosure documents did not say how much that payment is expected to be.
For ongoing and future legal cases involving the U.S. government, Kennedy wrote that he will not receive payment. However, if the Department of Health and Human Services’ ethics office says the government is not a party in a case and doesn’t have a ""direct or substantial interest,"" the ethics agreement said, then Kennedy can collect contingency fee interest from Wisner Baum.
So, if Kennedy is confirmed as health secretary, he could receive substantial compensation from Wisner Baum for his previous referral work in the event the law firm wins or settles its cases against Merck.
Following the hearing, Kennedy submitted written answers to the committee’s follow-up questions. In it, he wrote that he had not yet received compensation from Wisner Baum related to any lawsuit against Merck related to Gardasil. ""An amendment to my Ethics Agreement is in process, and it provides that I will divest my interest in any such litigation,"" he said.

When asked if he or any family members ""ever received, or expect to receive, any compensation from Wisner Baum from any lawsuit against Merck related to Gardasil,"" Kennedy wrote he was amending his ethics agreement to send any proceeds from the suit to go to his son. Kennedy did not say which son, although his son Conor Kennedy is an attorney at Wisner Baum.

Donald Trump
stated on January 7, 2025 in a press conference
“They’re still counting the (2024 election) vote in some areas.”
By Amy Sherman • January 7, 2025
Government documents show that Kennedy resigned from his positions as chairman and chief legal counsel for Children’s Health Defense in December 2024. He earned $326,056 in salary and benefits from the antivaccine group for three months of work in 2023 before taking an unpaid leave of absence April 1, 2023. A few days later, on April 5, 2023, Kennedy filed candidacy paperwork with the Federal Election Commission for his 2024 presidential run.
Kennedy has made numerous false claims about vaccines, including ones that protect against COVID-19 and HPV. These falsehoods were part of Kennedy’s presidential campaign of conspiracy theories that PolitiFact named the 2023 Lie of the Year.
Kennedy has said receiving the HPV vaccine Gardasil increases cervical cancer risk. There’s no evidence for that. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — an agency Kennedy will oversee if confirmed as Department of Health and Human Services secretary — said the HPV vaccine is safe and effective in preventing HPV infection. The CDC recommends two doses of the vaccine at ages 11 to 12.
The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia said that ""because the HPV vaccine is made using only a single protein from each type of the virus, it can’t cause HPV infection, and, therefore, it can’t cause cervical cancer or other cancers.""
Our ruling
Warren said Kennedy ""made $2.5 million off suing one of the entities that (he would be regulating) and plans to keep getting a take of every lawsuit in the future.""
Warren was referring to Kennedy’s consulting work for Wisner Baum. Kennedy’s financial records show he earned more than $2.4 million over two years from his work referring cases to Wisner Baum.
On its website, Wisner Baum touts Kennedy’s work on its vaccine-related litigation against Merck as well as on other cases. However, it’s not clear from Kennedy’s financial records which legal cases Wisner Baum has paid him for. The law firm asserts it has compensated Kennedy only for non-vaccine related litigation, including for cases related to the herbicide Roundup, which is owned by a company the FDA regulates.
If confirmed as health secretary, Kennedy said in an ethics agreement that he would continue to receive compensation from the law firm for certain legal cases. He said he would receive one last payment from Wisner Baum for his prior work on government-related cases, but would otherwise stop receiving payment for cases involving the U.S. government.
It is possible that adhering to that promise would still leave room for Kennedy to receive payment from cases related to companies he regulates, if the Department of Health and Human Services’ ethics office determines the lawsuits don’t involve the U.S. government.
In answer to follow-up questions to the committee, Kennedy later said he was amending his ethics agreement to divest his interest in any such litigation and said he would give future proceeds from such lawsuits to his son. 
Warren’s claim is partially accurate — Kennedy has received $2.4 million related to lawsuits, some of them involving entities he would regulate as health secretary, and an ethics agreement said he expects to continue to receive payment from a law firm engaged in suing pharmaceutical companies, although Kennedy later said he would change that to send any such payment to his son instead. But Warren omitted this important context: Kennedy’s financial disclosures don’t make clear what lawsuits he was paid for. The Wisner Baum law firm says Kennedy has been compensated only for non-vaccine-related cases.
The available evidence for this claim fits our definition of Half True.

UPDATE, Jan. 31, 2025: This story has been updated to include information from written documents that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. submitted to senators following his Jan. 29 hearing.

The Department of Government Efficiency, an advisory board, and the Office of Management and Budget ""found that there was about to be $50 million taxpayer dollars that went out the door to fund condoms in Gaza,"" Leavitt said Jan. 28, while discussing the need for a pause on most federal aid. 
A day later, Trump repeated the claim. 
""We identified and stopped $50 million being sent to Gaza to buy condoms for Hamas. $50 million,"" Trump told reporters Jan. 29. ""You know what has happened to them? They've used them as a method of making bombs.""
Trump was likely referring to a February 2020 Jerusalem Post article that said Hamas had been launching improvised explosive devices in condoms.

But there’s no evidence that the U.S. had earmarked or spent $50 million for condoms for Gaza. A State Department spokesperson said on X that the freeze stopped $100 million in funding to Gaza which included funding for contraception. But the emergency relief group that, according to news outlets, would have received that aid, told PolitiFact it did not use U.S. funding for condoms.
There is a U.S. program that provides contraceptives internationally — and it spent $60 million worldwide in one year — but Gaza was not among the recipients, a 2024 U.S. Agency for International Development report said.
Here’s what we know about the funding the White House froze to Gaza, and the funding the U.S. gives other countries for contraceptives.
White House stopped $100 million of health aid to Gaza
State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in an X post that the department ""prevented $102 million in unjustified funding to a contractor in Gaza, including money for contraception.""
The state Department declined to say on the record what the full scope of those grants was, and it did not provide documentation PolitiFact requested before deadline. 
Multiple news outlets reported that state department officials said the administration stopped two $50 million tranches of funding for the International Medical Corps’ work in Gaza. The funding ""included"" family planning programming, which can include contraception, sexual health care and sexually transmitted disease prevention.
The International Medical Corps operates a range of emergency health services in Gaza, but spokesperson Todd Bernhardt told PolitiFact it has not used U.S. funding to buy or distribute condoms in Gaza. The organization is not focused on contraception, and there’s no evidence that $50 million of the funding was intended to pay for condoms. 
The International Medical Corps operates two field hospitals in Gaza, Bernhardt said, which serve around 33,000 civilians per month. It performs emergency maternal and newborn care and has helped deliver about 5,000 babies since the war in Gaza began, Bernhardt said. It operates a neonatal intensive care unit and a stabilization center for severely malnourished children. 
The group also provides care in pediatrics, orthopedics, pulmonology and cardiology, Bernhardt said.
""If the stop-work order remains in place, we will be unable to sustain these activities beyond the next week or so,"" Bernhardt said.
Since the war in Gaza began in October 2023, the International Medical Corps has received $68 million to support its operations, Bernhardt said. We weren’t able to review the details of the grant Leavitt referred to, but it is unlikely the group would receive close to three-fourths of all the funding it’s received so far for condoms alone. And the State Department did not respond to our request for more details on the grant. 
The Trump administration on Jan. 29 withdrew its memo that directed a freeze on most federal aid a day after a judge blocked the effort, but Leavitt said on X the funding freeze was still in place. The State Department did not say whether the planned Gaza aid would resume. 
No contraceptives funding went to Gaza in fiscal year 2023, the latest available data
For decades, the U.S. has invested in reproductive health and family planning programs worldwide. Public health groups distribute condoms in low-income countries primarily to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV.

From the U.S. Agency for International Development funding, “10 to 30 cents on the dollar is what actually goes to aid.”
By Amy Sherman • February 5, 2025
The U.S. ""is the largest donor to (family planning/reproductive health) in the world. It is also one of the largest purchasers and distributors of contraceptives internationally,"" according to a 2024 KFF report. 
The U.S. spends about $600 million annually on international family planning and reproductive health programs globally, the KFF report said. That includes things like birth spaces, STD testing, prenatal and postnatal care, and other interventions beyond contraception. 
According to USAID, it partners with 41 countries for its family planning and reproductive health program. Neither Israel nor Gaza and the West Bank are on the list. 
In fiscal year 2023, which ended in September 2023, the U.S. government spent $60 million on contraceptive care which includes condoms, a 2024 USAID report said. A small portion of that — $8.2 million — was spent on male and female condoms, with the rest going to other contraception methods. 
The majority of the funding, $54.3 million went to countries in Africa. The Middle East, where Gaza is, got the smallest funding share — about $45,000. All the funding to the Middle East went to Jordan; the report didn’t mention any funding to Israel or Gaza.
Most of USAID’s Family Planning Program funding is used on contraceptives other than condoms such as oral contraceptives, injectable contraceptives and contraceptive implants. Around $7 million went to condoms for men.
Gaza has around 2.14 million people, according to the CIA. If the U.S. spent $50 million on condoms it would have spent around $23 on condoms per person in Gaza or about $46 per male in Gaza. On average, condoms cost about $1 each, according to Planned Parenthood. That does not include a likely lower price for bulk purchases. 
Our ruling
Leavitt said officials found ""there was about to be $50 million taxpayer dollars that went out the door to fund condoms in Gaza."" 
The White House and State Department didn’t provide evidence the funding it blocked was intended solely for condoms. A State Department spokesperson said that the freeze stopped $100 million in funding to Gaza that included funding for contraception. But there’s no evidence  the emergency relief group that would have received that aid would have used it for condoms; a spokesperson for the group said it has not used any U.S. aid so far to procure or distribute condoms.
A separate U.S. program that provides contraceptives internationally spent $60 million worldwide in one year, but Gaza was not among the recipients.

There are problems with this TikTok video’s claims. First, Vance has not visited North Carolina since he was sworn in as vice president Jan. 20. (In December, after Trump’s victory, Vance and his wife, Usha visited Fairview, North Carolina, to meet with first responders and evaluate hurricane damage and recovery efforts.)
On Jan. 27, Vance traveled to Damascus, Virginia, to survey Hurricane Helene’s destruction and meet with local leaders to discuss the continuing response. In remarks there, Vance said the Virginia trip was his first as vice president. 
""This is, I think, my seventh day on the job,"" he said. ""And this is an incredible place to have my first official trip. I heard so many good stories of good people helping their neighbors rebuild.""
He said he’d heard countless stories of people volunteering time and money to help people repair or reconstruct their homes and businesses.
During his remarks, Vance criticized what he characterized as unhelpful federal bureaucracy. Some North Carolinians have complained that FEMA’s response — including the Transitional Sheltering Assistance program, which provides the hotel stays — is confusing, frustrating and too slow. 
Trump, meanwhile, visited North Carolina on Jan. 24 and promised the administration would increase ""housing solutions"" for the region that extend beyond measures such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s temporary hotel stays.  
Neither Vance nor Trump said hurricane victims in Virginia or North Carolina would be provided furnished apartments, however. 
When we searched using Google and the Nexis news archive, we found no credible reports or information supporting claims that Vance or the Trump administration had provided furnished apartments for Hurricane Helene victims in North Carolina.

When the claim circulated on X, community notes appended on the posts said the posts might have confused North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein’s Jan. 2 executive order to increase the state’s temporary housing supply with something the Trump administration had introduced. 
In one of his first acts as governor, Stein, a Democrat, waived procurement regulations and authorized the North Carolina Department of Public Safety to buy up to 1,000 transportable temporary housing units. Some of those units began arriving Jan. 17, WLOS-TV in Asheville, North Carolina, reported.
Stein’s office said questions about the federal government’s efforts should go to FEMA. PolitiFact contacted FEMA and received no response before publication. 
Justin Graney, North Carolina Emergency Management spokesperson, said the agency knew nothing about the TikTok video’s claim. 
""(North Carolina Emergency Management) is unaware that any disaster survivors reported to be living in tents have been provided with furnished apartments,"" he said, though he acknowledged it was possible such housing accommodations might be tied to a FEMA program. ""It is important to note that those living in tents have been approached multiple times by local government officials, state government officials, and FEMA personnel and have been provided with information on available programs and resources.""
He encouraged anyone living in a tent who needs assistance to call the North Carolina Disaster Case Management Program at 1-844-746-2326.

Trump visited North Carolina on Jan. 24, four months after Hurricane Helene made landfall and damaged more than 73,000 homes.
""Earlier this month, the Biden administration kicked 2,000 displaced North Carolinians out of their temporary housing into freezing 20-degree weather,"" Trump said in Swannanoa. He promised that ""under the Trump administration, the days of betrayal and neglect are over.""
The White House did not respond to our request seeking evidence. The number Trump cited matches a Jan. 11 Fox News report that said 2,000 North Carolina residents no longer met FEMA’s temporary housing eligibility requirements, and housing would continue for 3,600 households. 
Trump has a point in that several hundred North Carolina storm victims were told in January they had to leave their FEMA-funded hotels or motels because they no longer met the criteria for the stays. He misleads by overstating the number who lost eligibility, by omitting that they received three weeks’ notice to find new housing and by saying they were ejected into the cold.

Reviewing temporary housing eligibility after a disaster and removing some people from the program is a standard FEMA procedure that also happened during his presidency.
Trump has floated the idea of eliminating FEMA, which would require congressional action. On Jan. 24, Trump ordered the formation of a council to review FEMA. 
FEMA announced extensions of transitional housing program
FEMA’s Transitional Sheltering Assistance program provides free hotel and motel rooms for disaster victims as they repair their homes or find other housing.
On Dec. 5, a FEMA news release said the temporary housing program in North Carolina was extended to Jan. 11. Of the 10,000 households that had used the program, about half had found longer-term housing. 
The agency reviews the participants’ cases every two weeks to see whether the participants still meet eligibility criteria. 
In January, multiple news reports said the Jan. 11 deadline would leave 2,000 to 3,500 households unsheltered during a snowstorm. (FEMA announced a 24-hour extension because of the storm.) 
About 3,600 households would remain eligible after Jan. 11, Fox reported.
On the night of Jan. 11, FEMA extended the transitional sheltering hotel stays deadline until Jan. 14 and then extended it again until Jan. 25.
North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein wrote a Jan. 16 letter to FEMA asking for an extension until Sept. 30 for eligible households as residents ""are experiencing chaos and uncertainty regarding temporary housing that is untenable.""
FEMA replied Jan. 19 — the Biden administration’s last full day — extending the temporary shelter program until May 26. 
A FEMA spokesperson told PolitiFact that as of Jan. 28, more than 2,600 families remain temporarily housed in hotels or motels. Of those, approximately 740 were notified the weekend of Jan. 18 that they had 21 days to find new housing because they no longer met the criteria for the temporary housing. 
The most common reason people lost eligibility was that an inspector had called three times and received no response, FEMA said. Some people were no longer eligible because they missed an inspection or had checked out of their hotels.
In Buncombe County, home to Asheville and one of the counties hardest hit by the hurricane, 407 households were no longer eligible for temporary housing as of Jan. 11 because FEMA had inspected their homes and deemed them safe to occupy, county spokesperson Lillian M. Govus said. An additional 143 households withdrew from the program and 49 households were homeless before the storm, making them ineligible. As of Jan. 28, 701 Buncombe households remain in the program.
In a Jan. 16 interview with Fox News, Sen. Ted Budd, R-N.C., called on FEMA for better communication with its recipients, saying he had heard from some who believed they were wrongly evicted.

Budd wrote Jan. 14 on X that his office was ""hearing from dozens in (West North Carolina) who have been kicked out of their hotels tonight"" despite the extension. In an X post, Tillis said dozens of people were ""told their hotel vouchers expired despite not having a safe and livable home to go back to.""

Trump said, ""The Biden administration kicked 2,000 displaced North Carolinians out of their temporary housing into freezing 20-degree weather,"" earlier in January. 
We received no information from FEMA that 2,000 people were removed in January. FEMA said on the weekend of Jan. 18, about 740 families were notified that they had three weeks to move out of the agency’s transitional sheltering assistance program because they no longer met eligibility criteria.
Trump omitted the context about why they were removed — because they no longer met eligibility requirements — and that the removals are standard procedure that also happened during other disasters during his first administration. 
FEMA reviews temporary housing participants’ eligibility every two weeks, and households whose homes are deemed habitable or who can’t be reached lose eligibility.

stated on December 3, 2024 in comments to reporters:",North Carolina Republicans “took money out of western North Carolina” with Hurricane Helene relief bill.,"stated on December 3, 2024 in comments to reporters:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/jan/29/roy-cooper/roy-cooper-says-hurricane-helene-relief-bill-took/,N/A,"North Carolina legislators in December enacted a storm relief bill that simultaneously reduced legal powers for the offices of the governor and other seats won by Democrats.
The bill became law Dec. 11 after the Republican-majority state legislature voted to override then-Gov. Roy Cooper’s veto. Cooper, a Democrat, had argued the bill strips money from Hurricane Helene victims, who were still rebuilding after the September storm ravaged western Western North Carolina. 
Before the Legislature voted to override Cooper’s veto, the governor told reporters on Dec. 3 that the bill ""took away the next governor's authority to continue enhanced unemployment payments from people who lost their job because of the storm."" 
""So, they actually took money out of western North Carolina,"" he said.
Cooper made similar claims on social media later that day.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
In an X post, Cooper said the bill ""hurts Western North Carolina by stripping away higher unemployment benefits for people who lost jobs from the storm."" The post also included a clip of Cooper speaking on MSNBC, saying Republicans ""actually took money away from western North Carolina.""
Does the bill really take money away from western North Carolina?
The law ends the governor’s ability to boost unemployment benefits amid a state emergency, something Cooper did after Helene. That could mean that North Carolinians won’t receive higher benefits in the future. But the law doesn’t include a provision that would withdraw any money that has already been allocated to people in the western part of the state. When Cooper made this statement, the bill had not yet become law, so his use of the past tense may have confused some North Carolinians.
It’s also worth noting that unemployment aid is far from the only way the state has been helping Helene victims. Beyond the immediate response that included hundreds of state and federal workers on the ground, the Republican-led state legislature has also approved more than $1 billion in Helene aid relief. That’s a fraction of the nearly $4 billion in aid Cooper called for while governor, though state lawmakers say they plan to do more in the future.
The power in question
Helene hit North Carolina on Sept. 27, bringing 30 inches of rain, causing more than 1,400 landslides. It was the deadliest and most damaging in state history. According to an estimate by the state’s budget director, Helene damaged about 74,000 western North Carolina homes — only about 5% of which were covered by flood insurance.
On Oct. 16, Cooper issued an executive order that raised the maximum weekly unemployment benefit from $350 per week to $600 per week and extended eligibility from 12 weeks to 26 weeks for Helene victims. Cooper cited powers granted to him under the state's Emergency Management Act when announcing the order. The increased amount was available to anyone seeking unemployment benefits in North Carolina — not just Helene victims.
Unemployment benefit payouts increased by more than 10,000 cases after Helene hit North Carolina, according to data provided by the state commerce department.
In August, 19,271 people received benefits. The number dipped to 17,981 in September, then shot up to 27,385 in October and rose to 31,547 by the end of the year.
Republican leaders don’t believe the Emergency Management Act authorizes the governor to boost unemployment benefits, so they included a section in Senate Bill 382 to ""correct a misapprehension of the powers conferred to the governor,"" the bill states. It also says the law ""does not allow for the governor to waive, modify, suspend, or fail to enforce or execute"" the laws related to employment security.
Cooper’s claim that Republicans ""took"" money out of western North Carolina could give the impression that money going to Helene victims, or that was scheduled to go to Helene victims, is being revoked. But that’s not so.
Delayed effect of the bill
The bill says the enhanced employment security benefits won’t end until March 1, when North Carolina’s state of emergency is scheduled to expire.
""This does not take money from Western North Carolina and does not impact a single dollar of unemployment benefits currently flowing to employees in that area,"" Lauren Horsch, a spokesperson for Republican Senate leader Phil Berger, told PolitiFact in a statement.

“So (Los Angeles), Hollywood, and California (get) 100% aid for the next 180 days while Western North Carolina got $750.”
By Madison Czopek • January 16, 2025
Cooper’s office didn’t dispute that the bill leaves the current unemployment benefits untouched, but argued that Helene victims will likely still need the enhanced benefits after March 1, so withdrawing the governor’s ability to increase those payments will have significant consequences for people struggling to rebuild.
Gov. Josh Stein, also a Democrat, is expected to extend the state of emergency beyond March 1, Cooper’s office said last month, before Stein was sworn in. States of emergency for less-devastating hurricanes lasted longer than six months. For example, North Carolina was under a state of emergency for 15 months following 2018’s Hurricane Florence.
""Because Republican legislators are shortchanging western North Carolina recovery, especially the small business grants that are desperately needed to support the economy, residents out west will need enhanced unemployment benefits beyond next March,"" Cooper spokesperson Ben Conroy said.
""The Legislature's shameful decision to rip this power away from future governors only harms North Carolinians who need support to recover from this and future natural disasters,"" Conroy said.
Laura Brewer, a Stein spokesperson, told PolitiFact that the new governor hasn’t decided whether to extend the state of emergency, adding that there are many options ""to help them rebuild and recover, including support for those who have lost their jobs, homes, and businesses.""
Our ruling
Cooper said North Carolina Republicans ""took money out of western North Carolina"" when they passed a Hurricane Helene relief bill last month.
Legislators stripped the governor’s power to enhance unemployment benefits using the state’s Emergency Management Act. 
Cooper has a point in that if the state of emergency is extended without the bill in place, unemployed Helene victims could continue to receive enhanced benefits beyond March 1.
But the bill did not claw back or halt enhanced unemployment benefits that are scheduled to be available through March 1.

stated on January 21, 2025 in a post:","“Under Trump's executive order, every single person in America is now legally classified as female.”","stated on January 21, 2025 in a post:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/jan/29/tweets/no-were-not-all-female-under-trumps-executive-orde/,N/A,"As part of a torrent of Day 1 executive orders, President Donald Trump declared it ""the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female.""

But the order’s definitions of ""male"" and ""female"" led some social media users to wonder whether Trump accidentally categorized all people as women:

""Under Trump's executive order, every single person in America is now legally classified as female,"" a Jan. 21 X post read. ""All embryos begin by developing female sex organs, with male sex organs only replacing them at around 6 weeks of gestation.""

But scientific research and conversations with legal experts showed this claim was off base.
Early fetal development is not as straightforward as the post described. But neither was the wording in Trump’s executive order. It said:
""(d)  ‘Female’ means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell.
""(e)  ‘Male’ means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the small reproductive cell.""
Conception is when a sperm successfully fertilizes an egg, forming a zygote. The single-cell zygote possesses genetic coding related to sex —  typically XX (female) or XY (male) — but it cannot produce its own reproductive cells. 
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
In the first few weeks, a growing embryo has growing gonads that haven’t developed into male or female reproductive structures yet. Around six weeks, genetic coding triggers the growing embryo to start developing testes or ovaries.
Although scientists once theorized that all embryos start developing as females, recent research has determined that neither sex is ""default."" 
Scientists who considered the order said they were perplexed by its juxtaposing ""at conception"" alongside an aspect of sex differentiation that happens only after weeks of gestation. But legal experts were also leery of claims that interpreted the definition to mean all people would be ""legally classified"" as female.
The problem with the executive order’s definition
A person’s ""sex,"" according to scientists, is not easily measured by one factor. Chromosomes, gonads, hormones and genitalia can all contribute to a person’s sex categorization.
And those determinants are not all clear at conception. Nor do they always add up to typical male or typical female anatomy. Research estimates that about 1.7% of the population, for example, has intersex conditions or differences in sex development — cases in which someone’s anatomy does not neatly fit into male or female. 
People born with Klinefelter Syndrome, for example, have XXY chromosomes and although they are typically assigned male at birth, their anatomy is often affected by the additional female chromosome. People with de la Chapelle syndrome have female chromosomes but can develop a penis and be assigned male at birth. People with androgen insensitivity syndrome have male chromosomes, but don’t respond to their body’s naturally produced male hormones. That means genetically a male fetus, with testes and normal testosterone production may develop a vagina and be assigned female at birth and raised as a girl. 
Other conditions result in ambiguous genitalia that do not fall neatly into either sex category.
People with these conditions, therefore, are not accounted for under Trump’s order.
""A lot of other variations might be noticeable at birth if they cause other types of genital differences,"" said Sylvan Fraser Anthony, legal and policy director at Interact, a nonprofit advocating for intersex youth. ""Others will be discovered, you know, not until later.""
Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy officer for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, said political efforts to place people ""into two neat categories does not reflect biological reality."" 
""There are thousands of Americans whose chromosomes, external genitalia, and reproductive capacity do not match with some politician’s notion of how the world should be,"" Tipton said.
The problem with the claim that Trump’s order classifies everyone as female
The assertion that ""all embryos begin by developing female sex organs"" is based on outdated science. 
Scientists in the past theorized that female fetal development was the default pathway, stopped only by the activation of a Y chromosome gene that causes testes to develop. 
But recent research suggests that neither path is ""default"" and the development of both testes and ovaries is complex. More recent research describes reproductive structures in the first few weeks as ""bipotential,"" meaning they are not yet male or female.
Legal scholars also challenged the claim’s notion that Trump’s order would legally affect ""every single person’s"" sex.

stated on January 20, 2025 in remarks
The United States is the only country with unrestricted birthright citizenship.
By Samantha Putterman • January 21, 2025
""There is no such thing as a universal ‘legal’ gender,"" Rose Saxe, the American Civil Liberties Union’s LGBT & HIV Project’s deputy director, said.
State and federal governments’ understanding about a person’s sex and gender essentially depends on however official paperwork — birth certificates, driver’s licenses, passports — describes the person.
And Trump’s new definition of the sexes applies only to interpretation and enforcement of federal law and policy, not state laws. That could mean that people may no longer be able to change their gender markers — the ""M"" or ""F"" denoting male or female — on federal documents such as passports. But state IDs are governed by state laws, which may enable people in some states to get IDs that align with their gender identity. 
How the  Trump administration will enforce the order’s definition is also unclear: When  federal employees submit paperwork for example, Saxe said, will they be asked, ""‘Did you belong at conception to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell?’ Maybe that's what they're going to ask people, or are they just going to have a form that says male or female and ask people to check the box?""

And despite the definition’s wording, Saxe said, a court would be unlikely to adopt the interpretation that the law ""classifies"" everyone as female. 
These definitions might be short-lived. Within 30 days, the order dictates, ""the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall provide to the U.S. Government, external partners, and the public clear guidance expanding on the sex-based definitions set forth in this order."" 
Federal effort to define sex follows similar state-led efforts, but with new language
State lawmakers have so far led the charge to define and redefine sex and gender, and Trump’s effort follows suit. Nine states have explicitly defined sex as binary according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit that tracks LGBTQ+ policy.
Like Trump’s order, nearly all states adopting laws to redefine sex and gender have added definitions that refer to reproductive aspects of sex, the ability to produce sperm and eggs, as the dividing line between the sexes rather than chromosomes or genitalia 
But Trump’s order language is distinct from the state laws in its use of the phrase ""belonging, at conception,"" a likely nod to anti-abortion rights advocates.
During a Jan. 24 March for Life event in Washington D.C., abortion rights opponents celebrated Trump’s inclusion of the phrase ""at conception."" 
""I don’t know if you saw (Trump’s) executive order but it defines life as beginning at conceptions rather than birth,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told the crowd. 
Our ruling
An X post said, ""Under Trump's executive order, every single person in America is now legally classified as female.""

Experts PolitiFact interviewed called the executive order’s definitions of what defines a male and a female as scientifically flawed and legally awkward. But no one believed the order’s language would lead the federal government to classify everyone in the U.S. as female.

This one will ask residents whether to amend the state constitution to include an existing law requiring a photo ID to vote. Enshrining it in the constitution would make it harder for the state Supreme Court to declare it unconstitutional, which Republicans fear because of the court’s current liberal majority. It would also be harder for Democrats to repeal it if they gain control of the Legislature in future years. 
The GOP maintains that the photo ID law has increased security at the ballot box. But experts and advocates say it’s making it more difficult for certain groups of people to vote, such as Black voters in Milwaukee. 
In a news release blasting the attempt to get the voter ID law in the constitution, the public advocacy group Common Cause Wisconsin expounded on that. 
""Wisconsin makes it more difficult for its citizens to vote than almost any state in the nation,"" the group wrote in the release.

Is that accurate? 
Let’s take a look at the evidence. 
Wisconsin voter ID law is stricter than most
When asked to back up the claim, Common Cause Wisconsin Executive Director Jay Heck said he was pulling from the expertise of UW-Madison political science professor Barry Burden, who wrote previously for The Observatory that Wisconsin’s voter ID law is one of the strictest in the country. 
Burden repeated it in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, writing that ""Wisconsin demands more than nearly all of the other states"" when it comes to getting a ballot. 
The National Conference of State Legislatures lists Wisconsin as one of just nine states with ""strict"" photo ID laws used to identify voters. State Rep. Scott Krug, R-Nekoosa, even lauded that status in a Jan. 8 news conference, saying, ""We have one of the hardest ID systems that you can have."" 
In short, pretty much everyone agrees that Wisconsin’s voter ID law is severe. 
But there are other elements of the election process that can make it harder for people to vote — and Common Cause Wisconsin didn’t specify in the statement that the group was referring to voter ID alone. 
So, how does Wisconsin measure up when it comes to other ways to judge voting accessibility? 
Wisconsin ranks as one of the hardest places for voters  
Burden pointed to the Cost of Voting Index, run by Michael Pomante, a research fellow at Claremont Graduate University. The index accounts for 56 laws and policies that dictate the rules people must follow to get registered and cast a ballot, and weights them with a statistical analysis to determine whether they make it easier or harder to do so in a given state. 
Wisconsin has some election laws and policies that are more accessible compared with other states, Pomante said.
For example, voters can register at the polls the day they go to vote, they can register to vote online, they can cast an in-person absentee vote and they can drop their completed absentee ballots off in dropboxes, which were made legal again last July. 
But other restrictions drive our ""cost of voting"" up.

Besides the strict voter ID law, Wisconsin has stringent rules for voter registration drives, does not have automatic voter registration, does not have preregistration for young voters, does not allow all voters to join a permanent absentee ballot list, does not consider Election Day a public holiday and does require a witness’ signature on absentee ballots, Pomante said. 
The state’s ranking also drops because it doesn’t offer early voting, he said. On the index, that’s different from in-person absentee voting, which Wisconsin does have. True early voting functions similarly to voting on Election Day, with multiple sites and evening and weekend hours to cast a ballot, while in-person absentee voting can be more restricted, Pomante said. 
In Wisconsin, the in-person absentee voting experience varies from one municipality to the next, Burden said. Larger cities like Madison offer multiple sites and extended hours, while in smaller communities — much more plentiful around the state, he noted — ""in-person voting before Election Day is not really an option because municipal clerks do not provide it."" 
Not everyone differentiates between the two. The Movement Advancement Project’s Democracy Maps, for example, give Wisconsin credit for an ""adequate early voting period"" of more than seven days. Burden said a more nuanced consideration of the issue would need to investigate the exact hours, days and locations that early and absentee voting are offered in different states. 
Where does all this land Wisconsin on the index? In 2024, Wisconsin had the fifth-highest cost of voting of all 50 states. In other words, it’s the fifth-hardest state to vote in the country, behind New Hampshire, Texas, Arkansas and Mississippi, which was the hardest.  
In 1996 — the year the index goes back to — Wisconsin was ranked the fourth-most-accessible state in the nation for voters. That’s because at that time, the state was among very few that offered same-day voter registration, Pomante said. When other states started adopting it, Wisconsin’s ranking started to drop. 
The state’s most dramatic drop occurred between 2011 and 2015, when former Republican Gov. Scott Walker signed the voter ID requirement into law and it took effect despite a swarm of lawsuits seeking to knock it down. It has continued to fall ever since, figures from the index show. 
Our ruling 
Common Cause Wisconsin said the state makes it more difficult for people to vote than almost any other state in the nation. 
Our voter ID law alone is one of the most stringent in the country — and research shows the state’s other restrictive voting policies make it more challenging to vote compared to most other states.

Ogles wants the amended amendment to say: ""No person shall be elected to the office of the president more than three times, nor be elected to any additional term after being elected to two consecutive terms, and no person who has held the office of the president, or acted as president, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected president shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice.""
That means former President Grover Cleveland, who died in 1908 and served two nonconsecutive presidential terms, would have been the only other former U.S. president eligible to run for reelection after serving two terms under the proposed amendment. 
For the Constitution to be amended, Ogles’ bill would need to be approved by a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate, and then ratified by three-fourths of the states.
