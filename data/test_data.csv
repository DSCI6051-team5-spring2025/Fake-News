"JD Vance
stated on January 12, 2025 in a Fox News interview:","“Some of these (California) reservoirs have been dry for 15, 20 years.""","stated on January 12, 2025 in a Fox News interview:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/jan/17/jd-vance/fact-check-have-some-california-reservoirs-been-cl/,,"Asked about the emergency response to California’s wildfires, Republican Vice President-elect JD Vance criticized the state’s Democratic governor for making ""very bad decisions over a very long period of time,"" and pointed to the condition of the state’s reservoirs as an example. 
""Some of these reservoirs have been dry for 15, 20 years,"" Vance said on Fox News Sunday as he spoke about Gov. Gavin Newsom. ""The fire hydrants are being reported as going dry while the firefighters are trying to put out these fires. There is a serious lack of competent governance in California, and I think it’s part of the reason why these fires have gotten so bad.""
During the height of fighting the Palisades fire on Jan. 7 and Jan. 8, water demand outpaced the amount of water flowing to hydrants, and some hydrants went dry. A nearby city reservoir was empty for repairs when the fire broke out, the Los Angeles Times reported Jan. 10. 
But Vance’s description of decades-long dry reservoirs is misleading. Experts on California’s water management told us they were not aware of any major reservoir that has been dry for 15 years or more. The state-managed reservoirs in Southern California are, in general, at or above their historic average storage for January. 
The Santa Ynez reservoir that supplies drinking water to Los Angeles’ local system has been empty since February 2024 because it needed repairs. The reservoir can hold up to 117 million gallons. But it’s managed by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, not the state, and it’s used primarily for drinking water.

Had the reservoir been full, it may have supplied more water pressure to the Pacific Palisades during the height of the firefighting and slowed the rate at which hydrants ran dry, said Steve Margulis, the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering chair at the University of California, Los Angeles.
But that reservoir hasn’t been closed for 15 years, so it’s unclear which reservoirs Vance was referring to.
California has close to 1,500 surface reservoirs, a 2018 Public Policy Institute of California Water Policy Center report said. Most are small and managed by local governments, said Jay Lund, the vice director of the Center for Watershed Sciences and a civil and environmental engineering professor at the University of California, Davis. 
Some reservoirs are intentionally left at low levels or empty, Lund said, because they’re used for flood control. But those reservoirs fill during heavy rainfall to prevent flooding. 
It’s possible that a local reservoir somewhere in the state has been shut down for several years, but we did not find an example, and President-elect Donald Trump and Vance’s transition team did not provide examples when PolitiFact reached out for comment. 
""I am sure there are very small reservoirs that have been empty for some time, for one reason or another,"" said Thomas Harter, a hydrology professor at the University of California, Davis. ""No major reservoirs have been empty for that long.""
Small reservoirs that serve local areas outside of Los Angeles have no relation to the city’s water system.
Los Angeles’ water comes from local aqueducts, groundwater and water purchased from Southern California’s Metropolitan Water District. The water district’s water is supplied by the Colorado River, groundwater and the State Water Project that moves water from the north to the dryer southern end.
State Water Project Deputy Director John Yarbrough said in a statement to PolitiFact that there are ""no dry reservoirs in the State Water Project system."" Most of the major reservoirs tracked by the California Department of Water Resources are at or above their historic average storage. 
In a Jan. 12 interview with NBC News, Newsom rebutted Trump’s criticisms of Northern California water management and described Southern California’s reservoirs as ""completely full."" Although the nearby state reservoirs aren’t completely full, they’re close. The state-managed reservoirs in Southern California have stores above 75% of their total capacity.
Newsom’s critics accused the governor of misleading by not mentioning the local empty Santa Ynez reservoir. After the interviewer noted the empty local reservoir, Newsom said, correctly, that the reservoir is not related to the state and federal water management system that Trump criticized early in the wildfire response.

“An ICE minivan was reportedly set on fire in Philadelphia.”
By Sofia Ahmed • February 19, 2025
Newsom on Jan. 10 called for an investigation into why the Santa Ynez reservoir was empty when the Palisades fire broke out. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power said in a Jan. 11 press release it will conduct an investigation into water resiliency and how to better respond to climate-related disasters. 
Regardless of the amount of water in the pipes, though, hydrants and local water infrastructure are built for routine structure fires, not large wildfires that consume entire neighborhoods. The water may have slowed the fire in some places, but experts said it likely would not have dramatically contained the fire. 
Margulis told us it’s unclear how much that extra water would have helped, and the reservoir’s absence should be part of a post-fire investigation. 
""Any additional reservoir would have helped maintain supply and pressure in the area that draws water from it for a longer period of time, but to what extent remains to be determined,"" he said. ""However, given the conditions, once the fire was ignited and started to spread quickly, it is unlikely that the extra supply would have made a major difference in containing it.""
The Department of Water and Power in February 2024 shut down the Santa Ynez reservoir because of damage to its cover. The reservoir supplies drinking water to the city, so it’s subject to environmental regulations to prevent contamination. 
The department said the repairs are ""subject to the city charter’s competitive bidding process which requires time."" The Los Angeles Times reported a $130,000 contract was issued to a Lakeside firm to repair the cover.
Upcoming investigations may determine that local government or management shortcomings contributed to a delay in repairing the reservoir. But the reservoir was shut down for less than a year, not 15 years or more. And it’s not indicative of a statewide problem with reservoirs.
Our ruling
Vance said that some reservoirs in California ""have been dry for 15, 20 years."" 
Experts said that statewide, there are no major reservoirs that have been dry for more than 15 years, and most of California’s reservoirs are above their historic average storage.

One reservoir that supplies water to the Pacific Palisades area has been shut down for nearly a year, and that may have eased the water pressure shortage during the height of the firefighting. 
But Vance’s statement is exaggerated. It contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts. That’s our definition for Mostly False.",False,image_105.jpg,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/AP25017670057232/3d62e339c79ca2f7b681c100231593fe.jpg,Related,0.2669855952262878,"The image shows a mostly dry lakebed, cracked earth, and a small amount of remaining water in the distance.  The claim, ""Some of these (California) reservoirs have been dry for 15, 20 years,"" refers to the prolonged drought conditions in California's reservoirs.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.27 suggests a weak but detectable relationship between the image and the claim.  This relatively low score reflects the lack of direct evidence in the image to definitively support the claim. The image depicts a dry lakebed, which *could* be a reservoir that has been dry for an extended period, aligning with the claim. However, the image doesn't provide any information about the specific location, the duration of the dryness, or whether it's a reservoir at all.  It's simply a visual representation of drought conditions.

The reasons for the weak relationship and low similarity score are:

* **Lack of specificity:** The image doesn't identify the location as a California reservoir. It could be a dry lake, a dried-up riverbed, or a reservoir in another state experiencing drought.
* **No temporal information:** The image doesn't indicate how long the lakebed has been dry.  The visual clues suggest a prolonged dry period, but not necessarily 15-20 years.
* **Visual ambiguity:**  While the cracked earth strongly suggests drought, it doesn't confirm the claim's specific timeframe.  Other factors besides prolonged drought could cause a lakebed to dry up.

In summary, the CLIP model likely classified the image as ""Related"" because the visual content (cracked earth, dry lakebed) is consistent with the general concept of prolonged drought and dry reservoirs mentioned in the claim. However, the lack of precise information in the image prevents a stronger correlation and results in the low similarity score.  The image provides supporting context but doesn't offer direct verification of the claim.

But it is untrue. Ellis, a Black Hawk pilot and member of the Virginia Army National Guard, posted a video Jan. 31 on Facebook as proof that she is alive.
""Some craziness has happened on the internet and I’m being named as one of the pilots of the DC crash. Please report any accounts or posts you see,"" Ellis posted Jan. 31 on Facebook. ""It’s insulting to the victims and families of those lost and they deserve better than this BS from the bots and trolls of the internet.""
She posted a video in which she said, ""I understand some people have associated me with the crash in D.C. and that is false… I hope that you all know that I’m alive and well, and this should be sufficient for you all to end all the rumors.""

The article described the accident as a ""murder suicide,"" for which there is no evidence. It said podcaster Luke Ford identified Ellis as the Black Hawk helicopter pilot. ""We are reporting a rumor,"" the article read. It mentioned that Ellis ""had been vocal against Trump the day before (in) an interview.""
The Santa Monica Observer later updated the article, saying Ellis ""is alive and was not involved in the incident at Reagan National Airport.""

While the exact text is difficult to read fully due to resolution and potentially compression artifacts,  the visible elements strongly suggest a connection to the claim, resulting in CLIP's ""Related"" classification, albeit with a relatively low similarity score (0.37).

Here's a breakdown of why the classification might have been made:

* **Helicopter Crash:** The dominant visual element is a photograph or illustration clearly depicting a helicopter crash scene, involving what seems to be a significant amount of debris and possible wreckage.  This directly relates to the core subject of the claim – a Blackhawk helicopter crash.  The visual representation of the event itself is a strong contributing factor to the ""Related"" classification.

* **News Context:** The image is presented within what appears to be a news article or news report framing.  The style and layout strongly suggest a journalistic context, aligning with the claim's presentation as a factual statement.  CLIP likely picks up on these visual cues (font styles, layout structure) associated with news articles.

* **Partial Text Visibility:** While illegible in its entirety, some parts of the text might be partially recognizable to CLIP.  Even fragments of words like ""helicopter,"" ""crash,"" or potentially names (though unlikely to be ""Jo Ellis"" given resolution) would increase the relevance score, even if not perfectly aligned with the exact wording of the claim.  CLIP doesn't ""read"" text in the way a human does; it identifies visual patterns associated with specific words and concepts.

* **Low Similarity Score (0.37):** The low similarity score reflects the limitations.  The image lacks explicit mention of ""Blackhawk,"" ""transgender,"" ""Reagan National,"" or ""Jo Ellis.""  The visual representation is generic to helicopter crashes.  The score indicates a loose connection rather than a strong, direct match.  The missing elements are crucial for a higher similarity score.  The image is generally suggestive, but lacks the specific details that are critical to the claim.

In conclusion, CLIP likely classified the image as ""Related"" due to the visual association of a helicopter crash with the central theme of the claim.  The journalistic context of the image further reinforces this link. However, the absence of specific details mentioned in the claim (aircraft model, location, pilot's name and gender identity) results in a relatively low similarity score reflecting the weaker, indirect relationship.  The image provides contextual support, but is not a direct visual confirmation of the claim's specifics.

The video began with a woman discussing Kenya’s digital ID program. The woman erroneously claimed birth certificates in Kenya will be replaced by digital IDs, which are ""somehow implanted, somewhere on somebody’s body.""

Next, the video showed a clip of Kenya President William Ruto discussing the country’s digital ID program and then showed a clip of Gates saying, ""We’re taking things that are genetically modified organisms and we’re injecting them in little kids arms, we just shoot them right into the vein."" 
The Gates video, however, is from 2015, and he was not talking about Kenya’s digital ID program. He was discussing medical research on vaccines and genetically modified organisms in Africa. 
Although Kenya’s digital ID program, Maisha Namba, is real, it does not involve physically implanting IDs into babies at birth. 
Kenya has struggled to create a digital ID program, the Center for Financial Inclusion, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, reported in August. Under the current program, the Kenyan government assigns Kenyan citizens nine-digit digital ID numbers, physical ID cards and digital IDs, using biometrics such as fingerprints. The IDs aim to let Kenyans access online government services more easily and better track payments for government services. 
Adult Kenyans can register for the program and newborn babies are issued nine-digit ID numbers at birth. None of the public reporting about the program says it involves implanting babies with physical devices.

Gates’ quote was taken from a 2015 interview with Euractiv, a Brussels news site focused on European policies, about the charitable work he and his then-wife, Melinda Gates, were conducting through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. 
The interviewer asked about the safety of genetically modified organisms in African agriculture. Gates compared genetically modified organism safety with research on vaccine safety. He said genetically modified organisms should not be banned outright. But he also said there should be trials and safety measures to ensure the organisms are safe, as there are for vaccines and medicines.
""The strongest analogy is to medicines, and, is there something to worry about with medicines, that is, might some of them have side effects?"" Gates said. ""Do we need safety testing? And we’re taking things that are genetically modified organisms and we’re injecting them in little kids arms, we just shoot them right into the vein. So, yeah, I think maybe we should have a safety system where we do trials and test things out.""
Although the interview was unrelated to Kenya’s digital ID program, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2023 advised Kenya on its digital ID rollout, Business Daily Africa reported. The foundation supports creating digital public infrastructure in low-income countries, which includes digital IDs, digital payment systems and data exchange systems.

The context provided indicates this photo is related to the claim that ""Bill Gates will be implanting digital IDs in newborns in Kenya.""  A similarity score of 0.30 from CLIP suggests a weak, but non-negligible, relationship. Let's analyze why CLIP might have made this classification:

The relatively low similarity score indicates that the connection isn't strong. The image doesn't directly depict the act of implanting digital IDs. However, CLIP's classification likely stems from several factors:

* **Bill Gates' presence:** The image prominently features Bill Gates.  The claim directly mentions him.  CLIP likely recognizes his face and connects it to the claim's subject.  This forms the primary basis for the relationship.

* **The Kenyan setting:** The context provided indicates the location is Kenya. This aligns with the claim's geographical context.  The visual cues in the image, while not definitive (requiring knowledge of the location), likely contribute to the association, albeit weakly.  The clothing and background could subtly suggest a Kenyan setting to the model.

* **Association with philanthropy:**  Bill Gates is strongly associated with philanthropic work, particularly through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.  This foundation often engages in health initiatives in developing countries.  CLIP might implicitly connect this general association (philanthropy in Africa) to the misleading claim of mandatory ID implantation, establishing a tenuous link. The act of shaking hands, often associated with collaborative efforts, could reinforce this perception.

* **Lack of contradictory information:** The image doesn't actively contradict the claim. It doesn't depict anything explicitly refuting the false claim.  The absence of counterevidence might contribute to a weak positive association.

However, the low similarity score (0.30) reflects the image's lack of direct visual evidence supporting the claim.  The image simply shows a handshake – a common interaction that carries no inherent implication of forced digital ID implantation.  The connection made by CLIP is primarily based on the presence of Bill Gates in a Kenyan context, relying on implicit and potentially spurious associations rather than direct visual proof.  A higher score would require the image to show some element related to digital IDs, newborns, or the act of implantation itself, none of which are present.

There are no credible news stories that support the account’s claims. We contacted senators in Republican leadership for comment but received no replies by deadline. 
Trump on Jan. 20, his first day back in office, pardoned or commuted the sentences of more than 1,500 people convicted of crimes over the Capitol attack. Although some Republicans have criticized the sweeping clemency, we found no examples of Senate Republicans endorsing a Trump impeachment. 
Some Republicans bristled at the choice to pardon people who violently assaulted police officers. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said people who assaulted officers ""should do the time,"" Politico reported. 
Politico reported that Sens. Thom Thillis, R-N.C., Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, also expressed disappointment in Trump’s decision. Cassidy, Murkowski and Collins were among seven Republicans who voted in 2021 to convict Trump over his role in the Capitol uprising.
Newsweek reported on one organization’s push for another Trump impeachment, but we see no signs Republicans will support that.
The Democratic-led House impeached Trump twice during his first term: first after he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to investigate Joe Biden and his son, and again on a charge of inciting an insurrection at the Capitol. The Senate acquitted him both times. 
Other social media posts in the days since Trump’s inauguration have made unsubstantiated claims of a growing impeachment movement. X posts claiming that Reps. Alexandria Ocaso-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Jamie Raskin, D-Md., filed articles of impeachment against Trump emerged Jan. 24. But the pair did no such thing. 
We found no examples of federal officeholders from either party saying Trump’s pardons were grounds for impeachment. With Republicans controlling the House, it’s almost certain an impeachment effort would fail in the chamber.
Twenty Republican senators would need to side with all Democrats to convict Trump on impeachment charges. All but six of the 43 senators who voted against convicting Trump in 2021 are still in office, and three of the seven Republicans who voted to convict him are in office. If history is any indication, there is no support in the conference to convict Trump.

Account has history of misleading posts
The X account that posted the claim, Politics Video, and its associated website, have a history of making false, misleading and unsubstantiated claims that are critical of Trump and Republicans.
The account speculated at least eight times in January that the majority-Republican Congress might impeach Trump. The posts similarly used purported anonymous sources that aren’t found in any credible reporting. 
In December, the account claimed that then-Vice President Kamala Harris is ""legally allowed to reject the certification of Trump’s election because of January 6."" That’s not true; the vice president’s role in certifying an election is purely ministerial.
The X account was created in February 2016, and its first public post is from December 2017.

The similarity score of 0.28, while not high, suggests a weak but discernible relationship between the image and the claim.  Let's break down why CLIP might have classified it as ""Related"":

* **Textual Alignment:** The most significant factor contributing to the ""Related"" classification is the presence of text in the image directly referencing the Senate and Trump's potential removal.  While the exact wording doesn't perfectly match the claim, the core concept – the Senate's role in a potential Trump removal following House impeachment – is clearly present.  CLIP likely recognized key words and phrases related to the claim's subject matter, such as ""Senate,"" ""Trump,"" and implied concepts of impeachment and removal.

* **Contextual Understanding:** CLIP, while not fully understanding the nuances of political processes, probably connected the visual context (a news screen displaying a political story) with the semantic meaning of the claim. The image's subject matter is directly relevant to the claim's topic, even if it doesn't definitively confirm or deny the claim's truthfulness.

* **Low Similarity Score Explanation:** The relatively low similarity score (0.28) indicates that the match is not strong. This is likely due to several factors:

    * **Absence of explicit confirmation:** The image doesn't explicitly state ""The U.S. Senate *has* the votes...""  It presents news about the Senate's potential role, leaving the question of sufficient votes open.
    * **Visual Ambiguity:** The image is primarily textual; there are no visual cues beyond the headline that strongly reinforce the claim.  CLIP relies heavily on visual features, and the lack of compelling visuals weakens the correlation.
    * **News Headline Nature:** News headlines often present information concisely, implying rather than explicitly stating facts. This implicit nature makes it more difficult for CLIP to establish a strong connection with a precise claim.


In summary, CLIP likely associated the image with the claim due to the presence of relevant keywords and the contextual understanding of the image as a news report concerning a topic directly related to the claim. However, the low similarity score reflects the lack of explicit confirmation and the limited visual information within the image that directly supports the claim's assertion about the Senate possessing sufficient votes. The relationship is more about thematic relevance than precise factual agreement.

The camera returned to Yost, who was standing in front of a green home in Altadena that looked like the one seen in the Instagram video and was purportedly looted. He interviewed a woman who said she lived there with her three children.
At one point, the camera panned to the woman’s house, showing a street address of 161. That’s the same house address that showed on the front of the house in the Instagram post that said it showed looting. In the original TV report, a young man wearing a blue hooded sweatshirt and light-colored pants walked out of the house — attire that matched that worn by the person carrying the white bag at the introduction of the Instagram video that claimed it showed looting. ""That’s my son,"" the woman told Yost.

One man wearing a red sweatshirt and pants, a wool cap and a face mask appears to be the same man seen carrying a TV out of the house in the posts that claimed to show looters.
The KTLA video did not show the men carrying the items out of the home. We contacted KTLA and Yost for comment but an editor there said the team was too busy covering the fires to immediately comment.
Looting has been a real problem during the Los Angeles wildfires. California Attorney General Rob Bonta vowed to hold looters accountable, and Gov. Gavin Newsom deployed the state’s National Guard to aid law enforcement. Officials have arrested multiple people for looting in wildfire-damaged areas, including one man dressed as a firefighter, news reports said.

The classification of ""Related"" with a similarity score of 0.31 to the claim ""Video shows people in Los Angeles looting from homes during wildfires"" is low, reflecting the image's lack of direct evidence supporting the claim.  The relationship is tenuous and based on contextual association rather than direct depiction.

Here's a breakdown of why the score is low and why the classifier might still deem it ""Related"":

* **Lack of People Looting:** The image shows burned-out houses and debris, typical of a wildfire aftermath. Crucially, there are *no* people visible in the image, let alone people engaged in looting.  This is the primary reason for the low similarity score.  The claim speaks specifically about *people looting*, and this is absent from the photograph.

* **Contextual Association:** The classifier likely connects the image to the claim based on the shared context of wildfires in the Los Angeles area.  The image depicts the aftermath of a wildfire, a key element in the claim.  The classifier might infer that given the devastation shown, the conditions might be conducive to looting, even if it doesn't show any actual looting taking place.  This is a weak connection.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The 0.31 score further emphasizes the weak relationship.  This is not a high degree of similarity; it suggests only a loose thematic connection.  A higher score would be expected if the image actually showed people engaging in looting.

* **Absence of Supporting Evidence:** The image lacks any text, symbols, or other visual cues that directly support the claim of looting.  There are no signs of forced entry or stolen property visible.

In summary, the CLIP model's classification is driven by a contextual association between wildfires in the Los Angeles area (as described in the claim) and the image showing wildfire damage in a nearby location.  However, the lack of visual evidence of looting itself results in a low similarity score, correctly indicating that the image does not provide direct support for the claim. The relationship is based on indirect circumstantial evidence, not direct depiction.

In late August 2021, conservative websites, pundits and politicians, such as U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, claimed that the Taliban had hanged someone from a helicopter flying over Afghanistan. The viral rumor was based on a short, blurry video that showed a helicopter flying with a person dangling from a rope beneath it.

The image shows a protest scene, likely related to the January 6th Capitol riot, but crucially **does not depict a banner photo of Joe Biden being hung from a helicopter.**

Here's a breakdown of why the low similarity score is accurate:

* **Absence of Joe Biden:** The image contains no recognizable depiction of Joe Biden. There are individuals in the crowd, but none resemble him.

* **Absence of a Banner:**  While there are signs and banners visible in the image, none of them portray Joe Biden in the described context.  The banners show various messages and symbols related to the protest, but none feature Biden being hung from a helicopter.

* **Absence of a Helicopter:**  The image does not show a helicopter at all.  The claim specifically mentions a helicopter as a key element of the alleged banner photo.

* **General Scene vs. Specific Claim:** The image depicts a chaotic and busy protest scene.  The claim, however, is very specific – a *banner photo of Joe Biden being hung from a helicopter*.  The image's general nature is vastly different from the specificity of the claim.  CLIP excels at identifying visual similarities to text descriptions, and the lack of any of the specific elements mentioned in the claim results in a low similarity score.

* **Contextual Understanding:**  While a human might recognize the image as relating to the political climate surrounding Donald Trump Jr. and Joe Biden, and thus infer a loose connection, CLIP does not possess this contextual knowledge.  It relies solely on direct visual comparisons between the image and the textual description, and finds no direct match.  The low similarity score reflects the absence of any of the key visual elements described in the claim.

In summary, the low similarity score (0.20) accurately reflects the lack of visual overlap between the image and the claim.  The image shows a general protest scene, while the claim describes a highly specific and absent image.  CLIP's assessment is based purely on visual elements and not on broader political context.

Several local authorities have denied the claims of a serial killer on the loose
There are no crime reports of a serial killer named Robert Thibodeau at large in the U.S.
Local authorities in southwest Florida have also said there is no serial killer loose in Collier County.
Local NBC affiliate WBBH-TV reported,  ""The Collier County Sheriff's Office said this is a scam that is appearing across the nation and is designed to victimize people and separate them from their money or personal information.""
Texas’ Eastland Police Department has also said the posts circulating in their communities are false.The San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department in California posted Dec. 5 on Facebook warning that the posts are a national scam. Local authorities in Wyoming and Tennessee have warned about the posts, too. 
We searched online and found that a man named Robert Thibodeau was indicted in March in Plattsburgh, New York, on weapons and ammunition charges after police found a loaded gun in his vehicle, according to local news NBC channel WPTZ-TV, which added that Thibodeau’s brother called police with concerns that Thibodeau may try to harm people at a hospital. But Thibodeau’s case is unrelated to the Facebook serial killer claims, and he isn’t the man in the posts’ photos.

Who’s the man in the posts?
  PolitiFact conducted a reverse-image search on the man’s photo in the posts and found that the mug shot was published August 2018 by the The Advocate in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

The image depicts a seemingly ordinary, slightly blurry, daytime photograph of a residential street scene.

Here's a breakdown of why the image is unrelated to the claim:

* **Lack of any relevant elements:** The image shows a street, houses, trees, and possibly some cars—none of which are suggestive of a crime scene, police activity, or anything related to a serial killer investigation. There are no visible signs of violence, disturbances, or anything out of the ordinary.

* **Absence of textual clues:** There's no visible text in the image that mentions a serial killer, a warning, or any relevant information.  Even subtle clues like news headlines or police tape are absent.

* **Generic nature of the scene:** The scene is incredibly generic and could be from almost any residential area.  This lack of specificity makes it impossible to link it to a particular city or an ongoing investigation.

* **Low visual complexity:** The image lacks the visual cues typically associated with crime news, such as emergency vehicles, police officers, crime scene tape, or distraught individuals.

* **CLIP's focus on visual semantics:** CLIP excels at matching textual descriptions with corresponding visual features.  Since the image contains no visual features related to the claim's theme of a serial killer on the run (e.g., crime scene, police presence, distressed citizens), the similarity score remains extremely low.

In summary, the image is a completely innocuous depiction of a residential street. It lacks any visual or textual elements that would connect it to the claim about a serial killer.  The low similarity score accurately reflects the absence of any relevant connection between the image and the text.  The CLIP model's classification is therefore accurate and well-justified.

If the story of Santiago Flight 513 sounds too outlandish to be believed, that’s probably because the tale is fictional. 
A flight’s reappearance after 35 years would be newsworthy — as would a plane arriving at its destination carrying human remains rather than passengers. However, when we searched using Google, Newspapers.com and the Nexis news archive, we found no credible reports or information supporting claims that ""Santiago Flight 513"" had landed in Brazil in 1989 after 35 years. We also found no evidence or credible reports that a plane landed carrying 92 skeletons on board.

The image shows a fairly typical scene of a modern airport terminal:  passengers moving through the terminal, luggage carts, and various airport signage. There is nothing in the image that visually connects to the fantastical claim of a flight landing 35 years late with skeletal remains on board.

Here's a breakdown of why the low similarity score is appropriate:

* **Absence of Aircraft:** The image contains no aircraft, either on the tarmac or depicted in any way.  A central element of the claim is the arrival of a specific flight; the lack of any aircraft is a major disconnect.

* **Lack of Skeletal Remains or Evidence of a Disaster:**  The claim involves a gruesome discovery of 92 skeletons.  The image shows a mundane, everyday scene at an airport, devoid of any sign of death, disaster, or unusual activity.

* **Modern Setting:** The airport depicted appears to be modern and well-maintained.  The claim suggests a flight that was missing for 35 years, implying potential age and decay associated with a long-lost aircraft.  The image contrasts sharply with this implied state.

* **No Textual Clues:** The image lacks any text related to Santiago Flight 513, the year 1989 (implied by the 35-year time frame from a hypothetical 1954 disappearance), or anything that hints at a missing plane or unusual event.

* **Everyday Scene:**  The overall impression created by the image is one of normality and routine airport activity. This stands in stark contrast to the extraordinary and macabre nature of the claim.

In essence, the CLIP model correctly identifies the complete semantic disconnect between a standard airport scene (the image) and a fantastical story involving a long-lost plane with skeletal remains (the claim). The low similarity score reflects the lack of any visual or contextual overlap between the two.  The model is functioning as intended by accurately assessing the lack of visual relationship between the image and the given text.

""To all the Milwaukee Brewers fans who live in Wisconsin: The Chicago Cubs owner is bankrolling Brad Schimel,"" the post reads. ""Vote accordingly."" 
We periodically look at claims related to politics that are circulating on social media. So, is the owner of the Cubs really bankrolling Schimel’s campaign? 
Let’s take a look. 
Big donors give money to state parties, which transfer to candidates 
We’ll get the baseball trivia out of the way first. The Ricketts family, headed by billionaire businessman Joe Ricketts, owns the Cubs. Joe’s son Tom is the team’s chairman. 
A look at Schimel’s publicly available campaign finance reports does not show the Ricketts in his list of donors. 
So what gives? The explanation requires some knowledge of campaign finance law in Wisconsin over the past decade. 
The state’s campaign finance laws cap the amount that a person can give to a Supreme Court candidate to $20,000. But under a change the Republican-controlled Wisconsin Legislature made in 2015, political parties can receive unlimited donations, which they can funnel to their preferred candidates. (That change has ultimately benefited Democrats more because they have been able to raise more money.) 
A review of the Republican Party of Wisconsin’s campaign finance reports shows a Jan. 27, 2025 donation from Joe Ricketts of $500,000. After receiving this and other large donations from wealthy individuals, Republican party officials transferred nearly $1.7 million in three donations to Schimel’s campaign. 
It’s illegal for a donor to give to the party and say they expect it to flow to a certain candidate, meaning it’s impossible to definitively prove that Ricketts’ money was for Schimel. 
Still, this practice has become a tried-and-true way for donors to get around individual contribution limits — so much so that Schimel encouraged people to do it.  
At a Calumet County Republican Party event last July, Schimel urged those who could afford to give more than $20,000 to give to the state party instead, the Journal Sentinel previously reported, suggesting any money given after the Nov. 5, 2024 election would be transferred to him.
""If you want to give a lot more, you can give that to either of the state parties, and they can transfer it,"" he said. ""They can transfer that to candidates.""

CBS News and “60 Minutes” “replaced” former Vice President Kamala Harris’ interview answers “with completely different, and far better, answers, taken from another part of the interview.”
By Sara Swann • February 7, 2025
(The Wisconsin Democracy Campaign filed an ethics complaint in early February over this remark and others by Schimel, who is prohibited by law from personally soliciting campaign donations.)
The state Democratic Party has also made use of this playbook. In January, they received $1 million from billionaire George Soros; $500,000 from Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker; $490,000 from Milwaukee philanthropist Lynde Uihlein; $470,000 from retired software engineer Gloria Page, the mother of Google co-founder Larry Page; and $250,000 from LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. Weeks after receiving those donations, they transferred $2 million in three donations to Crawford’s campaign. 
Now, for the nitty-gritty: the X post claims Ricketts is ""bankrolling"" Schimel. The dictionary definition of bankroll is ""to supply money for,"" but it’s worth noting that Ricketts is not supplying the majority of the funds in this extraordinarily expensive race. 
ABC Supply owner Diane Hendricks gave $970,000 to the state Republican party in January, and Uline president Liz Uihlein gave $650,000. Even groups backed by Elon Musk have dropped a few million on TV ads and increasing voter turnout for Schimel. 
All told, spending on this election is expected to outpace spending on Wisconsin’s last Supreme Court election in 2023, which totaled more than $56 million and shattered national spending records. 
Our ruling 
A post on social media claimed Chicago Cubs owner Joe Ricketts is bankrolling Schimel. 
A review of campaign finance records shows Ricketts gave a large sum to the state GOP, which has alongside Democrats transferred money to preferred candidates in a well-known workaround of individual contribution limits — something Schimel has acknowledged outright. 
Thus, the claim is largely accurate, though it’s missing the context of that workaround, which means we can’t know with complete certainty that Ricketts intended the money for Schimel. 
Our definition of Mostly True is a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. 
That fits here.",True,image_17.jpg,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/Chicago_Cubs_logo.svg/4e57730d79b0d9dfb38af234e963044a.jpg,Related,0.2920099794864654,"The image is simply the Chicago Cubs logo.  The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.29 to the claim ""The Chicago Cubs owner is bankrolling Brad Schimel"" is weak and likely based on a superficial association.  The score itself indicates a low degree of relevance.

Here's why the connection is tenuous:

* **Only Logo, No Context:** The image contains only the visual representation of the Chicago Cubs baseball team. There's no mention of the owner, any financial dealings, or Brad Schimel.  The image provides no factual evidence to support or refute the claim.

* **Weak Semantic Connection:** The connection relies entirely on the implicit link between the Cubs logo and its owner.  CLIP likely detects the logo and associates it with the Chicago Cubs organization and, by extension, its owner.  This is a very indirect association.  There's no direct link between the Cubs organization and Brad Schimel visibly present or logically implied from the image alone.  The model likely has some knowledge base associating the Cubs with their owner, allowing for a small degree of association.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The 0.29 similarity score is crucial.  It explicitly states that the relationship is weak.  This score suggests that CLIP finds little visual or semantic overlap between the image and the claim beyond the rudimentary association of the logo with the team and its ownership.

In summary, the classification is based on a very loose, indirect connection.  The image itself offers no direct evidence related to the claim, and the low similarity score highlights the weak nature of the association.  The relationship is purely based on the knowledge that the logo represents the team, and the team has an owner.  It's a case of association by implication, not by direct evidence.  More contextual information is needed to assess the truthfulness of the claim.

""Sounds very fishy,"" Musk wrote.
Contrary to Nawfal’s claim, Power’s assets did not ""skyrocket""; she already held assets averaging a total of $20 million before she became head of USAID.
In his post, Nawfal cited ""vBulletin"" and ""Inside Biden’s Basement"" as sources. The latter website, which says it tracks Biden administration alumni, estimated Power’s net worth between $10.1 million and $30.3 million. PolitiFact found no public evidence of the claim from the community forum software program vBulletin, which hosts private forums.
Power ran USAID for nearly four years under President Joe Biden, from May 2021 to January 2025. During the Obama administration, she served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations from 2013 to 2017, and held a senior staff position at the National Security Council from 2009 to 2013. Power was a Harvard Kennedy School professor and has written multiple books, including ""The Education of an Idealist,"" ""A Problem from Hell"" and ""Chasing the Flame."" 
After Biden nominated Power to be USAID administrator in January 2021, she filed a financial disclosure report as required.
PolitiFact analyzed her financial disclosures from January 2021, May 2022, May 2023 and May 2024. These disclosures generally don’t include assets or government income. They permit officials to report their assets and liabilities in range values, not fixed amounts, so it’s difficult to know their exact net worth. 
We took the minimum and maximum amounts of Power’s assets, her spouse’s assets, and ""other assets and incomes"" she reported, and added them together. Then, we subtracted Power’s reported liabilities to get her net worth. 
In 2021, Power’s assets and income sources included compensation and benefits from her teaching position at Harvard University, capital gains from venture capital firm the Social+Capital Partnership LLC, multiple book royalties and honoraria from speaking engagements. In ""other assets and income,"" Power listed cash values in 12 U.S. banks, several Vanguard holdings, and other stocks.

That year, Power’s spouse, Cass Sunstein, a Harvard Law School professor and former administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, recorded double the assets of Power.
All the assets listed in Power’s financial disclosure totaled $11 million to $30 million. Power listed one item — a mortgage — under liabilities, valued from $500,001 to $1 million, which would have made her net worth between $10 million and $29.5 million. It was the only liability Powers reported for four years. 
Her total combined assets did not fluctuate wildly during her term. In 2022, her average net worth was $20.9 million; in 2023, $18.2 million; and in 2024, $20.8 million.
Her personal assets decreased while she was in the federal agency role. She received fewer honoraria in 2022, 2023 and 2024, her disclosures show.

The score indicates a low degree of relevance.  Let's break down why:

The image shows Samantha Power in Kyiv, Ukraine, seemingly during an official visit.  Visible elements include:

* **Samantha Power:** The central focus is Power herself, easily identifiable.  This is the primary reason for the ""Related"" classification.  The claim is *about* her.
* **Setting:** The background clearly indicates an official visit to a foreign country (Ukraine).  This suggests her professional life, which is tangentially related to the wealth claim.  Her work as USAID administrator could indirectly relate to her financial standing, although the connection is weak.  The image doesn't offer any direct evidence of wealth.
* **No indicators of wealth:**  The image contains no visible luxury items, lavish surroundings, or anything else that would visually suggest a significant net worth.

**Why the low similarity score (0.34)?**

The low similarity score reflects the lack of direct connection between the image's content and the claim's essence.  The image shows Power in her professional capacity, while the claim focuses on her personal finances.  The image doesn't provide visual evidence supporting or refuting the claim.  The connection is merely contextual:  the image is *of* the person mentioned in the claim.

In summary, the ""Related"" classification is based solely on the presence of Samantha Power in the image.  The image doesn't visually represent or allude to her wealth or the alleged increase in her net worth.  The low similarity score reflects the weak and indirect nature of this connection.  A higher score would require the image to show something directly relevant to the claim, such as expensive properties, luxury goods, or even news headlines about her wealth.

The Facebook video was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Threads and Instagram.)
But this video is not entirely authentic. The video’s first scene showing skyscrapers burning and plumes of smoke in the sky is digitally created. It does not bear a resemblance to downtown Los Angeles’ skyline, which has been largely unaffected by the fires. The third scene shows another angle — we traced it to a Jan. 10 TikTok video made by an account with username ‘@digital.n0mad.’ The profile described the user as an ""unusual AI artist"" and its posts as ""Fake Video, AI Art.""
The post’s second scene opened with people running, with traffic in one direction and many red lights in the distance.

The final scene showing a residential complex burning is also an artificial intelligence-created video that has been circulating online for months.

But CBS News fact-checkers debunked it in October as generated by artificial intelligence and also traced it to the @digital.n0mad account.
Our ruling
A viral video claims to show the ongoing fires that have ravaged parts of Los Angeles. But only one out of the five scenes in the video are of the greater Los Angeles fires. The rest of the scenes can be traced back to a self-described AI-artist’s TikTok account and to soccer fans celebrating in Algeria.

The provided image shows a clear, relatively unobstructed daytime view of the Los Angeles skyline. There is no visible evidence of fire, smoke, or any other indicators of a fire event.

Here's a breakdown of why the low similarity score is appropriate:

* **Absence of Fire:** The most crucial factor is the complete lack of any visual evidence of fire.  No smoke plumes, burning structures, or flames are visible in the photograph. The cityscape appears normal and unmarred by fire damage.

* **Daytime Scene:** The image depicts a brightly lit daytime scene.  Wildfires, especially large ones, often generate significant smoke that obscures the skyline, particularly impacting visibility in daytime images.  The clear visibility in this image contradicts the claim of a fire.

* **Lack of Contextual Clues:** There are no contextual clues within the image suggesting a recent fire. No emergency vehicles, firefighting equipment, or any signs of evacuation or damage are present.

* **Focus on the Skyline:** The image's primary focus is on the architectural details of the Los Angeles skyline. This focus on a typical urban landscape further strengthens the ""Unrelated"" classification.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The low similarity score (0.24) reflects the significant difference between the expected visual content of an image depicting Los Angeles fires (smoke, flames, damage) and the actual content of the provided image (a clear view of the LA skyline).  This numerical score quantifies the lack of visual overlap between the image and the claim.

In summary, the CLIP model correctly identifies the disconnect between the claim of a video showing Los Angeles fires and the presented image, which depicts a normal, fire-free Los Angeles skyline.  The image provides no supporting evidence for the claim, resulting in the appropriate ""Unrelated"" classification and low similarity score.

It's clearly a fake or altered image designed to represent a hypothetical fight outcome. The low similarity score of 0.33 from CLIP indicates a weak relationship, which is accurate given the circumstances.

The claim, ""Stunning Knockout: Mike Tyson Defeats Jake Paul in Just 50 Seconds with a Devastating K.O.,"" directly depicts a specific and dramatic event – a quick knockout victory for Tyson.  The image, while showing Tyson and Paul in a boxing context, doesn't visually depict that specific event.  It's a static image, not a dynamic representation of a knockout.

Here's a breakdown of why the similarity score is low despite the thematic connection:

* **Lack of Action:** The image shows Tyson and Paul seemingly in a neutral pose, not in the midst of a fight or a knockout.  There's no visible impact, struggle, or the aftermath of a knockout.  The claim requires a dynamic visual representation of a swift and decisive victory, which is completely absent.

* **Digital Manipulation:** The obvious artificiality of the image lowers the similarity.  The image likely uses AI upscaling or other manipulation techniques which makes it less connected to a real-world event (the hypothetical boxing match). Real photos from a real fight would have significantly higher similarity.

* **Contextual Difference:** While both the claim and image concern a hypothetical Tyson-Paul fight, the claim specifies a particular result (a 50-second knockout) that isn't visually represented. The image only presents the two boxers together – a generic visual that could represent any point in a fight or even a pre-fight photo opportunity.

* **CLIP's Limitations:** CLIP is a multimodal model; its understanding is based on correlation, not causality or nuanced understanding of narrative.  While it recognizes the individual elements (Tyson, Paul, boxing ring), it struggles to connect the static image to the dynamic description in the claim.  The lack of visual evidence of the knockout significantly reduces the similarity score.

In essence, the image provides a very general context related to the claim, but lacks the specific visual details required to accurately depict the claimed event.  The 0.33 similarity score reflects this significant gap between the claim's descriptive narrative and the image's static, and somewhat artificial, representation.

Here's a breakdown of why the low similarity score is appropriate:

* **Absence of USAID branding or symbols:** The image lacks any logos, symbols, or textual references related to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).  The claim directly involves USAID's financial actions, and the absence of any visual representation of that agency is crucial.

* **Lack of financial documentation:**  The image provides no evidence of any financial transactions, contracts, or salary details.  To visually corroborate the claim, the image would need to show documents or other visual evidence directly linking USAID funds to Reid's salary or the salaries of other news anchors.

* **Focus on a single individual:** The image shows only Joy Reid.  While she is a relevant figure due to her employment with MSNBC, the claim refers to potentially multiple hosts across two different news networks (CNN and MSNBC).  The image's narrow focus limits its relevance to the broad claim.

* **Contextual irrelevance:** The image is simply a portrait of a news anchor.  It doesn't depict any activity, event, or setting that directly relates to the claim of USAID subsidizing salaries. The background is generic and uninformative.


In summary, the image is a simple headshot of a news personality.  It provides no information whatsoever about USAID's financial activities or involvement in the salaries of news anchors.  Therefore, the CLIP model's ""Unrelated"" classification and low similarity score are accurate reflections of the image's complete lack of relevance to the stated claim.  The image is merely a picture of Joy Reid; it offers no evidence supporting or refuting the claim about USAID funding.

This claim is inaccurate. More than eight charging stations have been built and several hundred are still under construction by state and local governments.
Rulli’s office did not respond to our request for comment.
The $7.5 billion figure refers to funding for expanded electric vehicle charging from the 2021 bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The law gave $5 billion for EV charging under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program and $2.5 billion under the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure grant program. The federal government distributes National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure funds to transportation departments in all 50 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia; a wide range of agencies, including municipal governments, tribal governments and universities, can access Charging and Fueling Infrastructure funds. 
A U.S. Federal Highway Administration spokesperson told PolitiFact the two federal programs have so far funded 37 charging stations. Like gas stations, EV charging stations can have multiple charging points.
Of the 37 federally funded stations built in 13 states, there are 226 charging ports, said Rachael Dussuau, the Federal Highway Administration’s associate public affairs administrator. As of Dec. 3, Dussuau said there are projects underway for 24,800 federally funded charging ports.

She told PolitiFact in an email that the recent Facebook claim is ""not true"" and that states have not spent all of the $7.5 billion from the infrastructure law.
To get money from the 2021 law, states and agencies must submit plans to an office run jointly by the Energy and Transportation departments. The Federal Highway Administration approves the plans; state and local jurisdictions oversee construction.
The federally funded EV charging program started slowly. Although the infrastructure law passed in November 2021, the Energy Department said initial state plans were not approved until September 2022. Constructing an EV charging station also requires site selection, permitting, collaborating with utility companies and other aspects of construction.
The Facebook claim likely comes from a March Washington Post report that found the program’s slow rollout meant only seven charging stations had been completed. During his speech at the Republican National Convention, President-elect Donald Trump falsely claimed the Biden administration spent $9 billion on eight chargers.Buttigieg responded to Trump Jr.’s post on X, saying, ""In this program, the chargers are built by the states, not the federal government. And while it takes time to get a novel multi-billion dollar program going across 50 states, the states are on track.""

The tweet highlights a perceived inefficiency in spending $7.5 billion on only 8 stations.

The claim, “Pete Buttigieg will leave his post as Transportation Secretary having spent $7.5 billion to build 8 EV charging stations,” is directly echoed in the text of the tweet.  This is the primary reason why CLIP classified the image as ""Related"" with a similarity score of 0.28.

While the similarity score is relatively low (indicating a weak relationship), this is understandable given the limitations of CLIP.  The model likely focuses on the textual overlap between the claim and the tweet.  It doesn't inherently understand the context or the validity of the underlying claim (which is factually incorrect; the $7.5 billion figure likely refers to a much larger program than just 8 stations).  The image itself doesn't visually depict EV charging stations or Pete Buttigieg.  The relationship is solely based on the textual content of the tweet which directly repeats a key part of the claim, focusing on the high cost and low number of charging stations.

In short, the ""Related"" classification stems from the semantic overlap between the numerical data and the subject of the claim and the content of the tweet.  The low similarity score reflects the lack of visual connection and the inherent ambiguity in interpreting the numerical claim.  The model is simply identifying keyword matches, not judging the truth or broader implications of the statement.

While the image doesn't explicitly state ""Nevada ballots don’t even have to be postmarked to be counted after the election,"" it provides information relevant to the claim's accuracy, thus explaining the CLIP model's ""Related"" classification, albeit with a low similarity score (0.25).

The low similarity score reflects the fact that the image doesn't directly and explicitly support or refute the claim. The connection is indirect and requires interpretation.  The image only presents a piece of the legal framework, not a definitive answer.

Here's a breakdown of why the image is considered related:

* **Focus on Absentee Ballot Receipt:** The image centers on a portion of Nevada's election law concerning absentee ballots.  The claim focuses on the counting of ballots *after* the election, implying absentee ballots.  This overlap in subject matter creates a link.

* **No Postmark Requirement (implied):** While the image doesn't explicitly say ""no postmark required,"" it deals with the criteria for counting absentee ballots.  A careful reading of the full code section (which is partially visible) would be needed to determine whether a postmark is a condition for counting.  The absence of a clear statement about postmarks in *this specific excerpt* contributes to the relevance, albeit weakly.  The absence of information doesn't disprove the claim, but neither does it directly support it.

* **Contextual Relevance:** The image’s source, Politifact, suggests that the image is being used in the context of fact-checking claims about Nevada's election procedures.  This contextual information heavily influences the relevance assigned by CLIP.  The model likely recognizes the Politifact logo and infers the image's purpose within the context of election verification.

In summary, the CLIP model likely classified the image as ""Related"" because of the thematic connection between the image's content (Nevada election law regarding absentee ballots) and the claim (concerning the postmarking and counting of Nevada ballots). The low similarity score accurately reflects the weak, indirect nature of this relationship.  The image provides relevant context but does not directly confirm or deny the claim; further investigation of the full legal code is required to assess the claim's veracity.

He's clearly identifiable, dressed in his characteristic attire.  There's no text in the image directly stating he's leaving the Democratic Party.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a low similarity score (0.31) is likely due to the image's association with Senator Fetterman himself.  The claim focuses on a significant political action (switching parties), while the image only shows Fetterman's presence.  The low similarity score reflects the weak connection.

Here's a breakdown of why the relationship is weak but still classified as ""related"":

* **Visual association:** The image is directly relevant to Senator Fetterman.  Any image containing him would have *some* level of relation to a claim about him.  CLIP identifies the subject as Fetterman, which is a fundamental part of the claim.

* **Lack of contextual information:** The image provides no information about a party switch.  It doesn't show him with members of another party, displaying a different party logo, or making any statement about his political affiliation.  The image is purely descriptive; it shows Fetterman, but doesn't support or contradict the claim.

* **Low similarity score:** The 0.31 score explicitly indicates a weak relationship.  This score suggests that while the image contains the relevant individual, it lacks the visual cues to directly support or refute the claim. A higher score would imply a stronger visual correlation, such as an image of Fetterman at a Republican event or signing a document indicating a party switch.

In summary, the relationship is based solely on the presence of Senator Fetterman in the image.  The image itself doesn't contribute to the truth or falsehood of the claim, hence the low similarity score despite the ""Related"" classification.  CLIP likely associates the image with the claim based on the subject matter (Fetterman) rather than the claim's content (party switch).

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.42, while not a strong correlation, suggests a connection between the image and the claim ""The Episcopal Archdiocese of Washington has removed Bishop Mariann Budde from the National Cathedral.""  The relatively low score indicates the connection is tenuous and indirect, requiring interpretation.

Here's why the connection might exist:

* **Visual Subject:** The primary element is Bishop Budde herself. The claim directly mentions her.  The presence of her image inherently links the image to the claim's subject.  This forms the basis for any perceived relationship.

* **Lack of Contextual Clues:** The image itself offers no information about removal from the National Cathedral. There's no visible text, background, or other elements that explicitly support or refute the claim. The photo is a generic portrait, offering little to confirm or deny the claim's specifics.

* **Implied Relationship:** The claim suggests a change in Bishop Budde's status within the Episcopal Archdiocese of Washington concerning the National Cathedral. The image, showing the bishop, merely represents the *subject* of this potential change.  The CLIP model likely establishes a connection based solely on the presence of the individual mentioned in the claim.

* **Similarity Score:** The low similarity score of 0.42 indicates the model isn't finding a strong visual match between the image content and the semantic meaning of the claim.  A higher score would imply a stronger connection, such as an image depicting a formal announcement or Bishop Budde leaving the National Cathedral.

In summary, the ""Related"" classification stems from the image containing the central figure (Bishop Budde) mentioned in the claim.  The low similarity score highlights the lack of direct visual evidence supporting the claim within the image itself. The relationship is inferred, not directly depicted.  The model identifies the shared element (Bishop Budde) but doesn't interpret the contextual implications of the claim regarding her removal.

""Philadelphia city commissioners’ office tells non-citizens they can vote if they are Philly residents,"" read a Nov. 4 X post from O’Keefe Media Group, the creation of founder and former Project Veritas leader James O’Keefe.
In the video, O’Keefe — who left Project Veritas in 2023 when its board accused him of spending donor funds on ""personal luxuries""  — said he was standing outside a Philadelphia city commissioners’ office, where people were early voting. Across the street, he said, was a gathering of people from Ceiba, a nonprofit promoting economic development in Latino communities.
""They are telling people to vote,"" O’Keefe said in the video, appearing to refer to people associated with Ceiba. ""They are telling people that all you need is what is called an (ITIN) number.""
He then showed footage that he said showed an undercover reporter getting confirmation from the nonprofit and a county commissioner’s office worker that ""she can vote with nothing but an ITIN number"" and ""you only need to be a resident of Philadelphia.""

""ITIN"" refers to an individual taxpayer identification number, a nine-digit number the Internal Revenue Service issues to people filing tax returns who are not U.S. citizens and who do not have or are not eligible for Social Security numbers.

The video gained traction on X, with several leading conservatives, including conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, amplifying it as an example of election misconduct.

""This is the smoking gun of attempted election theft,"" Jones wrote.

""BREAKING: PENNSYLVANIA ELECTION FRAUD!"" wrote another X user who shared the post.

But this video does not show proof of noncitizen voting in the federal election. O’Keefe founded Project Veritas, a right-wing organization known for doing undercover reporting and using selectively edited videos. This video used a similar format. (O’Keefe was sued in 2021 and, following a settlement earlier this year, apologized for falsely claiming a postal worker committed voter fraud.)
Federal law requires voters be U.S. citizens to vote in federal elections, and although a small number of municipalities nationwide permit noncitizen voting in local races, Philadelphia is not among them.
""This report is incorrect and not supported at all by the facts,"" Philadelphia City Commissioner Seth Bluestein, a Republican, wrote Nov. 4  on X, responding to the O’Keefe video. ""Non-citizens are not eligible to vote in Philadelphia. A mail ballot provided by our office can only be counted after the voter verifies their ID, typically with a social security number or driver’s license number.""
Spokesperson Kevin Feeley sent PolitiFact a statement from the Philadelphia City Commissioners that described the video as ""selectively edited"" and said it showed ""a staffer at one of our Satellite Elections offices explaining voter eligibility requirements.""
""Noncitizens may not legally register to vote or cast a ballot anywhere in Pennsylvania, including Philadelphia,"" the spokesperson’s statement said.
Ceiba also addressed the video, writing on Instagram that its organization was ""targeted by an organized group of individuals who recorded our staff, and falsely accused us of registering non-citizens to vote.""

In a second Instagram statement, Ceiba added that one of its staff members incorrectly answered a question about whether ITINs can be used to vote. It said that does not align with its training or practice.

""Additionally, there is a system of checks and balances — with both mail ballots and in person voting that prevent a person from being able to vote using an ITIN.""
Pennsylvania voters who are voting for the first time in their election districts must show proof of identification, and an ITIN is not a valid proof of identity.
""The ITIN, used to help noncitizens to pay their taxes, is a distinct number and it is impossible for someone to use it to register to vote,"" Ceiba’s Instagram statement said.
As O’Keefe claimed Ceiba told people they could use ITIN numbers to vote, he showed a portion of a Spanish-language flier to the camera.

* **Absence of Key Elements:** The claim centers on conversations about *noncitizen voting* outside a specific location, the Philadelphia city commissioners' office. The image contains none of these elements.  There's no mention of Philadelphia, no indication of non-citizens being involved, and no depiction of conversations or activity outside an office building.

* **Generic Nature of the Image:** The image is a fairly typical photograph of election workers performing their duties. It's a general representation of election-related activity, lacking any specific details that would connect it to the claim's specifics (location, subject matter, alleged fraudulent activity).  The setting appears to be a standard election processing location, not the exterior of a city commissioners' office.

* **Lack of Contextual Clues:**  The image provides no textual or visual clues to suggest any irregularities or fraudulent activities.  There are no people visibly engaging in suspicious behavior, no signs of irregularities in the ballot handling process, and no identifying markers linking it to Philadelphia or any specific alleged instance of voter fraud.

* **Visual Similarity Score:** The low similarity score (0.25) reflects the lack of shared visual features between the image and the concept of the claim. CLIP likely compares visual features (people, objects, locations, activities) between the image and its internal representation of the claim's concept.  Since there's virtually no overlap, the score is low.

In summary, the image depicts a generic election-day scene, completely unrelated to the specific allegations of noncitizen voting conversations outside the Philadelphia city commissioners' office.  The CLIP model correctly identifies this lack of connection, resulting in the ""Unrelated"" classification and low similarity score.

""Thank you for making it happen,"" Musk said. ""Thank you. My heart goes out to you. It is thanks to you that the future of civilization is assured.""

Others compared it with the ""Roman salute,"" also known as the ""fascist salute,"" which Italian fascists and later Nazi Germany adopted.

Crucially, there are no visible references to Elon Musk, the X platform (formerly Twitter), the MAGA movement, or any direct connection to the claimed statement.

The image's visual elements primarily depict:

* **Protesters:** A crowd of people participating in a protest.  Their attire and banners might suggest an anti-fascist or anti-Nazi stance (this is difficult to definitively say without clearer text on the banners).
* **Protest signs/banners:**  These are partially visible and blurred, preventing any specific textual analysis. However, their general presence suggests a political demonstration, not a discussion related to Elon Musk or the MAGA movement.
* **General protest atmosphere:** The image depicts a dynamic scene characteristic of a rally or protest; there's a sense of movement and collective action.  This is not indicative of a social media post or its aftermath.

The claim, on the other hand, focuses on a specific statement allegedly made by Elon Musk on the X platform, referring to a comparison between the MAGA movement and Nazi Germany. This is entirely separate from the context of the image. There's no visual representation of the X platform, any quotes from Musk, or any symbols representing the MAGA movement or Nazi Germany.

The low similarity score (0.25) reflects the complete lack of visual overlap between the image's content and the claim's subject matter.  The image is a depiction of a political protest, while the claim discusses a specific social media post and its controversial content. The two are independent and unrelated events.

When we called the tip line Jan. 31, a recorded message said that the tip line was ""currently experiencing a higher call volume than normal"" and asked callers to submit tips online instead. 
We found no evidence, such as credible news reports or public statements, that this was because of reports about Musk’s immigration status.
We rate claims ICE announced it was pausing its tip line because most of the calls were from people reporting Musk False.",False,image_60.jpg,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/Elon_Musk_town_hall_10-17-2024/7143ddd07f543ec3f79f5fe9ff5ae33d.jpg,Related,0.2714875936508178,"The CLIP model's classification of the image as ""Related"" to the claim about ICE pausing its hotline due to an overwhelming number of Elon Musk reports, with a similarity score of 0.27, is relatively low and indicates a weak connection.  The low score suggests that the relationship isn't visually strong.  Let's analyze why there's *some* connection, albeit a weak one:

The image (assuming it's the Politifact image linked) likely shows Elon Musk at a public appearance or event.  The connection to the claim rests solely on the presence of Elon Musk. The claim states that a large percentage of calls to the ICE hotline were about Elon Musk.  The image provides visual confirmation of Elon Musk's existence and public profile.  This is the only visual element linking the image to the claim.

The weakness of the connection stems from several factors:

* **Lack of Direct Evidence:** The image doesn't show anything related to ICE, immigration, or the hotline. It's simply a picture of Elon Musk.  There's no context suggesting he's involved in any way with the reported ICE hotline issue.
* **Low Similarity Score:** A score of 0.27 indicates a very weak visual relationship.  CLIP likely found only a very minimal overlap in the visual features between a picture of Elon Musk and the concept of an ICE hotline overwhelmed by reports about him.
* **Context is Crucial:** The claim itself is highly unusual and requires substantial evidence. The image, by itself, provides absolutely no evidence to support or refute this claim.  The connection relies entirely on the subject's presence in the image.
* **Absence of relevant keywords:**  The image likely lacks any text or visual cues related to ""ICE,"" ""immigration,"" ""hotline,"" or similar terms that would strengthen the association.


In summary, the relationship is established solely through the presence of Elon Musk in the image, which is tangentially related to the claim's subject.  The low similarity score accurately reflects the weak and indirect nature of this connection.  The image itself offers no substantive support for the claim's veracity.  The connection is purely based on the shared subject, and lacks any visual elements that would strengthen the correlation.

The Threads post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)
The post sought to tie the incoming Trump administration to Project 2025, a sweeping policy proposal the Heritage Foundation produced for a Republican administration. A video in the post played a clip of Rubio speaking at the conservative think tank.
But the post inaccurately describes what Rubio said in the clip, and ignores that Rubio was speaking to the group in 2015 — eight years before Project 2025 was published.

In the Threads video, Rubio said, ""Thank you to Heritage for inviting us here, giving us an opportunity, and for all the scholarship that they do here. That really serves as a guidepost for a lot of the public policy we choose to make.""
He did not mention Project 2025, nor did he in the full video of the April 15, 2015, event, at which Rubio joined fellow Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, to discuss tax reform. 
Rubio could not have mentioned Project 2025 in 2015 because the plan wasn’t published until April 2023. The video also shows a ""Road to the White House 2016"" logo. (Two days earlier, Rubio had announced his own presidential run, which he would later end in March 2016 after Trump beat him in the Florida Republican primary.) 
Vice President Kamala Harris and Democrats similarly tried to make Project 2025 a major campaign issue and tried to tie it to Trump.
Trump sought to distance himself from Project 2025 during the campaign, calling some parts of the plan ""ridiculous."" The New York Times reported that about 175 former Trump administration officials and advisers helped write the plan, and some of its policy proposals, such as eliminating the Education Department, mirror Trump’s.

Videos show that President Donald Trump admitted to rigging the 2024 election during his preinauguration day rally.
By Loreben Tuquero • January 21, 2025
Trump so far has named Tom Homan, formerly his acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement director, as his ""border czar."" Homan, a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation, is listed as one of dozens of Project 2025 contributors.
A CBS News analysis of Project 2025 found more than 700 specific policy proposals. Its review found that at least 270 matched Trump’s past policies or recent campaign promises.
Project 2025 calls for extensive overhauls in the executive branch and draws on long-held conservative principles, such as tax cuts that Trump has agreed with or may agree with. Trump, on his own, published a less specific agenda during his 2024 presidential campaign.
When asked about Project 2025 in a July CNN interview, Rubio said he likes the Heritage Foundation and some things it stands for. But he described Project 2025 as a think tank’s work, not as something speaking for Trump.
There may be some overlap between Project 2025 and the policies Trump will seek to enact, but the claim that this 2015 video shows Rubio ""admitting"" that Trump will lean heavily on the plan is False.

The relatively low similarity score of 0.30 from CLIP suggests a weak visual connection between the image and the claim ""Video shows Marco Rubio ‘admitting the Trump Presidency will lean heavily into the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 plans.’""  This low score is justifiable considering the following:

* **Lack of Explicit Textual Evidence:** The image itself contains no visible text referencing ""Heritage Foundation,"" ""Project 2025,"" or any explicit admission by Rubio about the Trump presidency leaning on those plans.  The claim relies on the *content* of the video, not anything visually apparent in the still image.

* **Generic Context:** The image only shows Rubio speaking.  His expression is neutral; there's nothing in his body language or the setting that directly supports or refutes the claim.  It's a standard shot of a politician giving a statement, which is visually unremarkable and doesn't offer any specific clues about the topic of his speech.

* **Inference Required:** To determine the validity of the claim, one must rely entirely on the *audio* component of the video, which is absent from the still image.  CLIP, being a visual model, cannot process audio.  Therefore, the 'Related' classification is based solely on the presence of Rubio, the subject of the claim.

* **Similarity Score as a Measure of Visual Similarity:** The similarity score of 0.30 indicates a weak visual relationship.  This reflects that the image alone doesn't provide much evidence related to the core elements of the claim (Heritage Foundation, Project 2025, admission).  A higher score would indicate a stronger visual correspondence, such as showing a document mentioning Project 2025 or Rubio explicitly gesturing towards relevant written material.


In summary, the CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a low similarity score accurately reflects the limited visual information provided by the still image. The image only shows Rubio speaking, offering no visual evidence to support or contradict the claim's core assertion.  The relationship is weak because the claim hinges on the *audio* content of the video, which the image cannot convey.  The classification is based on the presence of Rubio, the subject of the claim, but the lack of any other relevant visual elements results in the low similarity score.

"Susan Crawford
stated on February 9, 2025 in TV interview:",Wisconsin does not “require judges to automatically recuse just because they have done some kind of legal work in the past as a lawyer.”,"stated on February 9, 2025 in TV interview:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/feb/19/susan-crawford/candidate-right-that-wisconsin-does-not-require-ju/,,"As the race for control of Wisconsin’s Supreme Court picks up steam, there’s a word you’ve probably heard: Recusal. 
Recusal refers to a justice’s decision to sit out a case because they have a connection to the lawsuit or lawyers that affects their ability to rule fairly. 
Dane County Court Judge Susan Crawford, the liberal candidate in the race, was asked by WISN-TV’s ""Upfront"" during its Feb. 9, 2025 episode if she should recuse herself from any case before the Supreme Court involving abortion. 
Crawford, as a private attorney, represented Planned Parenthood in challenging a state law that required physicians providing abortion services to get admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.
""The law does not require judges to automatically recuse just because they have done some kind of legal work in the past as a lawyer,"" Crawford said.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
Crawford’s involvement in the case happened about a decade ago: A federal appeals court panel found the law unconstitutional in 2015. 
Because recusal is bound to come up in the remaining weeks of campaigning, let’s take a look at what the standards are in Wisconsin. Legal experts will also explain why there are often gray areas.
Code of conduct requires recusal if justice served as a lawyer in the specific lawsuit
Let’s start with laying out what the Code of Judicial Conduct says about recusal, and if it mentions anything about stepping away because of previous work as a lawyer.
Here are just a few of the situations where the code says a justice should recuse. 
The judge was a material witness in the case.
The judge, their spouse or minor children have an economic interest in the case.
The judge’s spouse or relative is a lawyer in the case. 
But there’s another one that relates to Crawford’s claim: ""The judge served as a lawyer in the matter in controversy.""
Wait — does ""matter in controversy"" mean Crawford would be disqualified from participating in anything related to abortion?
That’s not the case, explained Charles Geyh, a professor at the Indiana University Maurer School of Law who specializes in judicial ethics. The ""matter"" refers to a specific lawsuit, not a broad issue. 
""You can certainly see where if you expanded it to include the issue, that would get crazy pretty quickly. Lawyers who are active litigators may be addressing bazillions of issue areas,"" Geyh said. 
Howard Schweber, a professor emeritus of political science and legal studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, noted many judges previously worked as criminal prosecutors or defenders.
""It would be absurd to suggest that those judges must recuse themselves from any case involving a crime,"" Schweber said. 
Recusal decisions exist on a spectrum, can lead to some grey areas
But sometimes it’s not quite so straightforward. Schweber sees recusal decisions as a spectrum. 
At the most obvious end is recusing because you’d make money if you rule a certain way. At the other end is recusing because of a philosophical belief you have. 
If a justice worked for Planned Parenthood on the particular issue in a lawsuit now before the Supreme Court, recusal would be appropriate, Schweber said. But simply working for Planned Parenthood is less so. 
""It’s unfortunately really quite difficult to be much more specific than that, because there’s an element of judgment involved,"" Schweber said. 
Crawford’s campaign provided much of the same background when PolitiFact Wisconsin reached out, citing a report on recusal from the State Democracy Research Initiative at UW’s Law School.
""Notably, Judge Crawford’s representation of Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin was not the same action that is now before the court. Recusal is not required simply for having represented a party in previous actions,"" her campaign said.
For context, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin has asked the Supreme Court to recognize a constitutional right to bodily autonomy, including abortion.
Schweber said working on a particular issue like the constitutionality of Act 10 would be a stronger case for recusal. ""It’s further down that spectrum of possibilities,"" Schweber said.  
Another way to look at the spectrum: Conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn recused from the current Act 10 case because he helped create the law and defended it as former Gov. Scott Walker’s chief legal counsel.
Crawford also addressed Act 10 in the interview — she represented teachers challenging the law. Crawford said she’d consider the parties bringing the lawsuit and which part of Act 10 is being litigated.

“Melania wins $900 million ‘defamation lawsuit’ against The View & Sunny Hostin.”
By Sofia Ahmed • February 4, 2025
Justices themselves ultimately decide whether to recuse, some have called for stricter rules
That gets into a second major idea that supports Crawford’s claim.
In Wisconsin, Supreme Court justices decide for themselves if they’d be biased on a certain issue and if they should recuse. The other justices can’t overrule their decision.
So, it would be up to Crawford to make the final call about whether to step away from a case involving a group she represented or an issue she worked on in the past.
""If you work for Planned Parenthood, you can assume that you’re not hostile to the goals of Planned Parenthood,"" Geyh said.
""But even then, there is no rule that says once you stop doing that and you put on your judicial hat, that you are somehow compromised in your ability to be fair and impartial,"" he said.
Because justices rule on their own bias, some have called for stricter standards. Geyh is on board with that idea but cautioned that partisan interests could ""manufacture"" new rules to get a justice off a case.
Crawford and her conservative opponent, Waukesha County Court Judge Brad Schimel, were asked by WISN if they would back imposing recusal rules for the Supreme Court.
Schimel said he would want to see what the rules would be before deciding whether to support them. 
Crawford said she thinks the current judicial code is a ""workable system, but I also welcome any opportunities to strengthen and improve a system like that.""
Our ruling
Crawford said Wisconsin does not ""require judges to automatically recuse just because they have done some kind of legal work in the past as a lawyer.""
Legal experts interviewed by PolitiFact Wisconsin agreed — it would be a slippery slope if justices weren’t allowed to participate in cases that broadly relate to their past work. 
The judicial code requires recusal if the justice worked as a lawyer in the ""matter in controversy."" That refers to a particular lawsuit, not a broad issue like abortion. But there can be gray areas.
Ultimately, it’s up to Crawford to determine whether she’d be impartial in a case, the same as any other justice on the bench.

The claim, ""Wisconsin does not ‘require judges to automatically recuse just because they have done some kind of legal work in the past as a lawyer,’"" is about judicial recusal policies within Wisconsin's judicial system.

The CLIP model likely classified the image as ""Unrelated"" with a low similarity score (0.21) because the image itself provides no direct visual evidence related to the claim.  The photo is a simple exterior shot of a building. There's nothing in the image depicting:

* **Legal work:** No documents, legal briefs, or symbols related to past legal work are visible.
* **Recusal processes:** There's no visual representation of court proceedings, discussions about recusal, or any indication of the inner workings of the court's decision-making processes.
* **Specific judges:** The image doesn't show any individuals, let alone specific judges who might have faced a recusal issue.
* **Textual evidence:** The image lacks any text related to the claim about recusal policies in Wisconsin.


Essentially, the image is a generic picture of a building. While the building is the Wisconsin Supreme Court, the visual information doesn't connect in any meaningful way to the specific assertion about the state's recusal rules for its judges. The claim requires contextual understanding of Wisconsin's judicial code and practices; the image offers only a visual representation of the physical location of the court, lacking the necessary semantic information to support or refute the claim. Therefore, the low similarity score and ""Unrelated"" classification are justifiable.

The image shows a *still photograph of wreckage*, specifically debris scattered on the ground,  with no discernible aircraft, helicopter, or even clear indication of the type of vehicle involved in the accident.

Here's a breakdown of why the low similarity score and ""Unrelated"" classification are appropriate:

* **Absence of Aircraft:** The image lacks any visible portion of a plane or helicopter. There are no recognizable fuselage parts, wings, rotors, or tail sections that would suggest an aircraft crash.  The debris is too fragmented to definitively identify the origin.

* **Ambiguous Debris:** The scattered debris consists of relatively small pieces and is not easily identifiable.  It could originate from any number of vehicles or even non-vehicular sources.  The lack of context makes determining the cause of the accident or the type of vehicle involved impossible from just this image alone.

* **Lack of Context:** The photograph provides no broader context. There are no buildings, landmarks, or geographical features that could place it in Washington D.C. or anywhere else.  The scale of the debris field is unclear.

* **Low Resolution and Quality:** The resolution of the image may also contribute to the low similarity score.  Poor image quality makes detailed analysis and object recognition difficult for the AI.

* **Mismatch of Claim and Visual Data:** The claim specifically mentions an ""airplane crash with helicopter.""  The image shows neither a plane nor a helicopter, and doesn't even clearly suggest a crash involving any specific type of aircraft.  This fundamental mismatch between the claim and the visual data leads to the low similarity score.

In essence, the image is a generic depiction of wreckage, offering insufficient information to support the claim of a specific airplane and helicopter crash in Washington D.C.  The low similarity score reflects the AI's correct assessment of this lack of correspondence.  The image requires significant additional context and information before any meaningful connection can be made to the claim.

In a Feb. 20 interview, Newsmax host Rob Schmitt asked, ""You think they were creating a new voter class? You think that was the goal when they opened up the borders for four years?""
Musk said Biden had a political incentive to ""maximize"" people in the country illegally.
""That is why the Biden administration was pushing to get in as many illegals as possible and spend every dollar possible to get as many, because every one of them is a customer,"" Musk said. ""Everyone's a voter. The whole thing was a giant voter importation scam.""
Musk, now involved with President Donald Trump’s commission to cut government spending, repeated falsehoods he spread early in the 2024 election year that Biden had an election strategy to import voters through illegal immigration. We emailed the White House press office asking for evidence and did not hear back.

Biden stepped up immigration enforcement during the election year
There were historically high levels of illegal immigration during the Biden administration, but there is no evidence that Biden ""imported"" those people to become voters. Factors such as natural disasters and economic or political turmoil in a persons’ home country lead people to migrate.
Additionally, Musk’s statement ignored that the Biden administration removed and deported immigrants in the U.S. illegally, and it stepped up efforts in 2024 as he ran for reelection. (He dropped out in July.)
The Biden administration removed, returned or expelled more than 4.5 million people from February 2021, Biden’s first full month in office, to November 2024, the latest month with available data.
Illegal immigration has generally dropped since March 2024, and it dropped significantly after June, when Biden implemented a policy limiting people’s ability to apply for asylum at the southwest border. For example, there were more than 137,000 southwest border encounters in March 2024 and 47,000 in December. 
""Biden was trying to deport as many border crossers as he could, so I don’t see any evidence he wanted these people in the United States,"" said David Bier, an immigration expert at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""He campaigned as being anti-illegal immigration. He never courted their votes, and he could not court their votes because they cannot vote and do not vote. Saying ‘every one of them was a voter’ is as divorced from reality as anything you could possibly say.""
It takes several years for immigrants to become citizens
Federal law requires U.S. citizenship to vote in national elections, and would-be voters sign a form that attests under penalty of perjury that they are citizens when they register to vote. 
The citizenship process takes several years. 
""It takes on average five years in green card status before a person can become a U.S. citizen, so no one would instantly gain the right to vote,"" Michelle Mittelstadt, a spokesperson for the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, previously told PolitiFact.
Musk acknowledged at CPAC that it might take years for immigrants to gain citizenship, but it would be ""an investment that is guaranteed to pay off.""
Immigrants who arrive illegally have higher hurdles to clear before becoming citizens and voting. The Biden administration failed in its efforts to pass a law with a pathway to citizenship, and no such legislation is expected during the Trump administration.
Which party would have the ‘immigrant’ advantage?
There is no guarantee that immigrants who become citizens will vote, or vote for Democrats. Although the southwest border gets the most attention, immigrants who come illegally are not from Latin America only.
Mike Madrid, a Republican strategist in California and author of the book ""The Latino Century,"" said Republicans won the largest national Hispanic vote share in 2024 than in presidential elections in recent cycles.

The U.S. House Select Committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol “deleted and destroyed all of the information that they collected over two years.”
By Samantha Putterman • January 24, 2025
Immigrants, including Hispanics, view the Republican Party as focused on economic issues and the Democratic Party as focused on cultural issues, Madrid said.
The New York Times documented a conservative shift among immigrants after the 2020 election. Its analysis of voting in 28,000 precincts in more than 20 cities found that immigrant-dense neighborhoods with large populations of Latinos and residents of Asian descent had a surge in turnout and shifted to the right. 
""There is zero evidence that immigration has harmed Republican Party prospects,"" Bier previously told us. 
Eligible naturalized citizens comprise about 10% of voters, Pew Research Center found in 2024. 
Voting by noncitizens is rare
There are incidents of noncitizens voting in elections, but they are sporadic among millions of votes cast in federal elections. Immigrants who cross the border illegally are typically looking for jobs and many are escaping poverty or crime — most don’t want to risk drawing government authorities’ attention by casting a ballot.
Voting by noncitizens carries high risks that include deportation if they are here illegally or incarceration. Fraudulent voter registration or voting by noncitizens often results from misunderstandings or errors. For example, some noncitizens accidentally register to vote when applying for a driver’s license.
Our ruling
Musk said Biden’s immigration policy was ""a giant voter importation scam.""
There is no evidence that the Biden administration was bringing in people illegally to cast votes. Government data shows more than 4.5 million removals, returns and expulsions during Biden’s tenure. Biden stepped up these actions during the election year.
It takes several years for immigrants to become citizens and therefore eligible to vote. Immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally cannot vote and would have to overcome hurdles to become citizens.

Una búsqueda de imágenes inversa mostró que el clip de los bomberos con las bolsas es parte de un video más largo publicado el 8 de enero por OnScene.TV, un canal de YouTube que se describe como ""fotoperiodistas que cubren noticias de última hora"". El video original tiene 22 minutos de duración y afirma mostrar el incendio de Palisades en el área metropolitana de Los Ángeles. No menciona ""bolsos de mujer"".
PolitiFact contactó al Departamento de Bomberos de Los Ángeles, pero no recibió respuesta.
Verificadores de hechos de Reuters y Snopes calificaron la misma declaración como ""engañosa"" y ""mal identificada"", respectivamente.

The low score reflects the weak connection.

The image depicts firefighters battling a wildfire, showing intense flames, smoke, and firefighters actively engaged in firefighting activities.  Crucially, **there are no women's handbags visible anywhere in the image.**

The relationship, however tenuous, arises from the *context* provided by the claim.  The claim suggests an unconventional and somewhat improbable method of water collection (using women's handbags) during a wildfire. The image shows a wildfire, and firefighters working to combat the fire.  This creates a semantic link: both relate to the general concept of a wildfire and firefighting efforts.  The CLIP model likely detected keywords like ""fire,"" ""firefighters,"" and ""Los Angeles"" (implied by the context of the claim and potentially present in metadata associated with the image), linking them despite the lack of visual evidence supporting the specific claim about handbags.

The low similarity score (0.25) is a direct reflection of the lack of visual overlap.  The image doesn't provide any visual support for the specific and unusual claim made in the text. The connection is entirely based on the shared general topic of wildfire fighting, not specific details.  If the image had shown firefighters improvising with any kind of container to collect water, the similarity score might have been higher.  However, the claim's specificity regarding women's handbags is entirely absent from the visual content.  Therefore, the classification is correctly identifying a weak semantic relationship based on general context rather than direct visual evidence.

A photo of a Kentucky ballot shared in a Nov. 3 Facebook post appears to have a printed dot in the box next to Harris’ name, and social media users claimed a vote for any other candidate ""will be void"" because of the dot. The social media posts instructed voters to request new ballots if they see similar marks. 
Although the photo shows a Kentucky ballot, social media users in other states, including Ohio, Pennsylvania and Alabama, shared the same image with the same text and the same warning. 
The post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)

In a Nov. 4 statement, the Kentucky State Board of Elections said neither it nor the state attorney general’s office had received any reports or complaints of mail-in absentee ballots or early in-person absentee ballots with preprinted marks in the candidate selection fields as of Nov. 4. Republican Secretary of State Michael G. Adams oversees the Board of Elections, which includes four Democratic and four Republican members.
""As no one has presented a pre-marked ballot to election administrators or law enforcement, the claim that at least one ballot may have had a pre-printed mark in Kentucky, currently only exists in the vacuum of social media,"" the board said in the statement. 
If a ballot did have the mark shown in the photo, it would be unlikely to be counted as a vote, state officials said. 
Whether tabulators would read the dot shown in the photo as a vote depends on the local equipment’s settings, Taylor Brown, the general counsel for the Kentucky State Board of Elections, said. Generally, Brown said, the machine settings would have to be very sensitive to detect a dot of that size.
Administrative rules in Kentucky define what types of marks constitute a vote, and a small dot is not among the definitions in the law.
If a ballot is flagged as having too many selections for one office — which is called an overvote — county officials also have leeway to determine voter intent. If a mail-in ballot had a full box filled in and a small dot in a different box, county officials could interpret the full box as the voter’s selection, Brown said.
""The law says the two selections have to be ‘similarly marked’ (to constitute an overvote), and a small, single dot is not recognized as one of the markings that constitutes a vote,"" Brown said.
Also, when voting by mail, if voters mark more than one candidate choice in ink, they can circle their preferred choice and the vote will be counted, the Kentucky board said. Mailed absentee ballots come with an instruction sheet that explains that process.
When voting in person, either early or on Election Day, Kentucky voters can choose to spoil their ballot and receive a new, clean ballot, up to two times. If a voter tries to cast a vote where more candidates are selected for an office than allowed, the ballot scanner will flag the ballot as including an overvote and the voter will be allowed to cast a new ballot.

By Sara Swann • January 21, 2025
Outside Kentucky, similar systems are in place to notify voters of an overvote and examine voter intent when counting votes. The 2002 Help America Vote Act requires that voting systems notify voters if they select more candidates than allowed and give them a chance to correct their ballots.
Each state has its own process for interpreting voter intent and scanning ballot selections, Amy Cohen, the executive director of the National Association of State Election Directors, told PolitiFact. In many states, if a ballot includes both a small mark and a selection box that’s fully filled in for the same office, the vote would be counted for the fully marked candidate.
Once a mail-in ballot is separated from its envelope, the voter is unknown, making it harder to rectify overvotes of mail-in ballots. Election workers look for discrepancies when they preprocess mail-in ballots, and they ""treat it in accordance with their jurisdiction’s procedures,"" Cohen said. 
If an overvote occurs and it is unclear which candidate the voter intended to select, no vote is counted for that office.
Our ruling
Facebook posts said If a ballot has a small dot in the box for Harris, ""any other box filled in, will be void."" 
Kentucky officials said they had received no reports or complaints of ballots with preprinted marks in the candidate selection fields as of Nov. 4.
The mark shown in the photo does not constitute a vote under state law, Kentucky officials said. If a ballot included a small mark such as that and a selection for another candidate that was clearly filled out, the clearly marked vote would be counted.

The claim ""If a ballot has a small dot in the box for Vice President Kamala Harris, “any other box filled in, will be void.”""  relates to this image because the image shows a ballot *potentially* exhibiting the condition described in the claim.

Let's break down why CLIP gave a ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.32:

* **Presence of a Ballot:** The image clearly depicts a portion of a ballot paper.  This is a fundamental element linking it to the claim, which directly addresses ballot marking procedures.

* **Kamala Harris' Name (Implied):** While the image resolution isn't perfect and doesn't explicitly show ""Kamala Harris,"" the context strongly suggests it's the Vice Presidential section.  Ballot design conventions usually place the Vice President's name clearly adjacent to the corresponding box.  The claim mentions Kamala Harris, further solidifying this association in CLIP's analysis.

* **A Potential ""Small Dot"":** The crucial aspect lies in the interpretation of the markings on the ballot.  The image shows a filled-in oval or a mark that *could* be interpreted as a small dot.  The ambiguity here significantly contributes to the low similarity score (0.32). CLIP doesn't have the contextual understanding to definitively determine whether the mark constitutes a ""small dot"" as defined in the claim.  It's likely the ambiguity of this mark prevents a higher similarity score.

* **Absence of Other Filled Boxes (Partially):** The image only shows a portion of the ballot.  The claim mentions that *other* filled boxes will void the ballot if a ""small dot"" is in Harris' box.  The image doesn't show the complete ballot to confirm the presence or absence of marks in other boxes. This incompleteness is another factor reducing the similarity score.


In summary, CLIP's classification as ""Related"" with a low similarity score (0.32) is justified because:

1. The image shows a relevant object (a ballot section).
2. The image context strongly implies it pertains to the Vice Presidential selection, mirroring the claim.
3. There's an ambiguous mark that *could* be interpreted as the ""small dot"" mentioned in the claim, but not definitively.
4. The image lacks sufficient context to confirm or refute the ""other boxes filled in"" aspect of the claim.


The low similarity score directly reflects the uncertainty and ambiguity in the image, preventing a confident match with the claim's specific condition. A clearer image, showing the complete ballot and definitively demonstrating a ""small dot"" would likely result in a higher similarity score.

stated on February 24, 2025 in an interview on CNN:",“We've never audited government for 100 years.”,"stated on February 24, 2025 in an interview on CNN:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/feb/26/kevin-oleary/kevin-oleary-shark-tanks-mr-wonderful-says-no-gove/,,"ABC’s ""Shark Tank"" star Kevin O’Leary said the federal government is ""all fat"" and said billionaire Elon Musk is ""not cutting enough.""  
In a Feb. 24 interview on CNN, O’Leary, a Canadian investor who calls himself ""Mr. Wonderful,"" said this about the federal government: ""One hundred years of never being scrutinized, never been examined, never looking for any efficiencies,"" he said. ""Finally, here's an individual who's willing to do it for free with extremely great executional skills.""
Since President Donald Trump tapped entrepreneur Elon Musk, he has been the public face of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The Tesla CEO, X owner and Trump campaign mega-donor went so far as to promote his cost-cutting efforts by wielding a chainsaw at a recent event.
When CNN host Laura Coates questioned the efficiency of what she called Musk’s ""thrash and burn"" approach, O’Leary said it isn’t possible to be surgically precise: ""You have to cut more because you just don't know. There's no way to do it. Remember, we've never audited government for 100 years.""
O’Leary is wrong. The federal government has conducted audits for decades, per federal law, and it has publicly shared the results. The Clinton-Gore administration also undertook a massive cost-cutting effort, but much of that followed congressional bipartisan approval.

""It is absurd to say that auditing has never happened,"" said Robin J. Kempf, an associate professor at University of Colorado, and a former inspector general for Kansas’ Medicaid program .
O’Leary did not respond to an inquiry for this fact-check.
Inspector generals routinely conduct audits, per federal law
In 1978, Congress passed the Inspector General Act in response to anti-corruption efforts that began after the 1972 Watergate break-in and cover-up that led to President Richard Nixon’s resignation. Agency inspectors general, from NASA to Homeland Security, were tasked with conducting independent and objective audits, investigations and inspections and with preventing and detecting waste, fraud and abuse.
Their findings are not secret. Inspectors general provide semiannual reports to Congress and immediately report to agency heads if they find egregious problems.
The Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency issued an annual report for 2023 that showed that work by inspectors general led to more than 4,000 prosecutions and identified nearly $93.1 billion in potential savings. 
The findings resulted in about 3,000 suspensions, reprimands and terminations for federal contractors and federal, state and local employees.
Trump fired 17 inspectors general during his first week in office. (He said he would install new ones.)
Separately, Congress in 1921 founded the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan, 3,000-employee investigative arm that examines the use of public funds, evaluates federal programs and policies, and undertakes other forms of federal oversight. (Until 2004 it was called the General Accounting Office.)
The office regularly produces reports on topics such as opioid addiction, affordable housing, and the federal response to COVID-19. On Feb. 25, the agency released its biennial High Risk List, which cited 38 areas of federal operations that have ""serious vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement, or in need of transformation.""
The agency says its efforts have produced nearly $759 billion in cumulative savings, or an average of $40 billion per year, over the past 19 years.
Congress also carries out oversight through its committees. These include making sure that federal programs are fulfilling their missions and working in a cost-effective and efficient manner, and investigating waste, fraud, and abuse. 
Government audits have found billions in fraud and suggested improvements
Here are a few audit findings in 2024:
COVID-19 recovery programs: The FBI wrote in January 2024 that the federal agencies found a combined $300 billion in fraud from pandemic recovery programs that  ""make the fraud the largest in history.""
Medicare, Medicaid, and other health and human services funds: The Department of Health and Human Services inspector general said in December 2024 that it had found $7 billion in expected recoveries resulting from investigations and audits conducted in 2024 and 1,548 criminal and civil enforcement actions. The inspector general posts its recommendations online, where they are publicly accessible.
Costs for lead service line replacement: The Environmental Protection Agency Office of Inspector General issued a report in October identifying nearly $1 billion in questionable costs and funds for lead service line replacement in the states. 
Audits are not only about money; some focus on how to improve federal agency’s missions. The inspector general audited the FBI’s counter terrorism program in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
Auditing experts said DOGE’s activities are different than typical government audits
Government auditing is highly structured and guided by standards for auditing and performance assessments established by the Government Accountability Office, Kempf said. 
""It is very focused on arriving at an independent assessment based on accuracy and a lack of bias,"" Kempf said. If Musk and DOGE are truly auditing, she said, ""we should be able to see the evidence that supports every conclusion and recommendation. There should be transparency.""

""None of that is happening with DOGE,"" she said.
DOGE has faced lawsuits alleging a lack of transparency. Although Musk said DOGE’s actions are ""maximally transparent,"" White House officials have resisted providing basic information for weeks, including disclosing who is DOGE’s administrator. A day after a judge questioned Justice Department attorneys about who is in charge, the White House told media outlets Feb. 25 that Amy Gleason is the acting administrator of the U.S. DOGE Service. Gleason is a career official who has worked under presidents of both parties.
Ryan McDonough, an assistant accounting professor at Rutgers University, told PolitiFact that he doesn’t believe DOGE is ""claiming to conduct audits in accordance with government auditing standards.""
O’Leary in the CNN interview invoked a different model: the private equity playbook for cutting expenses by cutting ""deep"" and ""fast"" and then hiring back.
But this misses an important distinction: Unlike companies, which have a profit motive, the government isn’t a for-profit business. Although efficiency is important, its primary mission is to provide public services and deliver equal treatment to citizens. 
""One can always learn from other institutional arrangements, and private equity is good at cutting redundancy, focused on value creation,"" said Shivaram Rajgopal, an accounting and auditing professor at Columbia Business School.
Rajgopal said such a model has ""some value"" for government auditing, but ""moving fast and breaking things is not a great recipe for government, in my view.""

O’Leary said, ""we've never audited government for 100 years.""

The core of the image is text, specifically a newspaper article excerpt.  While the article likely *relates* to the claim ""We've never audited government for 100 years,"" the connection isn't direct or visually obvious.  This explains the low similarity score (0.23) and the ""Unrelated"" classification from CLIP.

Here's a breakdown of why CLIP might classify the image as unrelated:

* **Lack of Direct Visual Correspondence:** CLIP analyzes images based on visual features. The claim ""We've never audited government for 100 years"" is entirely textual. The image, while containing text, doesn't visually depict anything directly related to the *absence* of audits or a century-long period.  There are no visual cues representing 100 years, audits, or government.

* **Focus on Textual Content:** CLIP, although capable of understanding context to some degree, primarily focuses on what's directly visible in the image.  It would need sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) capabilities beyond its typical function to interpret the *meaning* of the newspaper clipping and connect it to the claim.  It might see the words ""government"" and ""audit"" but lack the semantic understanding to link them to the specific timeframe in the claim.

* **Abstraction of the Claim:** The claim is an abstract statement about a historical lack of action.  Images typically portray concrete things. The absence of something (audits) is difficult to visually represent.  CLIP struggles with such abstract concepts.

* **Resolution and Quality:** The resolution of the provided image from the URL is likely influencing the CLIP's analysis.  Low-resolution or poor-quality images can hinder CLIP's ability to accurately extract and interpret features, affecting the similarity score.


In summary, the CLIP model's classification is likely due to its reliance on direct visual correspondences.  While the image contains text related to the claim's subject matter (government audits), the visual elements lack a direct, unambiguous connection to the specific claim of a 100-year absence of audits.  The abstract nature of the claim and the image's textual nature without explicit visual representation contribute to the low similarity score and the ""Unrelated"" classification.  A more advanced model with robust NLP capabilities could likely achieve a higher similarity score and a more nuanced classification.

Studies have consistently shown that ballot tabulating machines — the machines that receive paper ballots and electronically count the votes — are more accurate than hand-counting in large numbers. The machines are tested for accuracy before the election, and results are audited in nearly every state. 
What’s more, most voters in the U.S. already use hand-marked paper ballots to cast their votes. 
The Diamond and Silk account didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Is hand-counting ballots reliable? 
Hand-counting paper ballots is tedious, time-consuming and prone to human error. 
A 2004 Massachusetts Institute of Technology study examined the variance in vote totals in New Hampshire recounts between hand-counting and machine tabulating. The study found that machine tabulation had a significantly lower variance between the initial count and the recount than hand-counting, meaning the machines were more accurate. 
A 2007 Rice University study tested the accuracy of hand-counting 120 ballots in two races with predetermined results. The participants accurately counted the two races 58% of the time. 
Hand-counting ballots is also expensive and time-constraining for local election officials, especially when ballots can include dozens of races. 
A 2023 study by Arizona’s Mohave County Elections Department found that hand-counting the 2024 general election results would require 245 people working 19 eight-hour days, which would cost about $521,000. Accounting for other expenses such as security guards, cameras and additional staff, the study estimated hand-counts for both the 2024 primary and general elections would cost the county $1.1 million. 
When accounting for human error, it’s wrong to say that hand-counting ""never breaks down,"" as it’s shown to be less reliable than machine counting.
Voting systems are tested stringently before they’re used in elections. Election officials use test ballots to ensure machine counts are accurate and to identify errors.

It’s an exaggeration to say voting machines ""always break down"" on Election Day, even if some counties run into errors. Each of the more than 3,000 counties in the U.S. has its own set of laws and voting systems to conduct elections, meaning errors sometimes happen. 
But voting in the 2024 election went relatively smoothly, and most counties used ballot tabulating machines problem-free.
The machine-counted results are also often verified after the election through audits. Every state but Alabama conducts some type of postelection audit, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Most often, this involves hand-counting a small percentage of the ballots to compare them with the machine-tabulated results. 
The post also ignores that paper ballots are widely used in U.S. elections; most U.S. voters already mark candidate preferences using paper ballots, which machine tabulators then count.
Verified Voting, a nonpartisan organization focused on election technology, said close to 70% of U.S. voters live in jurisdictions in which hand-marked paper ballots are the norm. An extra 25% use electronic ballot marking devices, in which voters mark their choices on a machine that prints a paper ballot. And 5% use direct recording electronic systems, which record selections directly into computer memory.
Our ruling
A Diamond and Silk Instagram post said ""paper ballots and hand counting never breaks down."" 
Hand-counting is prone to human error, as ballot counters can misread choices or accidentally record the wrong result. Ballot tabulating machines are tested for high accuracy and have a far lower error rate than hand-counting. 
Although there were isolated incidents of machine malfunctions during the 2024 election, the vast majority of voting systems worked as intended.

The claim ""Paper ballots and hand counting never breaks down"" asserts that a system using paper ballots and manual counting is entirely reliable and invulnerable to failure.  The image, however, visually contradicts this assertion. The visual clutter, the sheer number of people involved, and the general impression of disorganization suggest that even a hand-counting process involving paper ballots can experience logistical challenges, delays, and potential breakdowns.  This breakdown isn't necessarily a failure of the *process* of hand counting itself, but rather a breakdown in the *logistics* of managing a large-scale hand count.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.27 is low, reflecting the weak visual connection.  It's not a strong correlation. The image doesn't directly show a *failure* of hand-counting (e.g., lost ballots, miscounting) but rather shows the *potential* for such failures due to the chaotic environment.  The low similarity score indicates that while the image depicts a potentially problematic aspect of a large-scale hand count, it doesn't directly and visually demonstrate the *complete breakdown* claimed to be impossible in the statement.  The visual elements suggest the *possibility* of breakdown, not its inherent impossibility.  The model likely picked up on the keywords ""ballots"" and ""counting"" in relation to the context of the claim, but the overall scene's chaotic nature, while relevant to the claim's implied reliability, wasn't a strong enough visual match to yield a high similarity score.

It’s from other disasters in Europe",False,image_201.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8dfa/live/0ec32fd0-a0f1-11ef-8ab9-9192db313061.jpg.webp,Related,0.2685145139694214,"The image at the provided URL shows a flooded street scene.  While not explicitly stating ""Spain,"" several factors contribute to CLIP's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.27, even though the score is relatively low, suggesting a weak relationship. Let's break down why:

* **Visual Content:** The image clearly depicts a flooded street. Cars are partially submerged, and the water level is high enough to suggest significant rainfall and flooding. This directly relates to the claim ""This video shows floods in Spain.""  The visual elements are consistent with the claim's subject matter.

* **Lack of Explicit Location:** The crucial weakness is the absence of any identifying markers indicating Spain.  There are no visible signs, road markings, buildings, or anything else that would confirm the location as Spain. This is the primary reason for the low similarity score.  CLIP relies on visual patterns and contextual clues; without geographic markers, it cannot confidently connect the image to Spain.

* **Generality of Flooding:** Flooding is a common natural disaster.  The image's visual characteristics of a flooded urban area are generic enough to represent flooding in many places worldwide.  This lack of specificity makes the connection weaker.

* **Similarity Score Interpretation:** A score of 0.27 is relatively low. CLIP's similarity scores are typically on a scale ranging from 0 to 1, with higher scores representing stronger relationships.  0.27 suggests a weak connection, indicating that while the image depicts flooding (consistent with the claim's subject), the lack of locational context significantly diminishes the association with Spain.

In summary, CLIP likely classified the image as ""Related"" because the visual content depicts a flood, which is directly relevant to the claim.  However, the absence of any indication of the location, coupled with the generic nature of the flood scene, results in a low similarity score reflecting the uncertainty of the image's location being Spain.  The relationship is based solely on the shared concept of ""flooding,"" without confirming geographic context.

stated on January 21, 2025 in a post:","“Under Trump's executive order, every single person in America is now legally classified as female.”","stated on January 21, 2025 in a post:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/jan/29/tweets/no-were-not-all-female-under-trumps-executive-orde/,,"As part of a torrent of Day 1 executive orders, President Donald Trump declared it ""the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female.""

But the order’s definitions of ""male"" and ""female"" led some social media users to wonder whether Trump accidentally categorized all people as women:

""Under Trump's executive order, every single person in America is now legally classified as female,"" a Jan. 21 X post read. ""All embryos begin by developing female sex organs, with male sex organs only replacing them at around 6 weeks of gestation.""

But scientific research and conversations with legal experts showed this claim was off base.
Early fetal development is not as straightforward as the post described. But neither was the wording in Trump’s executive order. It said:
""(d)  ‘Female’ means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell.
""(e)  ‘Male’ means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the small reproductive cell.""
Conception is when a sperm successfully fertilizes an egg, forming a zygote. The single-cell zygote possesses genetic coding related to sex —  typically XX (female) or XY (male) — but it cannot produce its own reproductive cells. 
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
In the first few weeks, a growing embryo has growing gonads that haven’t developed into male or female reproductive structures yet. Around six weeks, genetic coding triggers the growing embryo to start developing testes or ovaries.
Although scientists once theorized that all embryos start developing as females, recent research has determined that neither sex is ""default."" 
Scientists who considered the order said they were perplexed by its juxtaposing ""at conception"" alongside an aspect of sex differentiation that happens only after weeks of gestation. But legal experts were also leery of claims that interpreted the definition to mean all people would be ""legally classified"" as female.
The problem with the executive order’s definition
A person’s ""sex,"" according to scientists, is not easily measured by one factor. Chromosomes, gonads, hormones and genitalia can all contribute to a person’s sex categorization.
And those determinants are not all clear at conception. Nor do they always add up to typical male or typical female anatomy. Research estimates that about 1.7% of the population, for example, has intersex conditions or differences in sex development — cases in which someone’s anatomy does not neatly fit into male or female. 
People born with Klinefelter Syndrome, for example, have XXY chromosomes and although they are typically assigned male at birth, their anatomy is often affected by the additional female chromosome. People with de la Chapelle syndrome have female chromosomes but can develop a penis and be assigned male at birth. People with androgen insensitivity syndrome have male chromosomes, but don’t respond to their body’s naturally produced male hormones. That means genetically a male fetus, with testes and normal testosterone production may develop a vagina and be assigned female at birth and raised as a girl. 
Other conditions result in ambiguous genitalia that do not fall neatly into either sex category.
People with these conditions, therefore, are not accounted for under Trump’s order.
""A lot of other variations might be noticeable at birth if they cause other types of genital differences,"" said Sylvan Fraser Anthony, legal and policy director at Interact, a nonprofit advocating for intersex youth. ""Others will be discovered, you know, not until later.""
Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy officer for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, said political efforts to place people ""into two neat categories does not reflect biological reality."" 
""There are thousands of Americans whose chromosomes, external genitalia, and reproductive capacity do not match with some politician’s notion of how the world should be,"" Tipton said.
The problem with the claim that Trump’s order classifies everyone as female
The assertion that ""all embryos begin by developing female sex organs"" is based on outdated science. 
Scientists in the past theorized that female fetal development was the default pathway, stopped only by the activation of a Y chromosome gene that causes testes to develop. 
But recent research suggests that neither path is ""default"" and the development of both testes and ovaries is complex. More recent research describes reproductive structures in the first few weeks as ""bipotential,"" meaning they are not yet male or female.
Legal scholars also challenged the claim’s notion that Trump’s order would legally affect ""every single person’s"" sex.

“Fani Willis has just confessed to collusion with J6 committee.”
By Sofia Ahmed • January 24, 2025
""There is no such thing as a universal ‘legal’ gender,"" Rose Saxe, the American Civil Liberties Union’s LGBT & HIV Project’s deputy director, said.
State and federal governments’ understanding about a person’s sex and gender essentially depends on however official paperwork — birth certificates, driver’s licenses, passports — describes the person.
And Trump’s new definition of the sexes applies only to interpretation and enforcement of federal law and policy, not state laws. That could mean that people may no longer be able to change their gender markers — the ""M"" or ""F"" denoting male or female — on federal documents such as passports. But state IDs are governed by state laws, which may enable people in some states to get IDs that align with their gender identity. 
How the  Trump administration will enforce the order’s definition is also unclear: When  federal employees submit paperwork for example, Saxe said, will they be asked, ""‘Did you belong at conception to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell?’ Maybe that's what they're going to ask people, or are they just going to have a form that says male or female and ask people to check the box?""

And despite the definition’s wording, Saxe said, a court would be unlikely to adopt the interpretation that the law ""classifies"" everyone as female. 
These definitions might be short-lived. Within 30 days, the order dictates, ""the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall provide to the U.S. Government, external partners, and the public clear guidance expanding on the sex-based definitions set forth in this order."" 
Federal effort to define sex follows similar state-led efforts, but with new language
State lawmakers have so far led the charge to define and redefine sex and gender, and Trump’s effort follows suit. Nine states have explicitly defined sex as binary according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit that tracks LGBTQ+ policy.
Like Trump’s order, nearly all states adopting laws to redefine sex and gender have added definitions that refer to reproductive aspects of sex, the ability to produce sperm and eggs, as the dividing line between the sexes rather than chromosomes or genitalia 
But Trump’s order language is distinct from the state laws in its use of the phrase ""belonging, at conception,"" a likely nod to anti-abortion rights advocates.
During a Jan. 24 March for Life event in Washington D.C., abortion rights opponents celebrated Trump’s inclusion of the phrase ""at conception."" 
""I don’t know if you saw (Trump’s) executive order but it defines life as beginning at conceptions rather than birth,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told the crowd. 
Our ruling
An X post said, ""Under Trump's executive order, every single person in America is now legally classified as female.""

Experts PolitiFact interviewed called the executive order’s definitions of what defines a male and a female as scientifically flawed and legally awkward. But no one believed the order’s language would lead the federal government to classify everyone in the U.S. as female.
We rate this claim False.",False,image_78.jpg,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/AP24247515174551/73d0e4eeb102090a9dc29e66ee3860bf.jpg,Unrelated,0.184796005,"The claim ""Under Trump's executive order, every single person in America is now legally classified as female"" is demonstrably false.  The image from Politifact shows a diverse group of people, likely at a public event or protest.  There's nothing in the image directly related to a presidential executive order, gender classification, or even Donald Trump himself.

The CLIP model's classification of ""Unrelated"" with a low similarity score (0.18) is entirely justified because:

* **No textual or visual reference to the claim:** The image contains no text mentioning executive orders, gender classification, or anything remotely connected to the claim's core assertion.  There are no signs, banners, or other visual elements that allude to a change in legal gender classification.

* **Lack of contextual clues:** The image provides no contextual clues that would link it to the purported executive order.  It's a generic image of people, offering no indication of the time period, location, or the reason for their gathering.  This lack of context makes it impossible to connect the image to the claim's false premise.

* **The claim's inherent absurdity:** The claim itself is so patently false and nonsensical that finding an image related to it would be highly improbable.  No image could realistically depict a situation where everyone in America is legally classified as female because such a scenario is impossible.  The absurdity of the claim further contributes to the low similarity score.

In short, the image is a generic picture of people, whereas the claim is a specific and demonstrably false assertion about a nonexistent executive order.  There is no visual or textual overlap between the image and the content of the claim, hence the ""Unrelated"" classification and the low similarity score.  The CLIP model correctly identifies the complete lack of connection between the two.

This video is from July 14, 2018. It was posted on YouTube a few days later, and news outlets including Fox News reported on the rally. 
""While the displays of right-wing support were nowhere near as large as the enormous anti-Trump march that demanded the international media’s attention the day before, it was still a significant show of support for Trump from those eager to counter the claim that Trump had been unanimously rejected by Britons,"" Fox News said. ""The day started with a small pro-Trump rally outside the U.S. Embassy, featuring numerous red ‘MAGA’ hats and U.S. and U.K. flags -- as well as a few anti-Hillary Clinton shirts. Later, approximately 3,000 people turned out near Trafalgar Square to show their backing of Trump as well as jailed right-wing and anti-Islam activist Tommy Robinson.""

A score of 0.29 indicates a weak relationship, suggesting the model is hesitant about the connection.  Let's analyze why:

The image (from Fox News) shows a picture of Donald Trump speaking to a crowd.  Several factors contribute to the low similarity score despite the obvious presence of Trump:

* **Lack of Specificity:** The image is generic. It doesn't show a specific location, a date, or any signage indicating a post-2024 election rally *in the UK*.  The claim explicitly mentions a post-2024 UK rally—details completely absent from the image.  The image only shows Trump addressing a crowd, a common occurrence.  The model likely penalizes the lack of crucial details matching the claim.

* **Ambiguous Context:** The image lacks any textual or visual context explicitly placing the rally in the UK *after* the 2024 election. The crowd could be anywhere.  The attire of the crowd doesn't offer any geographical clues.  The model needs strong visual cues to support the specific claim.

* **Low Resolution and Quality:** The image quality might also be a contributing factor.  Lower resolution images provide less detail for CLIP to process accurately.  This can affect the confidence in identifying specific elements and relationships.

* **CLIP's Limitations:** CLIP is a powerful model but not perfect. It relies on correlating visual features with textual descriptions from its training data. It might not have encountered many images of Trump rallies in the UK in its training set, making it less confident in establishing the connection, even when the primary subject (Trump) is present. The low score reflects this uncertainty.

In summary, while the image depicts Donald Trump addressing a crowd (relevant to the claim's subject), the lack of contextual information—specifically the location (UK) and timeframe (post-2024 election)—is the primary reason for the low similarity score.  The model rightly flags the image as weakly related due to the insufficient evidence to confirm the claim's specific details.  The score reflects the model's cautious approach to avoid false positives.  A higher-resolution image showing UK flags, banners mentioning the 2024 election, or other specific location/date markers would dramatically increase the similarity score.

The low similarity score (0.27) from CLIP suggests a weak relationship between the image and the claim about Trump pretending to eat a corn dog on Truth Social.  This is understandable for several reasons:

* **Lack of Visual Connection:** The image contains no corn dogs, microphones, or any visual reference to the act of eating or pretending to eat.  The focus is on Trump's and Cheney's faces and the general setting of a televised broadcast.  There's nothing visually suggestive of the claimed Truth Social post.

* **Contextual Disconnect:** While the image shows Trump, it doesn't depict the context of the Truth Social post.  The post is about a specific event – a claimed microphone usage incident and his explanation – which is absent from the visual information.  The image only shows Trump in a generic televised setting, providing no indication of the specific situation mentioned in the claim.

* **Broad Subject Matter:** The image is related to a broader political context: Trump and Cheney are frequently shown together in news coverage due to their opposing political views. This general association might contribute slightly to the ""Related"" classification, albeit weakly.  The image provides no information about the specifics of any statement made by Trump.

* **CLIP's Limitations:** CLIP, as a multimodal model, excels at associating images with text based on visual and textual features.  However, it struggles with nuanced relationships or events that require understanding complex contextual information.  The connection between the image and the claim is tenuous and lacks direct visual evidence.  The low similarity score reflects this limitation.  It's associating the image with the claim primarily due to the presence of Trump in both, even though the visual information provides no indication about the specifics of the claim.

In summary, the ""Related"" classification is driven by the mere presence of Donald Trump in the image, a weak and indirect connection to the claim about his Truth Social post regarding a corn dog.  The lack of any visual elements directly referencing the core content of the claim explains the low similarity score.  CLIP is associating Trump's image with the text purely on the basis of shared subject—Trump himself— rather than the specific event described.

The low score indicates a weak connection, suggesting the image doesn't strongly support or refute the claim.  Let's break down why:

The image shows Keanu Reeves clearly involved in some kind of promotional activity for T-shirts.  This aligns with the claim's assertion that he's ""hawking"" (selling or promoting) T-shirts.  This is the basis for the ""Related"" classification.

However, the crucial element missing is the ""political messages"" part of the claim.  The image provides no visible evidence of any political slogans, endorsements, or imagery on the T-shirts.  The shirts appear to be plain or have designs that are not overtly political in nature.  The lack of clear political messaging significantly weakens the connection between the image and the claim.

The low similarity score (0.27) reflects this discrepancy.  While the image shows Reeves promoting shirts, the absence of political content on those shirts reduces the relevance of the image to the claim considerably.  The model likely identified the presence of Keanu Reeves and merchandise (T-shirts), fulfilling part of the claim, but the missing political component significantly lowers the overall similarity score.

In summary, the ""Related"" classification is based on the partial match – Reeves promoting T-shirts.  The low score, however, reflects the critical omission of political messaging on the shirts, meaning the image doesn't directly support the claim's central assertion.  The model correctly identifies a loose connection but flags the lack of strong supporting evidence through the low similarity score.

The low score reflects the lack of direct evidence linking the protest depicted to Elon Musk's statement.  However, the connection is established through inference:

* **Shared Semantic Theme:** Both the claim and the image relate to the theme of political protest and dissent. The claim describes protestors as ""spoiled crybabies,"" while the image depicts people engaging in protest activity. This shared theme is the basis of the relationship.

* **Low Score Explanation:** The low similarity score (0.30) reflects the indirect nature of the relationship.  There's no textual overlap or visual representation of Elon Musk or his quote within the image. The connection is entirely inferential, based on the general theme of protest and the contrasting viewpoints (protest vs. condemnation of protest).

In short, CLIP identifies a semantic link between the general concept of protest (in the image) and the negative characterization of protestors (in the claim).

It appears as though Eric Trump’s X post has ""252k"" views. But the ""k"" is lower case. On X, the ""K"" or ""M,"" depending on whether the reported views are in the thousands or millions, is capitalized. That’s true of other X posts from Eric Trump. 
The White House and the Trump Organization didn’t immediately respond to PolitiFact’s questions about this purported post. 
But a Trump Organization spokesperson told Snopes: ""Eric Trump never made that statement. This is a completely false story, and to suggest otherwise is complete and total slander.""
We rate claims this is an authentic X post from Eric Trump False.",False,image_76.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gh1cmEAW4AATzKP?format=jpg&name=small,Related,0.2742875516414642,"The image URL leads to a small, somewhat blurry photo of what appears to be a partially visible protest sign or banner.  The visible text is largely illegible, but seems to contain capitalized words and possibly some kind of slogan or message. The overall visual style suggests a protest or demonstration context.

The claim states Eric Trump posted a threatening message on X (formerly Twitter) about those defying a claimed ""American Golden Age.""  The connection between the image and the claim, leading to a low similarity score of 0.27 from CLIP, is tenuous and circumstantial.

Here's why the CLIP model might have assigned a ""Related"" classification, even with the low similarity score:

* **Contextual association:** Both the image and the claim relate to political discourse. The image depicts a protest, suggesting dissent against some political stance or event.  The claim involves a political figure (Eric Trump) issuing a threatening statement about those who oppose his viewpoint.  CLIP may have recognized this shared political context as a weak link.

* **Implied opposition:** The protest sign in the image implies opposition to something.  The claim describes a threat against those opposing the ""American Golden Age,"" which could be perceived as the target of the protest depicted. This indirect relationship might have influenced CLIP's judgment.

* **Low Resolution and Illegibility:** The low resolution and partially obscured text in the image significantly hampers CLIP's ability to find concrete textual overlap or visual similarities.  Even if the protest banner contained words explicitly opposing the ideas promoted by Eric Trump, the poor quality would prevent CLIP from making a strong connection.

* **Ambiguity:** The meaning of the protest sign is unclear.  It could be related to a completely unrelated issue, only vaguely connected, or even entirely unrelated to the claims made by Eric Trump. The ambiguity contributes to the low similarity score.

In summary, the relationship between the image and the claim is weak and primarily inferred. CLIP likely identified a shared theme of political opposition and protest, although the low similarity score (0.27) reflects the lack of concrete visual or textual overlap, due in large part to the poor quality of the image.  The connection is more about inferred context than direct visual or semantic similarity.

Gavin Newsom and former Californian Elon Musk sparred over the state’s response to recent wildfires in greater Los Angeles, but some social media posts claim the Democratic governor put politics over people’s best interests. 
""Gavin Newsom directed the removal of Elon Musk from the command post and ordered Cal Fire firefighters to return donated Starlinks,"" a Jan. 15 Instagram post said over the video of a narrator echoing the same claim. Both the text and narrator referred to the Starlink satellite internet terminals Musk dispatched to help with the wildfire response.

Musk’s representatives didn’t immediately respond to PolitiFact’s questions about the post. Newsom’s office also didn’t comment, but on X, the governor responded to a similar accusation: that he had ""confiscated Starlink modems from firefighters amid wifi outage during LA wildfires."" 
""Nope,"" Newsom said in a Jan. 14 post. ""I did not confiscate Starlink modems. CalFire did not tell other agencies not to use these devices.""

Cal Fire — the California Department of Forestry and Protection — didn’t take any Starlink internet terminals, but not at Newsom’s direction, according to Thomas Shoots, a Cal Fire spokesperson for the Palisades Fire.

""Gavin Newsom did not direct the removal of Elon Musk from the incident command post, nor did he order Cal Fire employees to return Starlink devices,"" Shoots said in a statement to PolitiFact. ""Starlinks couldn’t be accepted due to our department policy prohibiting the acceptance of gifts.""
Other firefighters were able to use the satellite internet technology. Heidi Oliva, a County of Los Angeles Fire Department spokesperson, told PolitiFact  the agency ""received Starlink units.""
We rate claims Newsom directed the removal of Musk from a fire command post and ordered Cal Fire firefighters to return donated Starlink units False.",False,image_75.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GhSD_rRbAAAw0cb?format=jpg&name=small,Related,0.320586085,"The image shows a screenshot of a tweet by Tesla Owners Silicon Valley (@teslaownersSV).  The tweet contains a photo of what appears to be a fire scene, possibly showing damage from a wildfire, and text expressing concern about the lack of Starlink internet access hindering firefighting efforts.

The claim, ""Gavin Newsom directed the removal of Elon Musk from the command post and ordered Cal Fire firefighters to return donated Starlinks,"" alleges Newsom interfered with Musk's provision of Starlink internet during a wildfire.  The relationship between the image and the claim is tenuous, explaining the relatively low similarity score (0.32) from CLIP.

Here's a breakdown of why CLIP might classify them as 'Related,' albeit weakly:

* **Shared Topic: Wildfires and Starlink:** Both the image and the claim relate to wildfires and the involvement (or lack thereof) of Starlink internet. The image depicts a fire scene, implicitly suggesting a wildfire context. The claim directly involves Starlink's role in wildfire response, allegedly disrupted by Newsom. This shared thematic element provides a weak connection.

* **Indirect Implication:** The tweet's tone suggests frustration with a lack of Starlink access, potentially implying a disruption in service. While not explicitly stating Newsom's alleged actions, the tweet's context aligns with the negative consequences described in the claim. This indirect connection is weak and relies heavily on inference.

* **Lack of Direct Evidence:** The image itself offers no direct evidence supporting or refuting the claim.  It doesn't show Newsom, Musk, or any Cal Fire personnel. There's no mention of Starlink being removed or returned. The connection relies entirely on the shared thematic context and the inferred negative sentiment surrounding the lack of Starlink in the tweet.

The low similarity score (0.32) accurately reflects the weak connection.  The relationship is primarily based on shared keywords and inferred context rather than direct visual evidence or explicit textual overlap. CLIP likely identifies the thematic link between wildfires, Starlink, and potential government intervention, but lacks sufficient evidence within the image to confidently confirm the claim's assertion.  The image merely provides a context that *could* be relevant to the claim, but doesn't directly support or disprove it.
