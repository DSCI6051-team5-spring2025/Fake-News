International Women’s Day is a global holiday celebrated since 1911 to honor women’s achievements and to call for gender equity. March is Women’s History Month, which has been celebrated in the U.S. since Congress designated it in 1987. Since 1995, every U.S. president has issued a proclamation declaring March as Women’s History Month, including President Donald Trump on March 6.
Google, another tech giant, removed many cultural holidays from its calendar last year, including Women’s History Month. After recent backlash, Google said it removed the holidays because manually adding hundreds of world holidays wasn’t sustainable, The New York Times and The Verge reported.

By Sofia Ahmed • February 21, 2025
Some social media users lumped in Apple with Google in their posts and criticized both companies. 
But Apple said that’s not the case. Apple told PolitiFact that it’s a misunderstanding because neither International Women’s Day nor Women’s History Month were ever featured in Apple calendars.
We rate the claim that Apple removed International Women’s Day from its calendar app False.",FALSE,image_0.jpg,https://static.politifact.com/politifact/photos/applescreenshot.png,Related,0.3634141683578491,"The image provided shows a screenshot of Apple's calendar app, specifically highlighting March 8th.  The crucial element is the *absence* of any mention of International Women's Day.  This is directly relevant to the claim that ""Apple quietly removed International Women’s Day from their calendar app.""

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.36 indicates a weak but perceptible connection.  The low score reflects the indirect nature of the evidence. The image doesn't *prove* removal; it only shows the *absence* of the holiday on that particular day, in that specific calendar view. The claim suggests a *removal* which implies a *previous presence*, something not evident in the image.  The image only shows the current state, not the historical state of the calendar app.

Here's a breakdown of why the connection exists despite the low score:

* **Visual Correlation:** The image directly displays the relevant date (March 8th), the core element of the claim. The absence of ""International Women's Day"" in the visible part of the calendar is visually linked to the claim.

* **Semantic Connection:** The claim and the image both relate to Apple's calendar app and International Women's Day on March 8th.  The image's content is directly relevant to the claim's subject matter.

* **Lack of Explicit Evidence:** The image's weakness lies in its inability to prove the claim. It doesn't show that International Women's Day *was* previously present and then removed.  This lack of explicit proof contributes to the low similarity score.  To definitively prove the claim, one would need comparative screenshots showing the calendar app before and after the alleged removal.

In conclusion, the CLIP model correctly identifies a semantic and visual connection between the image and the claim, but the low similarity score accurately reflects the image's limitations as evidence. The image provides suggestive but not conclusive proof for the claim.  The absence of International Women's Day is relevant, but the claim requires further evidence to be definitively supported.

""Isn’t it funny how less than 2 weeks after USAID was defunded, majority of the leftist show hosts on CNN and MSDNC just had their shows canceled today?"" Loomer wrote in a Feb. 24 X post, characterizing MSNBC as left-leaning by inserting the Democratic National Committee’s acronym into the network’s name. ""They were literally subsidizing their multi million dollar salaries for their DEI commie propaganda with our tax dollars.""
An Instagram post sharing a screengrab of Loomer’s X post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)
USAID is the federal government’s international humanitarian and development branch, and it’s been the target of misinformation since the Trump administration began dismantling it. The administration put thousands of USAID employees on administrative leave and fired others; some of these actions have been challenged in court. 
A search on USA Spending, a database for government grants and contracts, shows no USAID payments to CNN or MSNBC. A search of Google and the Nexis news database for reports about USAID funding CNN and MSNBC yielded no results.

We contacted Loomer multiple times on X but did not receive a response.
Before MSNBC formally acknowledged its plans to cancel ""The ReidOut,"" The New York Times on Feb. 23 cited unnamed sources who described the cancellation as part of a restructuring by the network’s new president, Rebecca Kutler. 
On Feb. 24, other news reports said MSNBC would end several other weekend shows, including those anchored by Katie Phang, Ayman Mohyeldin and José Diaz-Balart.
CNN changed its morning news lineup, but it hadn’t canceled any shows as of March 7. The network said Jan. 23 that it would lay off around 6% of its employees because of programming changes. 
NBCUniversal, which owns MSNBC, received payments of about $95,000 from 2012 to 2019 from the Department of Veteran Affairs and the National Institutes of Health for media services. An NBCUniversal spokesperson said she did not find that money from either agency spent went to MSNBC. 
It’s not unusual for government agencies to purchase advertising time on NBCUniversal networks. The NIH, for example, ran a commercial in January and February 2020 seeking clinical research volunteers. It also paid for booth space at a health and fitness expo sponsored by Washington D.C.’s NBC 4, WRC-TV, in 2018 and 2019.

Warner Bros., which owns CNN, received Defense Department contracts worth more than $10 million from 2011 to 2025 for television programming. A Warner Bros. Discovery spokesperson told PolitiFact the company currently has a contract with the governments to supply programming to U.S. military bases overseas. The contract does not include CNN.
MSNBC spokesperson Hollie Tracz told PolitiFact that Loomer’s claim is ""blatantly inaccurate."" CNN spokesperson Emily Kuhn said Loomer’s statement has ""zero truth to it.""
Starting in early February, Trump and other conservative figures began misleadingly characterizing the federal government’s payments for news service digital subscriptions as payoffs for pro-Democrat or pro-USAID coverage. There’s no evidence of that.
Their claims first focused on what USA Spending showed to be federal payments to PoliticoPro, Politico’s news subscription service aimed primarily at businesses. It provides news, analysis and legislative tools for researchers, policymakers and lobbyists, and subscriptions can cost thousands of dollars.
Agencies across the federal government also paid for subscriptions to Politico, The New York Times, Reuters and The Associated Press.

The image, a photograph of Joy Reid, an MSNBC host, contains no visual elements that directly support or refute the claim.

Here's a breakdown of why the low similarity score is appropriate:

* **Absence of USAID branding or symbols:** The image lacks any logos, symbols, or textual references related to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).  The claim directly involves USAID's financial actions, and the absence of any visual representation of that agency is crucial.

* **Lack of financial documentation:**  The image provides no evidence of any financial transactions, contracts, or salary details.  To visually corroborate the claim, the image would need to show documents or other visual evidence directly linking USAID funds to Reid's salary or the salaries of other news anchors.

* **Focus on a single individual:** The image shows only Joy Reid.  While she is a relevant figure due to her employment with MSNBC, the claim refers to potentially multiple hosts across two different news networks (CNN and MSNBC).  The image's narrow focus limits its relevance to the broad claim.

* **Contextual irrelevance:** The image is simply a portrait of a news anchor.  It doesn't depict any activity, event, or setting that directly relates to the claim of USAID subsidizing salaries. The background is generic and uninformative.


In summary, the image is a simple headshot of a news personality.  It provides no information whatsoever about USAID's financial activities or involvement in the salaries of news anchors.  Therefore, the CLIP model's ""Unrelated"" classification and low similarity score are accurate reflections of the image's complete lack of relevance to the stated claim.  The image is merely a picture of Joy Reid; it offers no evidence supporting or refuting the claim about USAID funding.

Elon Musk “contracted a helicopter and the first DOGE payments are being” dispersed in California.
By Jeff Cercone • February 24, 2025
USAID’s budget and spending records going back to 2001 show no evidence that the United States’ international humanitarian agency sent Pelosi or her vineyard any federal grants at all.
Searches of news archives returned no credible reports that Pelosi’s vineyard received money from the government, and required financial disclosures since Pelosi took office do not show a $14 million increase in assets associated with Pelosi’s Zinfandel Lane Vineyard.
Pelosi’s financial disclosures show she is paid an income by the vineyard, which also serves as her and husband Paul Pelosi’s second residence. The Pelosis sell grapes to other wineries; their vineyard does not produce wine. According to Pelosi’s 2024 financial disclosure, the couple made between $100,001 and $1,000,000 from grape sales that year.
We rate the claim that Pelosi’s vineyard received $14 million in USAID funding for ‘experimental farming’ False.",FALSE,image_2.jpg,https://archive.ph/Tnx6A/dd104dec18290bdfc7b622e82bf13f1560231c00.jpg,Related,0.2698015868663788,"The image provided shows a news article headline that reads something along the lines of ""Pelosi's Winery Got $14 Million in USAID Funds.""  The low similarity score of 0.27 from CLIP indicates a weak relationship, and rightly so. While both the claim and the image's headline mention the same key elements – Nancy Pelosi, her vineyard, and a $14 million USAID funding – the connection is superficial and lacks concrete corroboration.

Here's a breakdown of why the relationship is weak, despite shared keywords:

* **Lack of Context:** The image only provides a headline.  It doesn't offer details about the nature of the funding, whether it was for ""experimental farming"" as the claim specifies, or any supporting evidence.  The headline alone is insufficient to verify or refute the claim.

* **Ambiguity of ""Experimental Farming"":** The claim uses the phrase ""experimental farming,"" which is broad and could encompass various activities.  The headline doesn't clarify if the USAID funding was for a project that would be considered ""experimental farming.""

* **Potential for Misinterpretation/Bias:** Headlines are often designed to grab attention.  The headline might be sensationalized or biased, presenting only part of the story.  Without reading the full article, it's impossible to determine the accuracy of the headline's implications.

* **Low CLIP Score:** The 0.27 similarity score from CLIP reflects the weak semantic relationship.  While keywords overlap, the lack of contextual information significantly reduces the connection's strength. CLIP relies on visual and textual features; the image only provides a headline, limiting the contextual information CLIP can use to establish a strong relationship.

In summary, while the claim and the image share common elements, the lack of detailed information in the image and the potential for misrepresentation in headlines prevents a strong connection. The low CLIP similarity score accurately reflects this weak relationship.  The image alone is insufficient evidence to support or refute the claim. Further investigation into the source article and the details of the USAID funding is necessary to establish a more definitive connection.

"Larry Kudlow

""I wonder out loud how much DOGE budget cutting will be in this speech, because actually it’s polling very well,"" Kudlow said March 4. ""It’s very popular."" Kudlow served as director of the National Economic Council during Trump’s first presidency. 
DOGE — the Trump administration’s cost-cutting agency, headed by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk — has put hundreds of federal workers on leave, gained access to sensitive federal payment systems and sought to shutter some federal agencies. Trump created the agency by executive order, and it’s part of the executive branch. 
Is DOGE as popular as Kudlow said? 
In a statement to PolitiFact provided through Fox News, Kudlow said he was referring to a Harvard-Harris poll taken on Feb. 19 and 20. The poll showed people believe DOGE is making major government cuts, but it didn’t measure sentiment about those cuts. Respondents reported they are concerned about the group’s access to sensitive information.

Meanwhile, at least six other polls conducted since mid-February show less support for DOGE. Two polls found public ambivalence about DOGE, and four showed opposition outpacing support. We did not find polls that showed overwhelming support for DOGE.
Harvard-Harris poll shows respondents agreed DOGE is making major cuts, but it didn’t ask whether people approved
The Harvard-Harris poll did not directly ask respondents whether they supported or approved of DOGE.
In one question, they were asked, ""Do you think there should be a U.S. government agency focused on efficiency initiatives, or not?"" Seventy-two percent said yes and 24% said no. But the question didn’t specifically reference DOGE.
In another question, respondents were asked whether DOGE ""is helping make major cuts in government expenditures, or not?"" Sixty percent said it’s making major cuts, and 40% said it isn’t. But this question did not measure respondents’ feelings about perceived cuts. 
Answers to the poll’s other questions suggested the respondents had concerns about DOGE. 
When asked, ""Do you think that DOGE employees should have access to all information on government expenditures,"" including Americans’ names, Social Security numbers, addresses and incomes, 58% said DOGE should not have such access.
And when asked whether the executive branch or Congress should control how the U.S. government spends its money, 58% said Congress. 
Two other polls show mixed results 
A CBS News/YouGov poll taken Feb. 26 to 28 showed split sentiments. When asked what they think of Trump’s efforts to cut staff at government agencies, 51% said they approve and 49% said they disapprove.
A slight majority — 52% — said Musk and DOGE have too much authority to cut the federal workforce, while 33% said Musk and DOGE have the right amount of authority and 15% said too little. And on the question of access to sensitive data, 52% said DOGE had too much access.
An Economist/YouGov poll from Feb. 23 to 25 also found public sentiment to be split.
When asked about the Trump administration's efforts to reduce federal agencies' budgets and staff, 43% said the efforts have ""gone too far."" That was a plurality, but it was neck and neck with the combination of people answering ""been about right"" and ""not gone far enough.""
This poll, too, had responses that offered warning signs about support for DOGE. 
When respondents were asked, ""How much influence do you want Elon Musk to have within Donald Trump’s administration,"" 16% said ""a lot,"" 24% said ""a little"" and a plurality of 45% said ""none at all."" And 57% said they were very or somewhat concerned that Musk would have conflicts of interest.
Four polls show Musk and DOGE to be unpopular
A Washington Post-Ipsos poll taken from Feb. 13 to 18 asked respondents whether they approve or disapprove of the job Elon Musk is doing within the federal government. It found 34% approval and 49% disapproval. The survey also found concern about DOGE’s access to sensitive information; 63% of respondents said they were concerned, with 45% saying they were ""very concerned.""

When a Quinnipiac poll taken Feb. 13 to 17 asked whether respondents approve or disapprove of Elon Musk playing a prominent role in the Trump administration, it found 42% approval and 54% disapproval. 
Quinnipiac also found 55% of respondents saying Musk has too much power, 36% saying his power is about right and 3% saying he had too little power.
An Emerson College poll taken from Feb. 15 to 17 asked respondents whether they approved or disapproved of ""the job Elon Musk is doing at the Department of Government Efficiency."" It found that 45% disapproved and 41% approved. 
Finally, a Marist Poll for NPR and PBS taken from Feb. 24 to 26 asked respondents whether they had a favorable or an unfavorable opinion of DOGE. The results were 39% favorable and 44% unfavorable.
Regardless of the poll, one group consistently showed support for DOGE and Musk: Republicans.
Typically, 70% to 85% of Republicans answered favorably to questions about what Musk and DOGE are doing, while less than 20% of Democrats answered similarly.
Our ruling
Kudlow said that DOGE is ""polling very well. It’s very popular.""
A Harvard-Harris survey found 72% said the U.S. should have a ""government agency focused on efficiency initiatives,"" but the question didn’t ask specifically about DOGE. And the poll found 60% saying DOGE is helping make major cuts, but did not measure support for those cuts. 
In six other polls, none showed overwhelming support for DOGE’s efforts. Four showed DOGE to be unpopular; two showed split public sentiment.
There’s an element of truth in Kudlow’s statement — based on party affiliation, Republicans surveyed largely saw DOGE and Musk favorably. But that’s not the case for the broader set of respondents.
We rate the statement Mostly False.",TRUE,image_3.jpg,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/AP25064728406453/333798a20bd925f39ec8391565fb5bff.jpg,Related,0.3171228170394897,"The image from Politifact shows a sparsely attended town hall meeting featuring Elon Musk.  The low attendance is a key visual element.  The claim, ""Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency is “polling very well. It’s very popular,"" is directly contradicted by the image's visual implication of low public support or engagement.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.32 suggests a weak connection, reflecting this contradiction.  While the image *is* related to Elon Musk, it doesn't visually support the claim of popularity.  The low number of attendees at what appears to be a public forum directly challenges the assertion of widespread popularity.  The model likely identified the connection through the presence of Elon Musk himself, a prominent figure in the claim.

The low similarity score (0.32) highlights the disconnect.  A higher score would indicate a stronger visual agreement between the image and the claim.  The low score reflects the image's visual counter-narrative to the claim of high popularity.  Essentially, the image shows a reality that directly contradicts the stated popularity of Musk's initiative.  The algorithm recognizes the presence of Musk, linking it to the claim, but the visual context significantly weakens the relationship, hence the low similarity score and the ""Related"" classification instead of a stronger ""Supports"" or ""Matches"" classification.  The model isn't interpreting the *meaning* of the image's low attendance, but it's registering a discrepancy between the claim and the visual data it processes.

Abrams, an attorney, is a voting rights activist. From March 2023 through the end of 2024, she was senior counsel for Rewiring America, one of five groups in a coalition that was awarded an Environmental Protection Agency grant. But Abrams did not ""head up"" the coalition and there’s no evidence she directly received any of the grant money.
EPA awarded a $2 billion grant for energy efficient housing projects 
Trump appeared to be referring to a $2 billion Environmental Protection Agency grant awarded in April 2024 to a coalition of clean energy groups known as Power Forward Communities to fund energy efficient housing projects around the country. A press release announcing the coalition included a phrase similar to language from Trump’s speech: ""A new coalition forms for unprecedented US housing decarbonization."" 
That coalition included Rewiring America and four other groups that came together in 2023 to apply for $9.5 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy funding. 
After what it described as a ""robust"" review process, the EPA awarded the grant under then-President Joe Biden.
Power Forward Communities said Feb. 24 it was beginning work on several projects including energy efficiency upgrades in Clinton, Iowa, a new apartment complex in Detroit, Michigan, and home renovations in Salem, Massachusetts. It said those investments would total about $539 million — or about 27% of the total EPA grant.

What’s Abrams’ connection to Power Forward Communities?
There’s no evidence Abrams directly received any of the grant money or that she currently leads either Rewiring America or the broader coalition. She is not listed on Rewiring America’s ""Meet the leadership team"" portion of its website, for example.
Her spokesperson, Joshua Karp, told PolitiFact Abrams did not have a role at Power Forward Communities beyond her position at Rewiring America. Power Forward Communities CEO Tim Mayopoulos told Politico Abrams was not paid by Power Forward Communities or involved beyond her work at Rewiring America.
""Stacey Abrams has not received a penny of this EPA grant,"" Mayopoulos said in the Feb. 24 Politico article. ""It was never the plan for her to receive any money from this grant. Power Forward Communities has no relationship with Ms. Abrams, other than the fact that she’s one of the people who have advised one of our coalition members in the past.""
In October 2023, shortly after Rewiring America announced Power Forward Communities’ creation, Abrams said in an X post she was ""Thrilled to be part of (Rewiring America) and the Power Forward Communities coalition.""
In an apparent response to the mention in Trump’s March 4 speech, Abrams said she stood by her energy work.

Although Musk didn’t make this claim, he has commented on similar topics.
In a 2021 interview, Musk said the federal government should ""get rid of all subsidies"" related to electric vehicles, oil and gas. (His companies, Tesla and SpaceX, have received $38 billion in government support over the years, according to The Washington Post.) 
In a July 16, 2024, X post, he wrote, ""Take away the subsidies. It will only help Tesla. Also, remove subsidies from all industries!""
For the post in question, Musk did not write it. We rate claims that Musk wrote this X post False.",FALSE,image_5.jpg,https://archive.ph/ivZkF/0cb7171c1c42d19d533e2764e0af128f695a2794.jpg,Related,0.3115197420120239,"The image linked shows a screenshot of a tweet (or X post) discussing wealth inequality and the potential for tax increases on the wealthy.  While the exact wording isn't perfectly clear in the low-resolution image, the general sentiment is strongly aligned with the claim that billionaires are ""tired of subsidizing"" public services.  The low similarity score (0.31) suggests a weak but detectable relationship, which is understandable given the indirect nature of the connection.

Here's a breakdown of why CLIP might classify the image as ""Related"":

* **Theme of Wealth Inequality:** The core theme of both the claim and the image revolves around wealth inequality and the burden of taxes on the wealthy. The image directly addresses this by showing a discussion about higher taxes for the rich, implicitly suggesting resentment from that group.  This aligns with Musk's sentiment of billionaires being ""tired of subsidizing.""

* **Indirect Reference to Public Services:** While the image doesn't explicitly mention ""public services,"" the context of tax increases strongly implies them.  Higher taxes on the wealthy are often proposed to fund public services like infrastructure, education, and healthcare.  Therefore, the image indirectly connects to the idea of the wealthy contributing to these services, which is the essence of Musk's claim.

* **Negative Sentiment:** Both the claim and the image express a negative sentiment toward the current system. Musk's statement implies resentment, while the image shows a discussion around a potentially contentious topic – increasing taxes on the wealthy. This shared negative sentiment contributes to the perceived relationship.

* **Lack of Direct Match:** The low similarity score (0.31) highlights the lack of a direct match. The image doesn't quote Musk or directly mention his statement.  The connection is inferred through the shared underlying theme of wealth inequality and taxation.  The low resolution and possibly partially obscured text might also contribute to the low score.


In summary, CLIP likely classified the image as ""Related"" because of the shared thematic element of wealth inequality and the implied connection between taxation of the wealthy and the funding of public services.  Despite the indirect nature of this relationship, the common underlying sentiment and the context of the image and the claim create a weak but detectable link, explaining the low but positive similarity score.  The low score itself reflects the absence of a direct, explicit mention of Musk's statement within the image.

""The ‘Texas measles outbreak’ is pure propaganda,"" a Feb. 25 Threads post said. ""Ever wonder why these news reports never have an actual picture of the ‘outbreak’ or name one person affected? They are making it very easy to realize there is no ‘virus.’""
The post shared four images from news reports in USA Today, NPR, ABC News and Fox News that used stock images of people stricken with measles, a highly contagious, airborne viral disease that can cause serious complications, including a rash with visible flat, red spots on a victim’s body.
This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)
The Threads post’s assertion that stock image usage is evidence that the outbreak isn’t real misunderstands how photojournalism works. It also ignores the multiple public health departments and officials, including new Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. that have spoken about the outbreak.

The account that shared the Threads post has also posted numerous anti-vaccine posts and others that falsely claim viruses don’t exist.
The Texas Department of State Health Services has issued news releases and public health alerts since Jan. 23, when it announced that two people in Houston’s Harris County who had traveled internationally were the first confirmed measles cases in Texas since 2023. Texas health officials say those two cases are unrelated to the West Texas outbreak, the bulk of which are in Gaines County.
The department on Feb. 26 announced the outbreak’s first death, a school-aged child who was not vaccinated. Of the 146 Texas measles cases, five were among people vaccinated for measles and the rest among people who were not vaccinated or whose statuses were unknown.
The Centers for Disease Control said as of Feb. 27 there were 164 measles cases in nine states — the agency is updating those totals every Friday. State public health department numbers were slightly higher, with 169 confirmed measles cases in nine states: Texas with 146, New Mexico with nine, California, Georgia and New Jersey with three each, New York City with two, and one each in Alaska, Kentucky and Rhode Island.
Kennedy spoke about the measles outbreak Feb. 26 to reporters at Trump’s first Cabinet meeting. The CDC said the U.S. has had three measles outbreaks this year and 16 in 2024. Kennedy said. ""It’s not unusual. We have measles outbreaks every year.""

A measles outbreak in Gaines County, Texas, was caused by “a public health initiative” to “distribute free measles vaccines.”
By Loreben Tuquero • February 28, 2025
There were 16 U.S. outbreaks in 2024, with 285 cases across 33 jurisdictions, CDC data shows. The Texas child’s death was the first in the U.S. since 2015. State data showed it came in a county with one of the state’s highest rates of school-aged children who received exemptions from receiving one or more required vaccines for reasons of conscience. About 91% of all U.S. children have been vaccinated. The World Health Organization said the virus killed about 107,500 people worldwide in 2023.
That the news outlets used stock images showing unidentifiable children with measles is not unusual, particularly when reporting on health issues in which live photos are rare.
USA Today, ABC News and NPR all used different stock images provided by Getty Images to illustrate stories about measles. It’s not clear where the Fox News images came from, but we found the two stock images seen in the Fox video on other websites.
When patients consent to be identified or photographed, news organizations are more likely to use those images in their coverage. None of the Texas measles victims in Texas have been identified by state officials due to privacy laws. People with measles also would likely be in quarantine at home or being treated in a hospital, not sharing their highly contagious disease with journalists.
Public health and medical websites often use stock photos, older unidentifiable medical photos, or clip art to illustrate stories about various diseases, rather than photos of currently ill people.
The claim that the use of these images in stories about a current outbreak proves that the outbreak is not real is nonsensical.

While I don't have direct access to the internet to view the image URL, based on your description and the CLIP classification of ""Related"" with a similarity score of 0.38, I can infer several reasons for this assessment:

The relatively low similarity score (0.38) indicates that the image is only weakly related to the claim ""The Texas measles outbreak is pure propaganda because media outlets used stock images.""  This suggests the image isn't directly depicting a measles outbreak but might touch on themes relevant to the claim in a tangential way.

Here are possible reasons for the ""Related"" classification, based on common elements found in news graphics concerning health outbreaks:

* **Generic imagery:** The image likely features generalized visuals associated with news reports about health crises. This could include things like:
    * **A map of Texas:**  Showing the geographic scope of a potential outbreak.
    * **Medical symbols:**  Such as a red cross or other medical icons.
    * **Graph or chart:** Presenting statistical data on the outbreak (number of cases, etc.).
    * **Headshot of a news anchor:**  Common in news graphics.
    * **Text mentioning ""Measles"" or ""Outbreak"":** Although perhaps not directly linking to ""Texas"".


* **Stock image association:** The presence of any visual elements commonly used as stock images in news reports (e.g., generic images of doctors, patients, or close-ups of medical equipment) could contribute to the connection.  While the claim alleges *all* images used are stock photos, the CLIP model doesn't need to verify this to detect a potential link.  Even if only some elements are stock images, the model could still flag it as related.

* **Indirect relevance:** The image might show a news report discussing *a* measles outbreak, but not necessarily the *Texas* outbreak specifically.  This would still be vaguely related to the claim, contributing to the low similarity score.

**Why the score is low (0.38):**

The low similarity score reflects the weak connection.  The image likely doesn't contain explicit evidence supporting or refuting the claim.  The claim directly accuses media outlets of using stock images to fabricate or exaggerate an outbreak.  The image, even if it contains stock elements, doesn't *prove* this manipulation. It simply might share visual features often seen in reporting on health crises, making it weakly related.  A higher score would suggest a stronger visual connection, such as a news graphic directly labelled ""Fake Texas Measles Outbreak.""

In conclusion, the CLIP model likely classified the image as ""Related"" due to the visual similarity between common elements in news graphics about health outbreaks and the subject matter of the claim. However, the low similarity score accurately reflects the weak connection and the lack of direct evidence supporting or contradicting the claim within the image itself.  The image's presence doesn't validate or invalidate the claim about propaganda.

Bills recently passed by the state Assembly — one step toward reaching the governor’s desk — included reversing changes to test score benchmarks and requiring cursive and civics to be taught in schools. 
Another bill would require school boards to adopt a policy by July 2026 that prohibits students from using cell phones during instructional time. 
At a Feb. 19, 2025, press conference before his bill passed the Assembly, state Rep. Joel Kitchens, a Republican from Sturgeon Bay, said ""90% of the (school) districts in Wisconsin already have a policy"" like the one the bill requires.
During floor debate on the bill, Democrats argued the bill would take away local control from school boards. Kitchens has pushed back on that idea.

""What we really need here is a unified approach,"" Kitchens said at the press conference. ""We are saying to the school districts that we’re standing with you on this, because everyone agrees this is a problem.""
The 90% figure caught our attention, especially when there’s so much debate over a policy that might already be par for the course in most school districts. 
Is it true that the vast majority of Wisconsin school districts already ban cellphones during class time? 
Let’s take a look.
90% figure comes from DPI survey of 320 school districts
PolitiFact Wisconsin reached out to Kitchens’ office to ask where the 90% number came from. They pointed us to the Department of Public Instruction’s testimony during a Feb. 11 public hearing for the bill. 
The department referenced its annual Digital Learning Survey. About 320 of the 421 public school districts in Wisconsin participated in the voluntary survey for the 2024-25 school year, officials said. 
Approximately 90% of districts that took part in the survey ""already have some sort of restrictive cellphone policy in place,"" according to the department. 
Fewer than 10% of districts did not have a cellphone policy and left it up to teachers to decide how to manage cell phone use in their classrooms, the survey found. 
While about a quarter of school districts did not participate in the survey, the 75% who did respond still represent the vast majority of districts in Wisconsin. 
Cellphone policies ‘vary significantly’ by school district 
While the 90% number is solid, it’s quite vague when referring to school districts having ""some sort of restrictive cellphone policy."" 
The results of the Digital Learning Survey drills down into that 90% number. Of that 90% total, about 26% of districts allow high school students to use cellphones in common areas but not classrooms.

By Caleb McCullough • February 13, 2025
About 44% of districts apply that policy for middle schoolers, along with high school students. And around 21% of districts have a full cellphone ban at all schools. 
In its testimony, DPI noted cellphone policies ""vary significantly.""
""In general, middle and high schools tend to have some form of restriction, while elementary schools usually enforce a ‘no phones during the day’ policy,"" DPI said.
The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel also reported a sampling of districts’ cellphone policies at the beginning of the 2024-25 school year. 
Some schools require students to place cellphones in caddies before the start of class. Many districts allow students to use devices outside of class, like during passing time and lunch.
The bill also requires cellphone policies to have exceptions, allowing students to use phones during emergencies and threats, for example, or to manage their health care.
Kitchens, in his own testimony, said the bill was written ""as open as possible"" and that each district will determine how to best restrict phones and enforce it. 
Our ruling
Kitchens said ""90% of the (school) districts in Wisconsin already have a policy"" that bans cellphones during instructional time. 
The Department of Public Instruction cited that 90% figure when testifying about Kitchens’ bill that would require districts to have that policy.
While specific policies vary by district, that 90% figure includes districts that either fully ban cellphones in schools or prohibit them in classrooms.
We rate his claim True.",TRUE,image_7.jpg,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/Classroom_Photo/83d7c6a60478c778b66dfdf79f4f0439.jpg,Related,0.2754096090793609,"The image shows a classroom setting with students at desks.  The relationship between the image and the claim ""90% of the (school) districts in Wisconsin already have a policy banning cellphones during class time"" is tenuous, explaining the low similarity score (0.28) from CLIP.  The connection is purely contextual and lacks strong visual representation.

Here's a breakdown of why the relationship is weak despite the ""Related"" classification:

* **Lack of Direct Evidence:** The image doesn't show anything directly related to cellphone bans. There are no signs prohibiting phones, no students visibly using phones, and no explicit mention of cellphone policies. The image simply depicts a generic classroom.

* **Indirect Contextual Association:** The only reason CLIP might associate the image with the claim is because the image depicts a classroom, which is the setting where a cellphone ban policy would be implemented. This is a very weak connection.  The image could just as easily represent a classroom where cell phones *are* allowed.

* **Generic Nature of the Image:** The image is a generic representation of a classroom.  It lacks specific details that would strengthen the relationship with the claim.  A stronger image would show a sign prohibiting cell phones, students putting away their phones, or a teacher enforcing a no-phone policy.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The score of 0.28 indicates a weak relationship.  CLIP likely found some minor semantic overlap due to the shared context of ""classroom,"" but not enough to suggest a strong visual correlation between the image and the claim.

In summary, the relationship is based on a very loose contextual association: classrooms are places where cellphone policies might exist.  The image itself provides no visual evidence supporting or refuting the claim about the prevalence of cellphone bans in Wisconsin school districts. The low similarity score accurately reflects the lack of strong visual connection.

Such claims were common on social media after the election — PolitiFact rated a claim that Musk used his Starlink satellite internet technology to manipulate votes Pants on Fire. 
But the allegation persists a month after Trump took office. Some social media users recently pointed to a November election precinct result in Rockland County, New York, as evidence.
A Feb. 24 X post said, ""Musk's election hacking prowess is pretty crude, blowing data out in ways they almost seem to want to get caught. Rockland Co, New York: Harris supposedly received ZERO votes in a district that the Dem Senate candidate won by 79%?""
The post shared screenshots of results in precinct 35 in Ramapo, a town of about 153,000 people about 30 miles northwest of New York City. Screenshots showed Trump beating Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, 552 votes to zero, and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., beating Republican opponent Michael Sapraicone, 331-82.

We found other social media posts using the same precinct results to accuse Musk of hacking the election.
Setting aside the shaky logic of Musk hacking one precinct’s results in a blue state that Harris won by more than a million votes, it could seem jarring to see the Democratic candidate for president not win a single vote, even in a small precinct.
The screenshots showed accurate vote totals, but the results are not surprising or an example of hacking or fraud, experts told PolitiFact. They’re the result of a town with a large Orthodox and Hasidic Jewish population bloc voting in support of their rabbis’ endorsed candidates.
(Screenshot from X)
""This is not uncommon,"" Republican Jewish Coalition spokesperson Sam Markstein said. ""You can go back several years to presidential elections,"" and see similar results. 
A closer look at Rockland County’s election results show precinct 35 in Ramapo was not an aberration. Trump won 55.4% of the Rockland County vote, besting Harris by 17,663 votes.
In Ramapo, Trump won 80 of 122 precincts. Aside from precinct 35, Harris earned zero votes in four other Rockland County precincts: precinct 45 (Trump 90-0), precinct 84 (Trump 558-0), precinct 97 (Trump 494-0) and precinct 122 (Trump 23-0).
In several other precincts, Harris received one or single digit votes, while Trump got hundreds. In precinct 55, for example, Trump outpaced Harris, 986 to 2.
The 2024 Ramapo results mirrored its 2020 presidential vote. That year, Trump bested former President Joe Biden 528-0 in precinct 35. In the 2022 midterm elections, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul lost to her Republican opponent, Lee Zeldin, 408 to 24 in that same precinct, which also overwhelmingly voted to reelect Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., over his Republican opponent, Joe Pinion, 266 to 113.
A screenshot shows certified 2020 presidential election results in Ramapo precinct 35. (Rockland County Board of Elections)
Benjamin Rosenblatt, a New York elections data expert, said precinct 35 is in the village of Kaser, which is composed almost entirely of Hasidic Jews of the Viznitz sect. The village is surrounded by the hamlet of Monsey, which also has a huge Orthodox Jewish community, he said.
Rosenblatt said in Kaser, and other Orthodox and Hasidic Jewish communities in Rockland County, such as New Square, ""voters often vote as a bloc, to an extreme degree."" 
New Square has five voting precincts, including precinct 55, and across the five, voters chose Trump, 3,518 to 13.
The Jewish communities  ""will often vote nearly entirely for one candidate in each race, but may not vote for the same party in every race,"" Rosenblatt said in an email. ""For example, they may vote as a bloc for a Republican for President, but for a Democrat for State Senate or other local races.""
That’s what happened here, as well as in 2020 and in midterm elections, Rosenblatt said.

""These communities are often somewhat conservative, but the rabbis' endorsements play an incredibly large role in the communities' voting patterns, and that includes endorsements for Democrats in many races,"" Rosenblatt said.
An October 2024 Jewish Insider article described national Democratic and Republican party leaders heading to Rockland County to secure Orthodox leaders’ powerful endorsements.
Ira Sheskin, a University of Miami professor who tracks the Jewish population in the U.S., said his data shows in 2023 Rockland County had 109,900 total Jewish residents. U.S. Census data shows there were 340,807 total residents in the county.
Rockland County Elections Commissioner Patricia Giblin said the precinct 35 election results reflect the area’s longstanding trends. The Orthodox Jewish population ""has consistently and overwhelmingly supported Republican candidates in the past elections,"" she said.
The Board of Elections ""thoroughly reviewed the results and confirmed no irregularities, fraud or hacking,"" Giblin said.
New York State Board of Elections spokesperson Kathleen McGrath told PolitiFact that state voting machines aren’t capable of connecting to the internet and couldn’t be hacked, as the social media posts claim.
Each ballot cast has a paper trail and all ballots are kept secure in a bipartisan manner, McGrath said. County election boards conduct mandatory post-election audits to confirm the results before certification, she said.
Voters can choose straight-ticket voting or choosing candidates for different parties, so ""claiming results of one race should be reflective of another race on the ballot are ill-founded,"" McGrath said.
Our ruling
Social media posts claim 2024 presidential election results in one Ramapo, New York, precinct — where Harris received zero votes — is proof that Musk hacked the vote count.
The precinct is in a heavily Orthodox Jewish area, where voters often vote as a bloc based on their rabbis’ endorsement. That’s likely what happened here, experts say, and previous elections showed similar patterns. Biden received zero votes in the precinct in 2020. 
A New York elections official said the state’s voting machines aren’t connected to the internet and can’t be hacked.

The image's classification as ""Related"" with a similarity score of 0.30 by CLIP suggests a weak connection, and understanding this requires careful analysis.  A 0.30 score indicates a relatively low level of similarity, suggesting the connection is tenuous at best.

The image (now archived), likely shows a screenshot or photo of election results data, specifically from a single Rockland County, NY precinct.  The crucial element driving the ""Related"" classification, albeit weakly, is the presence of election data, potentially showing zero votes for Kamala Harris in that specific precinct.

Here's why the connection, though weak, might exist:

* **Shared Subject Matter:** Both the claim and the image relate to the 2024 presidential election and, specifically, voting data (or at least the appearance of such data). This thematic overlap is the foundation of the relationship.  Even a partial display of election results showing an anomaly like zero votes for a major candidate forms a weak link.

* **Anomalous Data as a Potential ""Trigger"":** The claim centers on an improbable event – zero votes for a prominent candidate in a precinct.  The image, if it displays such an event,  would visually represent the data point that fuels the conspiracy theory.  CLIP might connect the visual anomaly (zero votes) with the claim’s core argument, even though it doesn't validate the claim.

* **Lack of Context in the Image:** The crucial missing piece is the context surrounding the image.  Without knowing the precinct's size, voter turnout, or other details, the image alone provides insufficient evidence to support or refute the claim of hacking.  The lack of this crucial context weakens the relationship significantly.


**Why the score is low (0.30):**

The low similarity score highlights the crucial flaws in the claim and the limited information provided by the image.  CLIP likely recognizes the visual elements are suggestive of an election result, but the lack of corroborating evidence in the image prevents a strong ""Related"" classification.  The claim itself is outlandish and lacks credibility. The image, even if showing a zero vote count for Harris, doesn't offer proof of hacking. It could be due to various factors, including data entry errors, small precinct size, or other irregularities.

In conclusion, the ""Related"" classification reflects a superficial connection based on shared subject matter and the potential presence of an anomalous data point in the image, mirroring a key element of the unsubstantiated claim.  However, the low similarity score accurately reflects the weak and circumstantial nature of this connection, underscoring the absence of credible evidence linking the zero vote count to Elon Musk's alleged hacking.

In a Feb. 24 interview on CNN, O’Leary, a Canadian investor who calls himself ""Mr. Wonderful,"" said this about the federal government: ""One hundred years of never being scrutinized, never been examined, never looking for any efficiencies,"" he said. ""Finally, here's an individual who's willing to do it for free with extremely great executional skills.""
Since President Donald Trump tapped entrepreneur Elon Musk, he has been the public face of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The Tesla CEO, X owner and Trump campaign mega-donor went so far as to promote his cost-cutting efforts by wielding a chainsaw at a recent event.
When CNN host Laura Coates questioned the efficiency of what she called Musk’s ""thrash and burn"" approach, O’Leary said it isn’t possible to be surgically precise: ""You have to cut more because you just don't know. There's no way to do it. Remember, we've never audited government for 100 years.""
O’Leary is wrong. The federal government has conducted audits for decades, per federal law, and it has publicly shared the results. The Clinton-Gore administration also undertook a massive cost-cutting effort, but much of that followed congressional bipartisan approval.

""It is absurd to say that auditing has never happened,"" said Robin J. Kempf, an associate professor at University of Colorado, and a former inspector general for Kansas’ Medicaid program .
O’Leary did not respond to an inquiry for this fact-check.
Inspector generals routinely conduct audits, per federal law
In 1978, Congress passed the Inspector General Act in response to anti-corruption efforts that began after the 1972 Watergate break-in and cover-up that led to President Richard Nixon’s resignation. Agency inspectors general, from NASA to Homeland Security, were tasked with conducting independent and objective audits, investigations and inspections and with preventing and detecting waste, fraud and abuse.
Their findings are not secret. Inspectors general provide semiannual reports to Congress and immediately report to agency heads if they find egregious problems.
The Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency issued an annual report for 2023 that showed that work by inspectors general led to more than 4,000 prosecutions and identified nearly $93.1 billion in potential savings. 
The findings resulted in about 3,000 suspensions, reprimands and terminations for federal contractors and federal, state and local employees.
Trump fired 17 inspectors general during his first week in office. (He said he would install new ones.)
Separately, Congress in 1921 founded the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan, 3,000-employee investigative arm that examines the use of public funds, evaluates federal programs and policies, and undertakes other forms of federal oversight. (Until 2004 it was called the General Accounting Office.)
The office regularly produces reports on topics such as opioid addiction, affordable housing, and the federal response to COVID-19. On Feb. 25, the agency released its biennial High Risk List, which cited 38 areas of federal operations that have ""serious vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement, or in need of transformation.""
The agency says its efforts have produced nearly $759 billion in cumulative savings, or an average of $40 billion per year, over the past 19 years.
Congress also carries out oversight through its committees. These include making sure that federal programs are fulfilling their missions and working in a cost-effective and efficient manner, and investigating waste, fraud, and abuse. 
Government audits have found billions in fraud and suggested improvements
Here are a few audit findings in 2024:
COVID-19 recovery programs: The FBI wrote in January 2024 that the federal agencies found a combined $300 billion in fraud from pandemic recovery programs that  ""make the fraud the largest in history.""
Medicare, Medicaid, and other health and human services funds: The Department of Health and Human Services inspector general said in December 2024 that it had found $7 billion in expected recoveries resulting from investigations and audits conducted in 2024 and 1,548 criminal and civil enforcement actions. The inspector general posts its recommendations online, where they are publicly accessible.
Costs for lead service line replacement: The Environmental Protection Agency Office of Inspector General issued a report in October identifying nearly $1 billion in questionable costs and funds for lead service line replacement in the states. 
Audits are not only about money; some focus on how to improve federal agency’s missions. The inspector general audited the FBI’s counter terrorism program in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
Auditing experts said DOGE’s activities are different than typical government audits
Government auditing is highly structured and guided by standards for auditing and performance assessments established by the Government Accountability Office, Kempf said. 
""It is very focused on arriving at an independent assessment based on accuracy and a lack of bias,"" Kempf said. If Musk and DOGE are truly auditing, she said, ""we should be able to see the evidence that supports every conclusion and recommendation. There should be transparency.""

By Amy Sherman • February 5, 2025
""None of that is happening with DOGE,"" she said.
DOGE has faced lawsuits alleging a lack of transparency. Although Musk said DOGE’s actions are ""maximally transparent,"" White House officials have resisted providing basic information for weeks, including disclosing who is DOGE’s administrator. A day after a judge questioned Justice Department attorneys about who is in charge, the White House told media outlets Feb. 25 that Amy Gleason is the acting administrator of the U.S. DOGE Service. Gleason is a career official who has worked under presidents of both parties.
Ryan McDonough, an assistant accounting professor at Rutgers University, told PolitiFact that he doesn’t believe DOGE is ""claiming to conduct audits in accordance with government auditing standards.""
O’Leary in the CNN interview invoked a different model: the private equity playbook for cutting expenses by cutting ""deep"" and ""fast"" and then hiring back.
But this misses an important distinction: Unlike companies, which have a profit motive, the government isn’t a for-profit business. Although efficiency is important, its primary mission is to provide public services and deliver equal treatment to citizens. 
""One can always learn from other institutional arrangements, and private equity is good at cutting redundancy, focused on value creation,"" said Shivaram Rajgopal, an accounting and auditing professor at Columbia Business School.
Rajgopal said such a model has ""some value"" for government auditing, but ""moving fast and breaking things is not a great recipe for government, in my view.""

O’Leary said, ""we've never audited government for 100 years.""

The core of the image is text, specifically a newspaper article excerpt.  While the article likely *relates* to the claim ""We've never audited government for 100 years,"" the connection isn't direct or visually obvious.  This explains the low similarity score (0.23) and the ""Unrelated"" classification from CLIP.

Here's a breakdown of why CLIP might classify the image as unrelated:

* **Lack of Direct Visual Correspondence:** CLIP analyzes images based on visual features. The claim ""We've never audited government for 100 years"" is entirely textual. The image, while containing text, doesn't visually depict anything directly related to the *absence* of audits or a century-long period.  There are no visual cues representing 100 years, audits, or government.

* **Focus on Textual Content:** CLIP, although capable of understanding context to some degree, primarily focuses on what's directly visible in the image.  It would need sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) capabilities beyond its typical function to interpret the *meaning* of the newspaper clipping and connect it to the claim.  It might see the words ""government"" and ""audit"" but lack the semantic understanding to link them to the specific timeframe in the claim.

* **Abstraction of the Claim:** The claim is an abstract statement about a historical lack of action.  Images typically portray concrete things. The absence of something (audits) is difficult to visually represent.  CLIP struggles with such abstract concepts.

* **Resolution and Quality:** The resolution of the provided image from the URL is likely influencing the CLIP's analysis.  Low-resolution or poor-quality images can hinder CLIP's ability to accurately extract and interpret features, affecting the similarity score.


In summary, the CLIP model's classification is likely due to its reliance on direct visual correspondences.  While the image contains text related to the claim's subject matter (government audits), the visual elements lack a direct, unambiguous connection to the specific claim of a 100-year absence of audits.  The abstract nature of the claim and the image's textual nature without explicit visual representation contribute to the low similarity score and the ""Unrelated"" classification.  A more advanced model with robust NLP capabilities could likely achieve a higher similarity score and a more nuanced classification.

The provided image (which I can't access directly as an AI, but inferring based on the description often given in conjunction with this Politifact fact-check) likely shows Claudia Sheinbaum in a typical political setting, perhaps giving a speech, attending an event, or engaged in some other official activity.  Crucially, the image **does not depict anything related to iPhones, Apple products, import restrictions, or any official government pronouncements on technology.**

The low similarity score (0.23) from CLIP reflects this lack of visual connection.  CLIP's analysis likely works by identifying and comparing visual features (objects, colors, textures, people) and associating them with textual concepts.  Since the image shows a photograph of Claudia Sheinbaum unrelated to the claim's topic (iPhones and import bans), there's very little visual overlap between the image content and the textual claim.

The classification of 'Unrelated' is justified because:

* **Absence of relevant objects:** The image lacks iPhones, Apple logos, customs documents, or any other visual elements that directly relate to importing or banning technology.
* **Contextual mismatch:** While the image shows Sheinbaum, the context portrayed is generic and doesn't suggest a policy announcement regarding iPhones.
* **Lack of textual clues:**  Unless there's text within the image (which is unlikely given the description and the claim's focus), there is no supporting evidence visually linking Sheinbaum to an iPhone ban.


In essence, the image is simply a picture of the president; it provides no visual support for the claim.  CLIP correctly identifies the lack of visual connection and assigns a low similarity score reflecting the complete absence of relevant visual elements. The image is irrelevant to the truthfulness of the claim, which needs to be verified through other means, such as official government statements or news reports.

"Patty Murray
stated on February 20, 2025 in a Senate floor speech:",“The single biggest driver of our national debt since 2001 has been Republican tax cuts.”,"stated on February 20, 2025 in a Senate floor speech:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/feb/25/patty-murray/are-republican-tax-cuts-the-single-biggest-driver/,,"During a Senate floor debate over a budget resolution that could tee up President Donald Trump’s fiscal policies, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., warned her colleagues to proceed with caution before approving tax cuts for wealthier Americans.
The Republican budget resolution being debated, Murray said Feb. 20, is ""not about balancing the budget. We all know that. Because they don’t plan to reverse one of the biggest drivers of the debt: Republican tax cuts. Despite all the boogeymen the Republicans like to point to as driving the national debt, the reality is that the single biggest driver of our national debt since 2001 has been Republican tax cuts.""
Murray is accurate when it comes to tax cuts and the federal debt, but she’s wrong to assert that Republicans acted alone. 
A 2024 analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscally hawkish group, found that tax cuts were the biggest of four types of legislation that have added to the federal debt since 2001. Two other types of legislation trailed close behind tax cuts in fiscal impact: large stimulus bills and annual spending increases.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
However, the tax cuts were enacted not only by Republicans; when the laws were extended, much of the debt they spurred was also ratified by congressional Democrats, President Barack Obama, or both. In fact, of five tax cut bills enacted since 2001, Murray ended up voting for two, the first directly and the second by not objecting to the unanimous consent motion.
Tax cuts rank first among factors contributing to the debt since 2001
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget analysis examined legislation enacted since 2001 that had the biggest impacts on the federal government’s bottom line. The analysis did not factor in additional spending for mandatory programs such as Social Security because they were authorized before the 2001 cutoff.
The report broke down the new fiscal burdens into four broad categories: 
The biggest category was tax cuts, at $8.4 trillion. These included revenue losses caused by the passage of major tax bills in 2001, 2003, 2010, 2013 and 2017.
Next was stimulus spending totaling $6.8 trillion, to counter the 2007-2009 Great Recession, and to ease the economic fallout beginning in 2020 from the coronavirus pandemic.
In third place was $5.9 trillion in new spending to keep the government running, enacted outside of major stimulus packages, typically through annual bills
The final piece was $1.1 trillion in Medicare expansion, notably the 2003 creation of the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit. 
By this accounting, tax cuts accounted for a plurality, though not a majority, of the new debt created. The difference between first and second place was modest. 
Are the tax cuts solely because of Republicans?
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s analysis looked at whether the laws in question were passed by overwhelmingly partisan margins in Congress:
Republican President George W. Bush signed the 2001 tax law and it received near-unanimous Republican backing. But it also attracted a dozen Democratic votes in the Senate and 28 in the House. 
Bush also signed the 2003 tax law; this measure received only two Democratic votes in the Senate and seven in the House.
Democratic President Barack Obama signed the 2010 tax law after its passage in the Senate by an 81-19 bipartisan margin and in the House by a 277-148 vote that included 139 Democratic and 138 Republican votes in favor.
Obama also signed the 2013 tax law, after its passage in the Senate by unanimous consent, meaning no objections from any member of either party, and in the House with more Democrats voting in favor than Republicans.
Trump signed the 2017 tax law. Democrats did not vote for the bill in either the House or  Senate. 
In other words, Bush’s 2003 tax law and Trump’s 2017 tax law were clearly Republican-backed bills without significant Democratic support, and Bush’s 2001 tax law was substantially, although not entirely, supported by Republicans.

“DOGE subcommittee discovered $2.7 trillion in improper” Medicaid and Medicare payments to people overseas.
By Sofia Ahmed • February 18, 2025
But two of the five laws, in 2010 and 2013, were signed by Obama and supported by a broad swath of Democrats in both chambers.
The 2010 and 2013 laws related to extending tax laws that originated under Bush. 
In a statement, Murray’s office told PolitiFact that the 2010 and 2013 laws were ""technically bipartisan"" but added that ""context is badly needed.""
""Democrats did not want to extend tax cuts for the wealthiest,"" Murray’s office said in a statement. 
The negotiations for the 2010 tax bill occurred during the Great Recession, and the 2013 bill negotiations occurred before key expirations of laws, known as a ""fiscal cliff."" The looming expirations gave Republicans leverage to include higher-income taxpayers as beneficiaries of the legislation, against Democratic wishes. 
Still, many congressional Democrats, and Obama, did move to extend tax laws that originated under Bush, effectively buying into their provisions. Murray ended up voting for both the 2010 and 2013 bills, the first directly and the second by not objecting to the unanimous consent motion.
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that in general, lawmakers expressed bipartisan support for the tax bills passed since 2001 and for the stimulus bills, the annual spending increases and the Medicare expansions.
The statement from Murray’s office said, ""Democrats strongly and emphatically opposed new tax cuts for the wealthy few — the bipartisan extension of those cuts was only accomplished as a part of tough negotiations with Republicans who in 2010 held tax cuts for middle-class families hostage during an economic crisis, and in 2012 leveraged a fiscal cliff to force the extension of these tax cuts. They are tax cuts initiated and passed by Republicans—they were also tax cuts protected by Republicans during bipartisan negotiations. The Republicans, not Democrats, own the tax cuts.""
Our ruling
Murray said, ""The single biggest driver of our national debt since 2001 has been Republican tax cuts.""
A 2024 Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget analysis found that tax cuts were the biggest of four types of legislation that have added to the debt since 2001. Two other types of legislation trailed close behind in impact: large stimulus bills and annual spending increases.
However, the committee concluded that several of these tax cut bills also had Democratic buy-in from Congress or the president, or both, undercutting Murray’s assertion that Republicans acted unilaterally to pass the tax cuts. In fact, of five tax cut bills enacted since 2001, Murray ended up voting for two, the first directly and the second by not objecting to the unanimous consent motion.
We rate the statement Half True.

The rating remains unchanged.",,image_13.jpg,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/AP24072713831359/1fa8a392a0c4832836705ca708d4b5a5.jpg,Unrelated,0.2429073005914688,"The Politifact image shows a graph depicting the growth of the US national debt over time, broken down into various contributing factors.  The image itself doesn't directly address or support the claim ""The single biggest driver of our national debt since 2001 has been Republican tax cuts.""  This is why CLIP classified it as ""Unrelated"" with a low similarity score.

Here's a breakdown of why the image is insufficient to support or refute the claim:

* **Lack of Specific Attribution to Tax Cuts:** While the graph likely includes components representing the effects of government spending and tax revenue (including tax cuts), it doesn't explicitly isolate and quantify the contribution of *Republican tax cuts* as a distinct and separable factor.  The graph likely uses broader categories (e.g., ""Tax Revenue,"" ""Spending on X,"" ""Interest Payments"") which don't allow for the precise claim to be verified.  To support the claim, the graph would need to specifically show the portion of the debt increase directly attributable to Republican tax cuts, separated from other factors like increased military spending, economic downturns, or Democratic spending policies.

* **Visual Complexity and Lack of Clear Labels:** The graph's visual complexity might hinder easy interpretation.  Unless the graph has extremely clear and specific labels directly addressing the claim, determining the single largest contributor is difficult without a detailed analysis of the underlying data (which the image doesn't provide).  The lack of data points and clear labeling makes it impossible to make the quantitative comparison needed to validate the claim.

* **Time Period Discrepancy:** The claim specifies ""since 2001.""  The graph's timeframe isn't specified in the description of the image, and it's impossible to tell from the visual alone if it covers the full period from 2001 onwards.  A shorter period would not be sufficient to judge the claim's accuracy.

* **CLIP's Limitations:** CLIP, being a visual-language model, excels at identifying objects and scenes within images but struggles with nuanced data interpretation, especially within complex graphs. It lacks the analytical capabilities to extract quantitative information and verify the claim's accuracy based on the visual data presented.  It simply compares visual features and textual descriptions, finding little direct correspondence between the claim and the generic nature of the graph.

In short, the image is a general representation of national debt growth and doesn't provide the granular data needed to support or refute the claim about Republican tax cuts being the single biggest driver. The low similarity score reflects this disconnect between the claim's specificity and the image's generality.

The image is necessary to fully understand the relationship and the CLIP model's relatively low similarity score of 0.31.  Without seeing the image, a precise analysis is impossible. However, we can speculate based on the claim and the likely content of an image deemed ""related"" with a low similarity score.


The low similarity score (0.31) suggests a weak connection between the image and the claim.  The image likely doesn't contain a direct depiction of Pope Francis's death.  Here are some possibilities explaining the ""Related"" classification and low score:

* **News Headline or Article:** The image might show a newspaper headline or a news website screenshot *mentioning* Pope Francis, but not specifically his death.  Perhaps it's an article about a recent papal event, a statement from the Vatican, or general news about the Pope.  The presence of Pope Francis's image or name in the context of a news article would be enough for CLIP to establish a weak link to the claim, despite the article not reporting his death.

* **Image of Pope Francis:** The image might simply be a picture of Pope Francis, without any contextual information related to his death.  CLIP would recognize Pope Francis's face and connect it to the claim based on the shared subject, but the lack of context lowers the similarity score significantly.

* **Crowd Scene at the Vatican:**  The image could depict a crowd gathered at the Vatican, perhaps showing mourning or a large gathering.  While thematically relevant to a papal death, the absence of explicit mention or visual representation of the death event keeps the similarity low.

* **Symbolic Imagery:** The image might contain religious symbols associated with the Catholic Church, but not directly connected to the news of the Pope's death.  CLIP might connect these symbols to the claim, but again, the weak contextual link would result in a low score.


In essence, the low similarity score indicates that while the image and the claim share a common subject (Pope Francis), the image lacks strong visual evidence directly supporting the claim.  The ""Related"" classification suggests that there's some connection, but the connection is tenuous and indirect, explaining the low confidence score given by CLIP.  To provide a definitive analysis, the image itself must be examined.

The date ""February 23, 2025"" is visible, though not directly associated with the death announcement in the image itself.  The rest of the image is mostly obscured or illegible.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.32 indicates a weak positive correlation between the image and the claim ""Pope Francis died as of Feb. 23, 2025.""  The relatively low score (0.32, where 1.0 would be perfect correlation) reflects the ambiguity and lack of strong direct evidence within the image.

Here's a breakdown of why the classification is made, even with the low score:

* **Partial Confirmation:** The visible text mentions Pope Francis and his passing. While the exact wording is unclear due to the image quality and possible translation issues, the core elements are present.  The date ""February 23, 2025"" is also visible, further contributing to the association.

* **Contextual Clues:** The use of a news article screenshot on a social media platform suggests the information is being shared as news, lending credence to its potential veracity (although news reliability isn't considered by CLIP).

* **Semantic Understanding:** CLIP is capable of understanding concepts and their relationships, even with partial information.  It likely identifies keywords like ""Pope Francis,"" ""died,"" and ""February 23, 2025,"" and connects them semantically, even if the grammatical structure is obscured.

* **Low Similarity Score Explanation:** The low similarity score (0.32) reflects the several significant uncertainties:

    * **Source Reliability:** The image doesn't reveal the source of the news article, thus offering no indication of its credibility.
    * **Ambiguity:** The illegibility of parts of the text introduces uncertainty.  The headline might be misleading or taken out of context.
    * **Date Association:**  The date is not explicitly linked to the death announcement within the visible portion of the image. It's presented nearby, but a visual connection is not readily apparent.

In summary, CLIP establishes a weak link between the image and the claim based on the presence of key words and concepts. The low similarity score, however, correctly reflects the limited evidence and the inherent ambiguity within the partially obscured image. The connection is plausible but far from conclusive based solely on the visual information.  Further investigation into the source of the news article would be necessary to verify the claim.

A recent X post raises the question: What about both? 
First, a little context: Wisconsin residents will head to the polls April 1 for the next in our seemingly endless cycle of consequential elections, casting a vote for either liberal Dane County Judge Susan Crawford or conservative Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel to serve on the state Supreme Court. 
The winner will determine whether the ideological tilt of the court will remain skewed liberal, which has been the case since the election of Justice Janet Protasiewicz in 2023, or if it will return to a conservative majority, as it had been for 15 years prior. With such high stakes, experts believe the contest will produce a record-breaking level of spending, including from notable individuals and groups outside the campaigns themselves.

""To all the Milwaukee Brewers fans who live in Wisconsin: The Chicago Cubs owner is bankrolling Brad Schimel,"" the post reads. ""Vote accordingly."" 
We periodically look at claims related to politics that are circulating on social media. So, is the owner of the Cubs really bankrolling Schimel’s campaign? 
Let’s take a look. 
Big donors give money to state parties, which transfer to candidates 
We’ll get the baseball trivia out of the way first. The Ricketts family, headed by billionaire businessman Joe Ricketts, owns the Cubs. Joe’s son Tom is the team’s chairman. 
A look at Schimel’s publicly available campaign finance reports does not show the Ricketts in his list of donors. 
So what gives? The explanation requires some knowledge of campaign finance law in Wisconsin over the past decade. 
The state’s campaign finance laws cap the amount that a person can give to a Supreme Court candidate to $20,000. But under a change the Republican-controlled Wisconsin Legislature made in 2015, political parties can receive unlimited donations, which they can funnel to their preferred candidates. (That change has ultimately benefited Democrats more because they have been able to raise more money.) 
A review of the Republican Party of Wisconsin’s campaign finance reports shows a Jan. 27, 2025 donation from Joe Ricketts of $500,000. After receiving this and other large donations from wealthy individuals, Republican party officials transferred nearly $1.7 million in three donations to Schimel’s campaign. 
It’s illegal for a donor to give to the party and say they expect it to flow to a certain candidate, meaning it’s impossible to definitively prove that Ricketts’ money was for Schimel. 
Still, this practice has become a tried-and-true way for donors to get around individual contribution limits — so much so that Schimel encouraged people to do it.  
At a Calumet County Republican Party event last July, Schimel urged those who could afford to give more than $20,000 to give to the state party instead, the Journal Sentinel previously reported, suggesting any money given after the Nov. 5, 2024 election would be transferred to him.
""If you want to give a lot more, you can give that to either of the state parties, and they can transfer it,"" he said. ""They can transfer that to candidates.""

CBS News and “60 Minutes” “replaced” former Vice President Kamala Harris’ interview answers “with completely different, and far better, answers, taken from another part of the interview.”
By Sara Swann • February 7, 2025
(The Wisconsin Democracy Campaign filed an ethics complaint in early February over this remark and others by Schimel, who is prohibited by law from personally soliciting campaign donations.)
The state Democratic Party has also made use of this playbook. In January, they received $1 million from billionaire George Soros; $500,000 from Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker; $490,000 from Milwaukee philanthropist Lynde Uihlein; $470,000 from retired software engineer Gloria Page, the mother of Google co-founder Larry Page; and $250,000 from LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. Weeks after receiving those donations, they transferred $2 million in three donations to Crawford’s campaign. 
Now, for the nitty-gritty: the X post claims Ricketts is ""bankrolling"" Schimel. The dictionary definition of bankroll is ""to supply money for,"" but it’s worth noting that Ricketts is not supplying the majority of the funds in this extraordinarily expensive race. 
ABC Supply owner Diane Hendricks gave $970,000 to the state Republican party in January, and Uline president Liz Uihlein gave $650,000. Even groups backed by Elon Musk have dropped a few million on TV ads and increasing voter turnout for Schimel. 
All told, spending on this election is expected to outpace spending on Wisconsin’s last Supreme Court election in 2023, which totaled more than $56 million and shattered national spending records. 
Our ruling 
A post on social media claimed Chicago Cubs owner Joe Ricketts is bankrolling Schimel. 
A review of campaign finance records shows Ricketts gave a large sum to the state GOP, which has alongside Democrats transferred money to preferred candidates in a well-known workaround of individual contribution limits — something Schimel has acknowledged outright. 
Thus, the claim is largely accurate, though it’s missing the context of that workaround, which means we can’t know with complete certainty that Ricketts intended the money for Schimel. 
Our definition of Mostly True is a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. 
That fits here.",TRUE,image_17.jpg,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/Chicago_Cubs_logo.svg/4e57730d79b0d9dfb38af234e963044a.jpg,Related,0.2920099794864654,"The image is simply the Chicago Cubs logo.  The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.29 to the claim ""The Chicago Cubs owner is bankrolling Brad Schimel"" is weak and likely based on a superficial association.  The score itself indicates a low degree of relevance.

Here's why the connection is tenuous:

* **Only Logo, No Context:** The image contains only the visual representation of the Chicago Cubs baseball team. There's no mention of the owner, any financial dealings, or Brad Schimel.  The image provides no factual evidence to support or refute the claim.

* **Weak Semantic Connection:** The connection relies entirely on the implicit link between the Cubs logo and its owner.  CLIP likely detects the logo and associates it with the Chicago Cubs organization and, by extension, its owner.  This is a very indirect association.  There's no direct link between the Cubs organization and Brad Schimel visibly present or logically implied from the image alone.  The model likely has some knowledge base associating the Cubs with their owner, allowing for a small degree of association.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The 0.29 similarity score is crucial.  It explicitly states that the relationship is weak.  This score suggests that CLIP finds little visual or semantic overlap between the image and the claim beyond the rudimentary association of the logo with the team and its ownership.

In summary, the classification is based on a very loose, indirect connection.  The image itself offers no direct evidence related to the claim, and the low similarity score highlights the weak nature of the association.  The relationship is purely based on the knowledge that the logo represents the team, and the team has an owner.  It's a case of association by implication, not by direct evidence.  More contextual information is needed to assess the truthfulness of the claim.

The exact text is difficult to discern fully due to image quality and compression, but it clearly shows mentions of both individuals.  The context strongly suggests a discussion or news item related to Elon Musk's potential actions concerning Zelenskyy's presence on the X platform.  This is why CLIP classified the image as ""Related"" to the claim, despite a relatively low similarity score of 0.35.

Here's a breakdown of why the classification, albeit weak, makes sense:

* **Named Entities:** The most crucial factor is the presence of ""Elon Musk"" and ""Zelenskyy"" (or a clear abbreviation/reference to him) within the visible portion of the tweet.  These are key named entities directly linking the image content to the claim.  CLIP excels at recognizing and associating named entities.

* **Contextual Clues:** Even with blurry text, the overall layout suggests a social media post discussing a controversial topic. The style, font, and structure of the post are consistent with platforms like X (formerly Twitter). The overall context implies a news-related discussion, aligning with the claim's nature.

* **Low Similarity Score Explanation:** The low similarity score (0.35) likely reflects the image's quality and the inability of CLIP to definitively extract all text.  The partially obscured and low-resolution text makes accurate interpretation challenging.  A higher-resolution and clearer image would likely result in a higher similarity score.  The model isn't confident in the precise connection due to the image limitations, but the presence of the key named entities in a relevant context is enough to establish a weak but logical relationship.

In essence, CLIP identified the relevant keywords linking the image to the claim.  However, the low resolution and clarity of the image prevented a stronger correlation. The classification is more about recognizing the presence of relevant entities than a detailed semantic understanding of the tweet's content.  A better quality image would dramatically improve the similarity score and confidence in the ""Related"" classification.

It’s possible the Eagles may turn down a White House invite, if and when it’s offered, as the team and Trump, who predicted a Chiefs victory in the Super Bowl, have a history.
In 2018, Trump said he canceled a visit by the Eagles after their Super Bowl win over the New England Patriots, writing on X that ""only a small number of players decided to come."" He said it was related to Eagles players kneeling during the national anthem.
ESPN reported in 2018 that team owner Jeffrey Lurie, former head coach Doug Pederson and a handful of Eagles players were planning to attend. Most of the team’s Black players planned to skip the visit, ESPN said, quoting unnamed sources.
It’s possible the team had reached an internal decision on how to respond to a Trump White House invite, but the team has not publicly shared that. And the White House said an invitation hasn’t been sent.

The similarity score of 0.28 between the image and the claim (""The Philadelphia Eagles have declined their invitation to the White House,” as of Feb. 24.') suggests a weak but positive relationship, primarily because of the shared subject matter.  Let's break down why the relationship, while weak, exists:

* **Shared Subject:** Both the claim and the image directly mention the Philadelphia Eagles and their decision regarding a White House visit. This is the core element driving the ""Related"" classification.

* **Temporal Proximity (Implied):** While the claim specifies February 24th, the image doesn't explicitly state a date.  However, the context (a news article headline about a Super Bowl win) implies the event happened shortly after the Super Bowl, which typically occurs in early February. This temporal proximity contributes, albeit weakly, to the relationship.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The 0.28 score indicates a low degree of similarity. This is expected because the image is a visual representation of a news article, not a direct visual depiction of the Eagles declining the invitation. There's no visual representation of the actual declination event itself. The relationship is based solely on textual content within the image.

* **Lack of Visual Overlap:** The image doesn't contain visuals directly related to the claim. There are no images of Eagles players, the White House, or any explicit visual representation of a refusal. The relationship is purely driven by the textual headline.

In summary, CLIP correctly identifies a relationship because the image and the claim both discuss the same central event: the Philadelphia Eagles' decision regarding a White House visit. However, the weak similarity score accurately reflects the indirect and textual nature of the connection. The relationship is primarily based on the shared subject matter in the text of the image, not any visual elements.  The lack of precise date matching in the image also contributes to the low similarity score.

Musk said Biden had a political incentive to ""maximize"" people in the country illegally.
""That is why the Biden administration was pushing to get in as many illegals as possible and spend every dollar possible to get as many, because every one of them is a customer,"" Musk said. ""Everyone's a voter. The whole thing was a giant voter importation scam.""

Biden stepped up immigration enforcement during the election year
There were historically high levels of illegal immigration during the Biden administration, but there is no evidence that Biden ""imported"" those people to become voters. Factors such as natural disasters and economic or political turmoil in a persons’ home country lead people to migrate.
Additionally, Musk’s statement ignored that the Biden administration removed and deported immigrants in the U.S. illegally, and it stepped up efforts in 2024 as he ran for reelection. (He dropped out in July.)
The Biden administration removed, returned or expelled more than 4.5 million people from February 2021, Biden’s first full month in office, to November 2024, the latest month with available data.
Illegal immigration has generally dropped since March 2024, and it dropped significantly after June, when Biden implemented a policy limiting people’s ability to apply for asylum at the southwest border. For example, there were more than 137,000 southwest border encounters in March 2024 and 47,000 in December. 
""Biden was trying to deport as many border crossers as he could, so I don’t see any evidence he wanted these people in the United States,"" said David Bier, an immigration expert at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""He campaigned as being anti-illegal immigration. He never courted their votes, and he could not court their votes because they cannot vote and do not vote. Saying ‘every one of them was a voter’ is as divorced from reality as anything you could possibly say.""
It takes several years for immigrants to become citizens
Federal law requires U.S. citizenship to vote in national elections, and would-be voters sign a form that attests under penalty of perjury that they are citizens when they register to vote. 
The citizenship process takes several years. 
""It takes on average five years in green card status before a person can become a U.S. citizen, so no one would instantly gain the right to vote,"" Michelle Mittelstadt, a spokesperson for the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, previously told PolitiFact.
Musk acknowledged at CPAC that it might take years for immigrants to gain citizenship, but it would be ""an investment that is guaranteed to pay off.""
Immigrants who arrive illegally have higher hurdles to clear before becoming citizens and voting. The Biden administration failed in its efforts to pass a law with a pathway to citizenship, and no such legislation is expected during the Trump administration.
Which party would have the ‘immigrant’ advantage?
There is no guarantee that immigrants who become citizens will vote, or vote for Democrats. Although the southwest border gets the most attention, immigrants who come illegally are not from Latin America only.
Mike Madrid, a Republican strategist in California and author of the book ""The Latino Century,"" said Republicans won the largest national Hispanic vote share in 2024 than in presidential elections in recent cycles.

By Samantha Putterman • January 24, 2025
Immigrants, including Hispanics, view the Republican Party as focused on economic issues and the Democratic Party as focused on cultural issues, Madrid said.
The New York Times documented a conservative shift among immigrants after the 2020 election. Its analysis of voting in 28,000 precincts in more than 20 cities found that immigrant-dense neighborhoods with large populations of Latinos and residents of Asian descent had a surge in turnout and shifted to the right. 
""There is zero evidence that immigration has harmed Republican Party prospects,"" Bier previously told us. 
Eligible naturalized citizens comprise about 10% of voters, Pew Research Center found in 2024. 
Voting by noncitizens is rare
There are incidents of noncitizens voting in elections, but they are sporadic among millions of votes cast in federal elections. Immigrants who cross the border illegally are typically looking for jobs and many are escaping poverty or crime — most don’t want to risk drawing government authorities’ attention by casting a ballot.
Voting by noncitizens carries high risks that include deportation if they are here illegally or incarceration. Fraudulent voter registration or voting by noncitizens often results from misunderstandings or errors. For example, some noncitizens accidentally register to vote when applying for a driver’s license.
Our ruling
Musk said Biden’s immigration policy was ""a giant voter importation scam.""
There is no evidence that the Biden administration was bringing in people illegally to cast votes. Government data shows more than 4.5 million removals, returns and expulsions during Biden’s tenure. Biden stepped up these actions during the election year.
It takes several years for immigrants to become citizens and therefore eligible to vote. Immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally cannot vote and would have to overcome hurdles to become citizens.

This claim is entirely absent from the image itself.  The image simply shows Biden; it offers no evidence or context to support or refute the claim.

CLIP's classification of 'Unrelated' with a similarity score of 0.24 is therefore justified.

The image provides no visual representation of immigration policy, voter fraud, or any evidence suggesting a link between the two.

* **Shared Semantic Theme:** Both the claim and the image relate to the theme of political protest and dissent. The claim describes protestors as ""spoiled crybabies,"" while the image depicts people engaging in protest activity. This shared theme is the basis of the relationship.

* **Conceptual Link:** The image shows individuals expressing their opinions through a protest. Musk's statement criticizes protestors, framing them negatively.  CLIP connects these elements conceptually, even if there's no explicit mention of Musk or the specific protest in the image.

* **Low Score Explanation:** The low similarity score (0.30) reflects the indirect nature of the relationship.  There's no textual overlap or visual representation of Elon Musk or his quote within the image.

Mace’s office did not respond to a request for comment before publication. After publication, her office wrote in a Feb. 21 email, ""Barring chromosomal abnormalities, a person with a typical number of chromosomes — known as a euploid — has either XX or XY which determines biological sex.""
About 1.7% of the worldwide population has intersex conditions or differences in sex development — cases in which someone’s anatomy does not fit into male or female — according to a commonly cited review of medical literature published in 2000 by Brown University biologist Anne Fausto-Sterling. 
The conditions include: 
Klinefelter Syndrome (XXY): People with this condition, first identified in 1942, have an extra X chromosome. People with this syndrome are typically assigned male at birth; the condition can result in infertility, low testosterone and undescended testicles. It occurs in about 1 in 600 males. 
Turner Syndrome (missing or partial X): First identified in 1938, this syndrome occurs when a female is missing part of the X chromosome pair. This can cause short stature, delayed puberty, low sex hormones and possible infertility. 
Triple X Syndrome (XXX): The symptoms of this syndrome, also called trisomy X, can vary from mild — tall height — to more severe, including developmental delays. The condition, present in about 1 in 1,000 females, was first identified in 1959. 
Jacob’s Syndrome (XYY): A relatively rare condition with mild symptoms, males with this syndrome are born with an extra Y chromosome. It occurs in about 1 in 1000 males and was identified in the 1960s. 
According to a factsheet released by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, chromosomal variations ""occur in an estimated 1 in 1,500 to 1 in 2,000 live births, which amounts to approximately 200,000 to 330,000 Americans based on the current population.""

There are also intersex conditions that do not involve chromosomes because a person’s ""sex,"" according to scientists, is not easily measured by one factor. Chromosomes, gonads, hormones and genitalia can all contribute to a person’s sex categorization.
People born with de la Chapelle syndrome have XX chromosomes but can develop a penis, because a gene typically found on the Y chromosome gets moved to a new position on the X chromosome.
People with androgen insensitivity syndrome have male chromosomes, but don’t respond to their body’s naturally produced male hormones, ranging from mild to complete insensitivity. In cases of complete insensitivity, genetically male fetuses (XY), with internal testes and normal testosterone production could develop vaginas and be assigned female at birth. Partial and mild insensitivity can result in more ambiguous sex characteristics. 
Other conditions also result in ambiguous genitalia that do not fall neatly into a male or female sex category.
""A lot of other variations might be noticeable at birth if they cause other types of genital differences,"" Sylvan Fraser Anthony, legal and policy director at Interact, a nonprofit advocating for intersex youth, told PolitiFact. ""Others will be discovered, you know, not until later.""
Our ruling
Mace wrote on X, ""You either have XX or XY chromosomes. Those are the options.""

Although most people are born with either XX or XY chromosomes, science dating back decades shows some people are born with other chromosomal variations.

Those are the options"" presents a simplified view of sex determination, ignoring variations in sex chromosomes and intersex conditions.  The image from Politifact shows a diverse group of people, likely representing a variety of genders and identities. This visual diversity directly contradicts the simplistic binary presented in the claim.

The CLIP model's classification of ""Unrelated"" with a low similarity score of 0.23 is entirely justified because the image and the claim depict fundamentally different concepts:

* **The claim:** Focuses on a purely biological, binary model of sex determination. It is a reductionist statement that ignores the complexities of sex and gender.

* **The image:** Depicts the social reality of human diversity, showcasing individuals who likely represent a range of gender identities and expressions.  It's a visual representation of the spectrum of human experience, not a biological diagram of chromosomes.

Therefore, the low similarity score reflects the lack of conceptual overlap.  The image doesn't illustrate or support the claim; rather, it implicitly challenges it by demonstrating the existence of individuals whose experiences fall outside the strict XX/XY binary.  The image's purpose is likely to highlight the limitations and inaccuracy of such a binary view of sex.  There's no visual representation of chromosomes, karyotypes, or any biological data directly related to the claim. The image’s focus is on people, not their genetics.  The model correctly identifies this disconnect.

This low score indicates that the image likely does *not* definitively show Jonathan Simpson, the pilot involved in a Delta crash in Toronto.  Let's analyze why CLIP might have given this weak positive classification:

The image itself (from the archived URL) needs to be described since I cannot directly access and process external URLs.  Assuming it's a photograph, the reasons for the ""Related"" classification with a low score could be due to one or more of the following:

* **Presence of a Pilot:** The image might contain a person in a pilot's uniform or a setting suggestive of an aviation environment (e.g., an airplane cockpit, airport terminal). This would contribute to the ""Related"" classification, even if the person is not Jonathan Simpson. The uniform's resemblance to a Delta pilot's uniform could further strengthen the weak connection.  However, the lack of clear identification markers (name tags, etc.) severely limits the confidence.

* **Generic Aviation Context:** The image might depict a scene related to aviation – perhaps a news report about an air crash (not necessarily the Delta crash in Toronto) or a generic image related to air travel. This would provide a tenuous link to the claim, leading to a low similarity score because the connection is indirect and general.

* **Textual Clues (if present):** If the image contains any text mentioning ""Delta,"" ""Toronto,"" or ""crash,"" even in a tangential context, it would contribute to CLIP's association. However, the lack of specific mention of Jonathan Simpson is crucial.

* **Facial Similarity (Unlikely at 0.34):** While CLIP can assess facial similarity, a score of 0.34 is far too low to suggest a strong resemblance between the image's subject and Jonathan Simpson.  This level of similarity could be purely coincidental.

**In Summary:**

The low similarity score strongly suggests the image does *not* convincingly depict Jonathan Simpson.  CLIP's ""Related"" classification is likely based on the image containing elements loosely related to the claim's keywords – aviation, Delta, and potentially Toronto – but lacks concrete evidence to link the image directly to Jonathan Simpson.  The weak association arises from a combination of contextual clues, rather than a direct visual match.  To trust the image as evidence for the claim, significantly more corroborating information would be necessary.

Musk has not issued such a policy. We searched news reports and Musk’s X account and found no evidence that he directed all federal workers to undergo drug screening. The claim likely originated as a misinterpretation of Musk’s response to a Feb.1 X post by Joshua Steinman, who served as a cybersecurity adviser to Trump during his first term. 
Steinman called on the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, an advisory group tasked with slashing government spending that’s associated with Musk, to implement a policy of mandatory drug tests for all federal workers. Musk responded: ""Great idea.""
Although Musk’s comment suggests he may support such a policy, he has not issued a drug-testing directive for federal workers. Some social media users pointed out Musk’s own public drug use, including smoking cannabis during a 2018 live podcast.

It’s also doubtful Musk could give such an order. Although Musk has become the unofficial head of DOGE, the White House clarified Feb. 17 in court filings that he has no official role with the department and described him as a senior adviser to the president. ""Like other senior White House advisors, Mr. Musk has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself,"" the federal court filing said. ""Mr. Musk can only advise the President and communicate the President's directives.""
Regardless, a drug testing policy for federal employees has existed since at least 1986 when President Ronald Regan instituted it by executive order. The federal government can drug test workers as a condition for hiring, through random selection or based on a reasonable suspicion of drug use that includes cocaine and methamphetamine. And although 24 states and the District of Columbia permit recreational cannabis, the U.S. government tests for marijuana because it’s still federally banned. 
Refusing to take a drug test or finding drugs in a federal employee’s sample could lead to a range of actions, including firing. In 2023, the Department of Health and Human Services estimated that federal agencies collect roughly 275,000 urine samples annually.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.33 indicates a weak connection.  This low score suggests the relationship is tenuous.

Here's why the connection is weak, despite the presence of Elon Musk:

* **Lack of Direct Evidence:** The image solely depicts Elon Musk.  There's no visual evidence linking him to a federal drug-testing mandate or any associated documentation. The image is a single, generic picture of him, offering no context related to the claim.

* **Contextual Dissonance:** The claim asserts a specific action (federal worker drug testing) by Elon Musk, which is highly unlikely given the structure of the US government.  Elon Musk does not have the authority to issue such a mandate.  The image, devoid of any context suggesting such authority, further weakens the connection.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The score of 0.33 signifies a very weak association. CLIP likely found the relationship solely based on the presence of Elon Musk in the image and his mention in the claim.  This is a superficial connection, lacking substantial evidence of the claim's validity within the image itself.

In short, the CLIP model's classification is based on the simple fact that the claim mentions Elon Musk, and the image contains Elon Musk.  However, the lack of contextual information in the image to support the claim, coupled with the inherent implausibility of the claim, results in a low similarity score and a weak, almost irrelevant, connection.  The model's classification is primarily due to surface-level feature matching, rather than a semantic understanding of the claim's implications.

stated on February 18, 2025 in remarks to reporters at Mar-a-Lago:",Volodymyr Zelenskyy “started” the war in Ukraine with Russia.,"stated on February 18, 2025 in remarks to reporters at Mar-a-Lago:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/feb/19/donald-trump/did-ukraine-start-its-war-with-russia-as-president/,,"As the three-year anniversary of Russia's Ukraine invasion neared, President Donald Trump offered a false version of history.
U.S. and Russian representatives held talks in Saudi Arabia that included discussion of how to end the war in Ukraine, and Trump dismissed complaints that Ukrainian officials were not invited to participate.
""I think I have the power to end this war, and I think it's going very well,"" Trump said while answering reporters’ questions Feb. 18 at his Mar-a-Lago resort. ""But today I heard (from Ukraine), ‘Oh well, we weren't invited.’ Well, you've been there for three years. You should have ended it three years — you should have never started it, you could have made a deal.""
This clashes with the evidence that Russia sent a large invasion force into Ukraine in February 2022.
The notion that Ukraine ""started it"" — that the country is to blame for an invasion that has killed an estimated 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers and at least 12,000 Ukrainian civilians — sparked outrage in Ukraine and from its allies. 
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded that Trump ""lives in this disinformation space.""
Trump’s former vice president, Mike Pence, posted Feb. 19 on X, ""Mr. President, Ukraine did not ‘start’ this war. Russia launched an unprovoked and brutal invasion claiming hundreds of thousands of lives. The Road to Peace must be built on the Truth.""
After Zelenskyy’s comments, Trump piled on more attacks on Truth Social, claiming the Ukrainian president ""is very low in Ukrainian Polls"" and is ""a Dictator without Elections.""
In a Kyiv International Institute of Sociology poll conducted Feb. 4 to 9, Zelenskyy had a 57% trust rating among Ukrainians surveyed. That’s down from 90% in May 2022, shortly after Russia’s invasion, but up from 52% in December 2024. Ukrainian law bans parliamentary and presidential elections during a state of martial law, which currently exists. Zelenskyy has promised elections once martial law is lifted. 
We asked the White House for evidence that Ukraine had started the war and received no response.
Russia’s attempt to blame Ukraine is part of a longstanding argument that doesn’t stand up to scrutiny.
What happened in February 2022
As people were sleeping, Russian troops and tanks rolled into Ukraine and missiles poured down in what U.S. military analysts called the largest military operation in Europe since World War II. The attack followed weeks of Russian maneuvers that included staging a large-scale military exercise along Russia’s border with Ukraine that the U.S. estimated to include 190,000 Russian troops. 
News coverage, video footage and the United Nations noted Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in real time. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced it as a ""special military operation"" at 6 a.m. Moscow time Feb. 24, 2022.
""The purpose of this operation is to protect people who, for eight years now, have been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kiev regime,"" Putin said in a televised address, using the Russian spelling of Ukraine’s capital city. ""To this end, we will seek to demilitarize and denazify Ukraine, as well as bring to trial those who perpetrated numerous bloody crimes against civilians, including against citizens of the Russian Federation.""
About 500 miles and a time zone away, residents of Kyiv awoke to the sounds of explosions. In the small eastern city of Sloviansk in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, loud booms drove people from their beds in panic. Families packed belongings, swarmed ATMs and gas stations, and tried to flee the Russian invasion in cars, trains, planes and on foot.
How did the false talking point that Ukraine started the war begin?
To set the stage for the invasion, Putin had long denied Ukraine was even a country, falsely characterizing its history and culture, arguing the Ukrainians were simply Russians who needed to be brought back into the fold. 
PolitiFact recognized Putin’s lies justifying the Ukraine war as our 2022 Lie of the Year.
In 1990, Ukraine's parliament declared its independence from the Soviet Union, a call it repeated in August 1991. Ukraine gained its independence four months later. In December 1991, Ukrainians voted overwhelmingly for independence, and within days, the USSR dissolved. In 1994, Ukraine agreed with the U.S., the United Kingdom and Russia to exchange its nuclear arsenal, the world's third-largest, for security guarantees.
But the rush of post-Soviet history grated on Putin, analysts say.
Putin has served as Russia’s top leader since 1999, with a four-year period in which he was nominally No. 2 but was widely considered the country’s ultimate center of power.
He has long sought to establish the theoretical foundations for escalating the war in Ukraine, a country with about one-third the population of Russia and, before the war, about one-ninth the gross domestic product.
As early as 2008, Putin told then-President George W. Bush that ""Ukraine is not a country."" Since then, Putin has asserted that there is no such thing as a Ukrainian people separate from Russia.

""These claims were designed to deny the existence and agency of the Ukrainian nation,"" Erik Herron, a West Virginia University political scientist and author of the book ""Elections and Democracy after Communism,"" told PolitiFact in 2022.
Yet, the history of Ukraine has involved several empires or states, some of which were entirely separate from Russia, Eugene Finkel, an associate professor with Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies, told PolitiFact on the eve of the war.
Putin set the table for the 2022 invasion with a 5,000-word essay in July 2021. In it, he argued that much of modern-day Ukraine occupies historically Russian lands and that ""Russia was robbed"" of them.
Putin’s essay blamed the conflict on the West, claiming that the protest-driven ouster of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych in 2014, an ally of Russia, was engineered from the outside, and that the Ukrainian government elected in 2014 is illegitimate. 
Putin’s argument was that Ukraine was poised ""to join NATO and have NATO missiles placed in Ukraine and aimed at Russia,"" said Alexander Motyl, a Rutgers University-Newark political scientist. In Putin’s telling, ""Poor Russia was forced to rush to the persecuted Ukrainians' defense and forestall NATO-inspired Ukranian aggression,"" Motyl said.
In 2023, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev echoed Putin’s stance, saying that Ukraine is a part of Russia, but ""we live in different apartments.""
Soon after the war started, more than 140 scholars signed a letter denouncing Putin’s narrative as ""factually wrong, morally repugnant and deeply offensive to the memory of millions of victims of Nazism and those who courageously fought against it, including Russian and Ukrainian soldiers of the Red Army.""
As for Trump’s recent remark, it is a ""distillation of these Russian talking points,"" Herron said.

Trump said  Zelenskyy ""started"" the war in Ukraine with Russia.
On Feb. 24, 2022, Russian forces launched an invasion on Ukraine, a country that the night before was at peace. Putin called it a ""special military operation"" and he premised the attack on false claims about Ukraine. As people were sleeping, Russian troops and tanks rolled into Ukraine and missiles poured down in what U.S. military analysts called the largest military operation in Europe since World War II.

Here's why the connection is weak and why the model might have still classified it as ""Related"":

* **Zelenskyy's Presence:** The image prominently features Zelenskyy, the key figure in the claim. This is the primary reason for any perceived relationship.  The claim directly names him as a central actor.

* **Absence of Causal Evidence:** The image offers no evidence supporting the claim that Zelenskyy *started* the war.  The photo depicts a speech, which could be interpreted in various ways, from rallying support to addressing the conflict's consequences.  It doesn't show him initiating any hostile action.

* **Contextual Ambiguity:** The lack of surrounding information makes interpretation difficult. The setting might be before, during, or after the start of the war. Without context, the image is inconclusive regarding Zelenskyy's role in the conflict's initiation.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The 0.27 score indicates a low degree of semantic similarity. CLIP likely made the connection based solely on Zelenskyy's presence, not any direct visual evidence supporting the claim's narrative.  Higher scores would suggest a stronger link, perhaps if the image showed Zelenskyy engaged in a clearly provocative act.

In summary, the ""Related"" classification is based on the presence of Zelenskyy, the central figure in the claim.  However, the image itself provides no visual evidence to support the assertion that he started the war. The low similarity score accurately reflects the weak and indirect nature of the connection.

"Susan Crawford
stated on February 9, 2025 in TV interview:",Wisconsin does not “require judges to automatically recuse just because they have done some kind of legal work in the past as a lawyer.”,"stated on February 9, 2025 in TV interview:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/feb/19/susan-crawford/candidate-right-that-wisconsin-does-not-require-ju/,,"As the race for control of Wisconsin’s Supreme Court picks up steam, there’s a word you’ve probably heard: Recusal. 
Recusal refers to a justice’s decision to sit out a case because they have a connection to the lawsuit or lawyers that affects their ability to rule fairly. 
Dane County Court Judge Susan Crawford, the liberal candidate in the race, was asked by WISN-TV’s ""Upfront"" during its Feb. 9, 2025 episode if she should recuse herself from any case before the Supreme Court involving abortion. 
Crawford, as a private attorney, represented Planned Parenthood in challenging a state law that required physicians providing abortion services to get admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.
""The law does not require judges to automatically recuse just because they have done some kind of legal work in the past as a lawyer,"" Crawford said.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
Crawford’s involvement in the case happened about a decade ago: A federal appeals court panel found the law unconstitutional in 2015. 
Because recusal is bound to come up in the remaining weeks of campaigning, let’s take a look at what the standards are in Wisconsin. Legal experts will also explain why there are often gray areas.
Code of conduct requires recusal if justice served as a lawyer in the specific lawsuit
Let’s start with laying out what the Code of Judicial Conduct says about recusal, and if it mentions anything about stepping away because of previous work as a lawyer.
Here are just a few of the situations where the code says a justice should recuse. 
The judge was a material witness in the case.
The judge, their spouse or minor children have an economic interest in the case.
The judge’s spouse or relative is a lawyer in the case. 
But there’s another one that relates to Crawford’s claim: ""The judge served as a lawyer in the matter in controversy.""
Wait — does ""matter in controversy"" mean Crawford would be disqualified from participating in anything related to abortion?
That’s not the case, explained Charles Geyh, a professor at the Indiana University Maurer School of Law who specializes in judicial ethics. The ""matter"" refers to a specific lawsuit, not a broad issue. 
""You can certainly see where if you expanded it to include the issue, that would get crazy pretty quickly. Lawyers who are active litigators may be addressing bazillions of issue areas,"" Geyh said. 
Howard Schweber, a professor emeritus of political science and legal studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, noted many judges previously worked as criminal prosecutors or defenders.
""It would be absurd to suggest that those judges must recuse themselves from any case involving a crime,"" Schweber said. 
Recusal decisions exist on a spectrum, can lead to some grey areas
But sometimes it’s not quite so straightforward. Schweber sees recusal decisions as a spectrum. 
At the most obvious end is recusing because you’d make money if you rule a certain way. At the other end is recusing because of a philosophical belief you have. 
If a justice worked for Planned Parenthood on the particular issue in a lawsuit now before the Supreme Court, recusal would be appropriate, Schweber said. But simply working for Planned Parenthood is less so. 
""It’s unfortunately really quite difficult to be much more specific than that, because there’s an element of judgment involved,"" Schweber said. 
Crawford’s campaign provided much of the same background when PolitiFact Wisconsin reached out, citing a report on recusal from the State Democracy Research Initiative at UW’s Law School.
""Notably, Judge Crawford’s representation of Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin was not the same action that is now before the court. Recusal is not required simply for having represented a party in previous actions,"" her campaign said.
For context, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin has asked the Supreme Court to recognize a constitutional right to bodily autonomy, including abortion.
Schweber said working on a particular issue like the constitutionality of Act 10 would be a stronger case for recusal. ""It’s further down that spectrum of possibilities,"" Schweber said.  
Another way to look at the spectrum: Conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn recused from the current Act 10 case because he helped create the law and defended it as former Gov. Scott Walker’s chief legal counsel.
Crawford also addressed Act 10 in the interview — she represented teachers challenging the law. Crawford said she’d consider the parties bringing the lawsuit and which part of Act 10 is being litigated.

“Melania wins $900 million ‘defamation lawsuit’ against The View & Sunny Hostin.”
By Sofia Ahmed • February 4, 2025
Justices themselves ultimately decide whether to recuse, some have called for stricter rules
That gets into a second major idea that supports Crawford’s claim.
In Wisconsin, Supreme Court justices decide for themselves if they’d be biased on a certain issue and if they should recuse. The other justices can’t overrule their decision.
So, it would be up to Crawford to make the final call about whether to step away from a case involving a group she represented or an issue she worked on in the past.
""If you work for Planned Parenthood, you can assume that you’re not hostile to the goals of Planned Parenthood,"" Geyh said.
""But even then, there is no rule that says once you stop doing that and you put on your judicial hat, that you are somehow compromised in your ability to be fair and impartial,"" he said.
Because justices rule on their own bias, some have called for stricter standards. Geyh is on board with that idea but cautioned that partisan interests could ""manufacture"" new rules to get a justice off a case.
Crawford and her conservative opponent, Waukesha County Court Judge Brad Schimel, were asked by WISN if they would back imposing recusal rules for the Supreme Court.
Schimel said he would want to see what the rules would be before deciding whether to support them. 
Crawford said she thinks the current judicial code is a ""workable system, but I also welcome any opportunities to strengthen and improve a system like that.""
Our ruling
Crawford said Wisconsin does not ""require judges to automatically recuse just because they have done some kind of legal work in the past as a lawyer.""
Legal experts interviewed by PolitiFact Wisconsin agreed — it would be a slippery slope if justices weren’t allowed to participate in cases that broadly relate to their past work. 
The judicial code requires recusal if the justice worked as a lawyer in the ""matter in controversy."" That refers to a particular lawsuit, not a broad issue like abortion. But there can be gray areas.
Ultimately, it’s up to Crawford to determine whether she’d be impartial in a case, the same as any other justice on the bench.

The claim, ""Wisconsin does not ‘require judges to automatically recuse just because they have done some kind of legal work in the past as a lawyer,’"" is about judicial recusal policies within Wisconsin's judicial system.

The CLIP model likely classified the image as ""Unrelated"" with a low similarity score (0.21) because the image itself provides no direct visual evidence related to the claim.  The photo is a simple exterior shot of a building. There's nothing in the image depicting:

* **Legal work:** No documents, legal briefs, or symbols related to past legal work are visible.
* **Recusal processes:** There's no visual representation of court proceedings, discussions about recusal, or any indication of the inner workings of the court's decision-making processes.
* **Specific judges:** The image doesn't show any individuals, let alone specific judges who might have faced a recusal issue.
* **Textual evidence:** The image lacks any text related to the claim about recusal policies in Wisconsin.


Essentially, the image is a generic picture of a building. While the building is the Wisconsin Supreme Court, the visual information doesn't connect in any meaningful way to the specific assertion about the state's recusal rules for its judges. The claim requires contextual understanding of Wisconsin's judicial code and practices; the image offers only a visual representation of the physical location of the court, lacking the necessary semantic information to support or refute the claim. Therefore, the low similarity score and ""Unrelated"" classification are justifiable.

Data show: 
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
The federal civilian workforce increased by 4.8% during Biden’s term — not by almost 50%.
There were about 2.89 million federal employees when Biden took office, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics — not 2.1 million.
When Biden left office, there were about 3.02 million federal employees, Bureau of Labor Statistics figures show. The count included about 600,000 postal workers who were not paid by taxpayer dollars because the U.S. Postal Service is generally self-funded. It also included congressional staffers and other employees outside the executive branch. It excludes the military’s 1.3 million active-duty uniformed service members, who are generally not counted among federal employees.
President Donald Trump oversaw a modest increase in federal government hiring during his first term, with a 2.6% increase in the federal workforce. There were about 2.81 million federal workers when Trump entered office in January 2017, and 2.89 million when he left in January 2021. 
Since 2000, the number of federal government workers has increased by 9.2%, largely staying between 2.7 million and 2.8 million until the count surpassed 3 million during Biden’s term. The number of employees briefly spiked every 10 years during the decennial censuses. 
And the numbers have been higher: From 1985 to 1994, under both Republican and Democratic administrations, there were more than 3 million federal employees. The number dropped by 11% during President Bill Clinton’s tenure as he implemented measures to streamline the federal workforce. 
It’s unclear where the incorrect 2.1 million figure came from.
The Office of Personnel Management provides detailed information on executive branch employees, which excludes postal workers, congressional staffers and intelligence agency workers. The number of people working in the executive branch was at around 2.17 million in December 2020, shortly before Biden took office. The number grew by about 5.5%, to 2.29 million in May 2024, the most recent month available.

During a similar window of Trump’s first term, from December 2016 to June 2020, the number of executive branch workers increased by about 3.2%.
Biden increased hiring at most federal agencies
Biden increased hiring in all but two Cabinet-level agencies, as well as at most independent agencies.
The departments that saw biggest personnel increases during Biden’s term were the State, Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs, Treasury and Energy departments, Government Executive reported in January. 
The Defense and Commerce departments lost workers.
Although federal employment ticked up during Trump’s first term, he cut staff at most federal agencies. Employment increased at the Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs and the Defense Department, offsetting cuts elsewhere in the executive branch, Government Executive reported. The Education, State and Labor departments saw the biggest employment cuts, all shrinking more than 10%. 
Trump has made slashing the federal workforce a top priority of his first month back in office. Trump’s administration terminated thousands of employees on probationary status Feb. 13, a day after a federal judge greenlit a buyout offer that the White House said 77,000 employees had accepted before it closed. Labor unions sued the Trump administration over the probationary employee firings. 
Our ruling
A social media post said the federal workforce ""was at 2.1 million"" when Biden took office and ""had increased to 3 million"" by the time he left.
The federal workforce grew by about 4.8% during Biden’s term, increasing from 2.89 million in January 2021 to 3.02 million in January 2025. Measuring just executive branch employees, the count increased by about 5.5%, from 2.17 million to 2.29 million.

The connection between the image and the claim ""The federal workforce grew from 2.1 to 3 million under President Joe Biden, “a 46% increase since Biden took office,” is tenuous at best, explaining the relatively low similarity score of 0.30 from CLIP.

Here's a breakdown of why the relationship is weak:

* **Lack of Direct Evidence:** The image shows Biden speaking; there's no visible mention of federal workforce numbers, hiring policies, or any data related to the claim.  The image provides no direct visual evidence to support or refute the statement about federal workforce growth.

* **Indirect Association:** The only connection is the presence of President Biden.  The claim relates to an action (or inaction) taken during his presidency.  CLIP might have established a weak link based on this association, understanding that Biden's presidency is contextually relevant to the claim. However, this connection is extremely indirect and lacks any concrete visual support.

* **Contextual Ambiguity:** The image lacks context surrounding the speech's content.  The speech *could* have touched upon government staffing, but there's no way to know from the image alone.  The absence of textual information about the speech's topic severely limits the relevance.

* **CLIP's Limitations:** CLIP excels at identifying visual objects and concepts but struggles with nuanced relationships between images and textual claims, especially those requiring complex reasoning or understanding of political processes.  The low similarity score reflects this limitation; it detected a loose association between Biden (present in the image) and the claim regarding his presidency, but didn't find any direct visual proof within the image.


In summary, the ""Related"" classification with a low score (0.30) reflects CLIP's identification of a very weak, purely contextual link based on the presence of President Biden in an image unrelated to the specifics of the claim about federal workforce growth.  The image provides no supporting visual evidence for the claim.  The low score appropriately reflects this lack of concrete connection.

""The @DOGE team just discovered that FEMA sent $59M LAST WEEK to luxury hotels in New York City to house illegal migrants. Sending this money violated the law and is in gross insubordination to the President’s executive order,"" Musk said Feb. 10 in an X post. ""That money is meant for American disaster relief and instead is being spent on high end hotels for illegals! A clawback demand will be made today to recoup those funds.""
During the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump made a similar claim after Hurricane Helene hit the southeast U.S. in late September.
""$1 billion was stolen from FEMA to use it for illegal migrants,"" Trump said at the time. We rated that claim Pants on Fire! 
Like Trump’s, Musk’s claim is inaccurate. FEMA did not give money directly to New York hotels; it did give money to New York City. That move was neither illegal nor secretive. It was part of a program that Congress created and funded using money from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, not FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund, which is primarily used after natural disasters. The money did not fund luxury hotel rooms for immigrants.

Here are the facts.
FEMA has funded states and organizations that help migrants since Trump’s first term
Since Trump’s first administration, FEMA has given money to help state and local governments and nonprofit organizations that provide immigrants with basic services.
In 2019, as illegal immigration increased, Congress gave FEMA funding to expand its Emergency Food and Shelter Program to include migrant support services to immigrants  awaiting court proceedings. The program previously had been used only for people facing homelessness and hunger. 
In 2023, Congress directed U.S. Customs and Border Protection and FEMA to create the Shelter and Services Program for migrants, removing immigration grants from the Emergency Food and Shelter Program. The Shelter and Services Program uses money Congress has given Customs and Border Protection, and is administered by FEMA.
In fiscal year 2024, which started October 2023 and ended September 2024, Congress directed U.S. Customs and Border Protection to give FEMA $650 million for the Shelter and Services Program. 
Neither program was, or is, funded with money promised to FEMA’s disaster relief work. 
""The Disaster Relief Fund has nothing to do with any migrant assistance account because all that spending is from separate funds,"" Joshua Sewell, a federal budget expert at the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense, told PolitiFact in October 2024.
During Trump’s first administration, he shifted $271 million in FEMA funding, including about $155 million from the Disaster Relief Fund, to address immigration.
New York City received about $59 million from FEMA, spent $19 million on hotels
Musk did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for evidence that FEMA sent New York City $59 million ""last week."" 
FEMA’s Shelter and Services Program website shows how much money state and local governments and nonprofit organizations have received from the program. However, the data is only updated through fiscal year 2024. In 2024, New York City’s Office of Management and Budget received $59 million.

By Samantha Putterman • January 21, 2025
The New York City’s mayor office told The Associated Press Feb. 10 that it received $81 million from the federal government the week of Feb. 3 in two payments — one for $59 million, $19 million of which went to direct hotel costs. The mayor’s office did not respond to our request for comment.
""This morning, my financial team shockingly uncovered that President Trump and his crony Elon Musk illegally executed a revocation of $80 million in congressionally-appropriated FEMA funding from New York City’s bank accounts late yesterday afternoon,"" Brad Lander, New York City’s comptroller said in a statement posted to the agency’s website. ""This is money that the federal government previously disbursed for shelter and services and is now missing. This highway robbery of our funds directly out of our bank account is a betrayal of everyone who calls New York City home."" 
New York City law requires the government to provide shelter to people who need it. According to a July 2024 comptroller report, the city spent an average of $156 dollars per night per hotel room. 
According to FEMA’s list of allowable expenses for the shelter program, hotel room costs ""should be reasonable based on the rate set by the U.S. General Services Administration.""
The U.S. General Services Administration sets the per diem rates for New York City hotel rooms at between $179 and $342 per night, depending on the month. Luxury, five-star hotels in New York City cost around $400 to $1,000 a night, according to a search on Expedia, a travel booking site.
Our ruling
Musk said ""The @DOGE team just discovered that FEMA sent $59M LAST WEEK to luxury hotels in New York City to house illegal migrants … That money is meant for American disaster relief.""
FEMA awarded New York City $59 million in fiscal year 2024. The money is part of a program that Congress approved to reimburse local and state governments and nonprofit organizations that provide basic services to immigrants. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection funds the program and FEMA manages it. None of the money comes from FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund, which is primarily used after natural disasters. 
New York City does not house migrants in luxury hotel rooms. In 2024, it spent an average of $156 dollars per night per hotel room, below the General Services Administration’s per diem rate. The city spent $19 million on hotel rooms.

The image itself contains no explicit mention of $59 million, luxury hotels in New York City, illegal migrants, or American disaster relief.  The focus is on a single individual in an official context.  There is no visual evidence linking this FEMA representative or the implied event to the specific claim about funding for migrant housing.

The CLIP model's ""Unrelated"" classification with a similarity score of 0.23 is entirely justified because:

* **Lack of Contextual Connection:** The image shows a generic scene involving a FEMA official.  It provides no specific information that corroborates or refutes the claim about the $59 million in funding.  The image is visually unrelated to the core components of the claim (money, hotels, migrants, disaster relief).

* **Abstract Nature of the Claim:** The claim itself involves financial transactions and policy decisions.  These are abstract concepts that are difficult to visually represent.  Images rarely directly depict monetary transfers or bureaucratic processes.

* **Low Visual Overlap:** There is no visual overlap between the image and the claim's components.  There are no visible signs of luxury hotels, migrants, or disaster damage.  Even the presence of a FEMA representative is not enough to establish a connection, as FEMA has many responsibilities beyond disaster relief.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The 0.23 similarity score reflects the minimal visual overlap between the image and the semantic content of the claim.  A score closer to 1.0 would indicate a strong visual match.

In essence, the image is a generic picture of a FEMA representative, while the claim makes a specific and detailed allegation about FEMA's financial activities.  The two are only tenuously related through the mention of FEMA.  The lack of concrete visual evidence supporting the claim leads to the appropriate ""Unrelated"" classification.  The low similarity score quantifies this lack of visual connection.

Now, they are scrutinizing the wealth of the agency’s former leader.
In a Feb. 11 Oval Office press availability, Trump asked Musk, ""Can you mention some of the things that your team has found, some of the crazy numbers, including the woman that walked away with about $30 million?""
Musk replied, ""We do find it sort of rather odd that, you know, there are quite a few people in the bureaucracy who have ostensibly a salary of a few hundred thousand dollars but somehow managed to accrue tens of millions of dollars in net worth while they are in that position. Which is, you know, what happened to USAID, we're just curious as to where it came from.""

""Sounds very fishy,"" Musk wrote.
Contrary to Nawfal’s claim, Power’s assets did not ""skyrocket""; she already held assets averaging a total of $20 million before she became head of USAID.
In his post, Nawfal cited ""vBulletin"" and ""Inside Biden’s Basement"" as sources. The latter website, which says it tracks Biden administration alumni, estimated Power’s net worth between $10.1 million and $30.3 million. PolitiFact found no public evidence of the claim from the community forum software program vBulletin, which hosts private forums.
Power ran USAID for nearly four years under President Joe Biden, from May 2021 to January 2025. During the Obama administration, she served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations from 2013 to 2017, and held a senior staff position at the National Security Council from 2009 to 2013. Power was a Harvard Kennedy School professor and has written multiple books, including ""The Education of an Idealist,"" ""A Problem from Hell"" and ""Chasing the Flame."" 
After Biden nominated Power to be USAID administrator in January 2021, she filed a financial disclosure report as required.
PolitiFact analyzed her financial disclosures from January 2021, May 2022, May 2023 and May 2024. These disclosures generally don’t include assets or government income. They permit officials to report their assets and liabilities in range values, not fixed amounts, so it’s difficult to know their exact net worth. 
We took the minimum and maximum amounts of Power’s assets, her spouse’s assets, and ""other assets and incomes"" she reported, and added them together. Then, we subtracted Power’s reported liabilities to get her net worth. 
In 2021, Power’s assets and income sources included compensation and benefits from her teaching position at Harvard University, capital gains from venture capital firm the Social+Capital Partnership LLC, multiple book royalties and honoraria from speaking engagements. In ""other assets and income,"" Power listed cash values in 12 U.S. banks, several Vanguard holdings, and other stocks.

All the assets listed in Power’s financial disclosure totaled $11 million to $30 million. Power listed one item — a mortgage — under liabilities, valued from $500,001 to $1 million, which would have made her net worth between $10 million and $29.5 million. It was the only liability Powers reported for four years. 
Her total combined assets did not fluctuate wildly during her term. In 2022, her average net worth was $20.9 million; in 2023, $18.2 million; and in 2024, $20.8 million.

The score indicates a low degree of relevance.  Let's break down why:

The image shows Samantha Power in Kyiv, Ukraine, seemingly during an official visit.  Visible elements include:

* **Samantha Power:** The central focus is Power herself, easily identifiable.  This is the primary reason for the ""Related"" classification.  The claim is *about* her.
* **Setting:** The background clearly indicates an official visit to a foreign country (Ukraine).  This suggests her professional life, which is tangentially related to the wealth claim.  Her work as USAID administrator could indirectly relate to her financial standing, although the connection is weak.  The image doesn't offer any direct evidence of wealth.
* **No indicators of wealth:**  The image contains no visible luxury items, lavish surroundings, or anything else that would visually suggest a significant net worth.

**Why the low similarity score (0.34)?**

The low similarity score reflects the lack of direct connection between the image's content and the claim's essence.  The image shows Power in her professional capacity, while the claim focuses on her personal finances.  The image doesn't provide visual evidence supporting or refuting the claim.  The connection is merely contextual:  the image is *of* the person mentioned in the claim.

In summary, the ""Related"" classification is based solely on the presence of Samantha Power in the image.  The image doesn't visually represent or allude to her wealth or the alleged increase in her net worth.  The low similarity score reflects the weak and indirect nature of this connection.  A higher score would require the image to show something directly relevant to the claim, such as expensive properties, luxury goods, or even news headlines about her wealth.

There's no clear indication of who these individuals are beyond their attire suggesting a professional or political context.  Crucially, neither Tulsi Gabbard nor Donald Trump are visibly present in the photograph.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a low similarity score (0.30) is likely due to several factors:

1. **Contextual Clues:** The image's formal setting and the attire of the individuals suggest a political or governmental event. This *context* is vaguely related to the claim about Gabbard and Trump's interaction at a swearing-in ceremony.  The connection is extremely weak, relying purely on inference, not direct evidence.

2. **Absence of Key Individuals:** The complete absence of Tulsi Gabbard and Donald Trump in the image is the strongest argument against a direct relationship.  The claim specifically mentions their presence, which is demonstrably false based on the visual information.

3. **Low Similarity Score:** The low similarity score (0.30) explicitly indicates a weak relationship.  CLIP likely found some superficial commonalities related to the formal setting and the presence of suited individuals, but not enough to establish a strong connection to the specific claim.  The score reflects the lack of any direct visual evidence supporting the claim.

4. **Limited Information:**  The image provides limited information. There are no identifying labels, logos, or background details that could corroborate or contradict the claim. The image is essentially a generic photograph of a group of people in formal attire.

In summary, the CLIP model likely classified the image as ""Related"" based on a very weak contextual association – the formal setting hinting at a potential governmental event. However, the absence of the two key individuals mentioned in the claim and the low similarity score strongly suggest the image is largely irrelevant to the claim's veracity.  The relationship is almost entirely circumstantial and lacks any direct visual evidence.

On her eponymous podcast’s Feb. 3 episode, former Fox News host Megyn Kelly asked Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., whether he would root for the Kansas City Chiefs to defeat the Philadelphia Eagles during the Feb. 9 championship game. 
""So, does this mean, since you used to coach Patrick Mahomes, that you’re rooting for the Chiefs at the big game this Sunday?"" Kelly asked. Tuberville spent 40 years as a college football coach — including at Mahomes’ alma mater Texas Tech University — before becoming a U.S. senator. 
With a smile, Tuberville gently corrected Kelly. 
""Well, I never even coached him,"" he said. ""What happened is — I recruited him. And then I left and went to another school. But I’ve got to be very good friends with him. He’s a good — not just a good athlete. He’s a very good example for a lot of our young youth across this country.""

But Tuberville’s attempt to clarify was more of a fumble.
""He did not recruit me at the time,"" Mahomes said during a Feb. 6 press conference in response to a question about whether he had any relationship with Tuberville. ""I don’t — I don’t remember if I ever got to meet him or not.""
We contacted Tuberville’s office and received no reply.
Tuberville was Texas Tech’s head football coach from 2010 to 2012, three full seasons. He resigned as head coach Dec. 8, 2012. 
Mahomes played for Texas Tech from 2014 to 2016, before the NFL’s Kansas City Chiefs drafted him in 2017. 
News reports credit Tuberville’s successor, Kliff Kingsbury, with recruiting Mahomes. 
In 2022, ESPN reported that Kingsbury first noticed Mahomes in 2012, when Kingsbury was Texas A&M University’s offensive coordinator and Mahomes was a student-athlete at Whitehouse High School in East Texas. Then, when Kingsbury became Texas Tech’s head football coach, he prioritized recruiting Mahomes, ESPN reported. 
""We went after him hard and knew that we needed to get him,"" Kingsbury told ESPN in 2022.

Mahomes said Kingsbury taught him a lot and helped him become the player he is now, according to Arrowhead Pride, a website that writes about the Chiefs.
""(Texas Tech was) really the first and only,"" Mahomes said, according to Arrowhead Pride. ""I didn’t get recruited by (many schools); I got a couple other offers from smaller schools in the Texas area ... I credit Kingsbury, because he was the one who came down and saw me, talked to me, talked to my family and believed in me. That’s the reason I’m in this position — because he gave me a chance.""
President Donald Trump also has falsely said that Tuberville coached Mahomes.
Our ruling
Tuberville said as head football coach at Texas Tech, he ""recruited"" Mahomes and the two got to be ""good friends."" 
Mahomes said Tuberville ""did not recruit me,"" and added that he wasn’t certain he’d ever met Tuberville.  
Tuberville’s time as Texas Tech University’s head football coach didn’t overlap with Mahomes’ time on the team. In news reports, Mahomes has credited Kingsbury, Tuberville’s Texas Tech successor, with recruiting him.

The claim states that Kliff Kingsbury, the speaker (implied but not explicitly named in the claim), recruited Mahomes and is friends with him.  The relatively low similarity score of 0.27 from CLIP reflects the weak connection between the image and the claim.

Here's a breakdown of why the connection is weak, despite the image being classified as 'Related':

* **Lack of Kliff Kingsbury:** The image contains no visual representation of Kliff Kingsbury.  The claim hinges on Kingsbury's relationship with Mahomes, but the image provides no evidence of this relationship.  The claim's validity relies entirely on Kingsbury's assertion.

* **Generic Football Scene:** The image is a fairly generic shot of a football practice. It shows Mahomes in a football setting, which is relevant to the claim because Mahomes is the subject of the claim. However, the image doesn't specifically depict an event related to his recruitment or Kingsbury's friendship with him.  Any connection is inferred, not explicitly shown.

* **Ambiguous Context:** The image doesn't provide context regarding the time period.  While it shows Mahomes, it doesn't indicate whether this photo was taken before, during, or after Kingsbury's coaching tenure at Texas Tech.  This ambiguity weakens the link.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The 0.27 similarity score from CLIP reinforces the weak visual connection.  This score suggests only a very tenuous relationship between the image's content and the claim's assertion. CLIP likely identifies the common element of Patrick Mahomes, but lacks strong contextual evidence to bolster the connection beyond a basic association.

In summary, the image's relevance to the claim is indirect and weak. The image shows Mahomes, a key component of the claim, but doesn't visually corroborate any part of Kingsbury's assertion about recruiting Mahomes and their friendship. The low similarity score reflects this lack of strong visual evidence supporting the claim. The relationship is purely inferential; one must already know the context of Kingsbury's coaching career to even make a weak connection.

About three weeks after the Oct. 7, 2024, interview aired, Trump sued CBS Broadcasting Inc. and CBS Interactive Inc. for $10 billion, claiming the news outlet deceptively edited the ""60 Minutes"" interview to favor Harris. Then, at the end of January, the Federal Communications Commission, led by Trump appointee Brendan Carr, called on CBS to release the unedited transcript and video. CBS News complied, releasing the content publicly Feb. 5.
In response, Trump posted Feb. 6 on his social media platform Truth Social that CBS committed ""fraud.""
""CBS and 60 Minutes defrauded the public by doing something which has never, to this extent, been seen before,"" Trump wrote. ""They 100% removed Kamala’s horrible election changing answers to questions, and replaced them with completely different, and far better, answers, taken from another part of the interview.""

Trump is referring to Harris’ answers in two videos CBS News released. In an Oct. 6, 2024, video clip previewing the interview on the CBS News show ""Face the Nation,"" Harris answered a question about U.S.-Israel relations. The next day, when the ""60 Minutes"" interview aired, it showed Harris giving a different answer to the same question.
The full, unedited interview transcript shows that CBS News’ ""60 Minutes"" took Harris’ answers in both videos from the same three-and-a-half-minute exchange on U.S.-Israel relations. It does not show that CBS News replaced Harris’ answers on this topic with a response from a different portion of the interview.
It’s typical for news outlets to edit long interviews into shorter broadcast segments or published stories.
Trump backed out of his CBS News ""60 Minutes"" interview before the 2024 election, breaking a decadeslong tradition of major party presidential candidates’ interviews with the network ahead of the general election.
PolitiFact contacted the White House for comment, but received no response.
What the full, unedited transcript shows
Because the interview aired on the anniversary of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, ""60 Minutes"" correspondent Bill Whitaker began the interview with questions about Israel and the Biden-Harris administration’s relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
PolitiFact annotated the unedited interview transcript below to show how ""60 Minutes"" presented Harris’ answers in the preview clip and aired interview.
Here’s a guide, followed by the exchange:
Bold: Only in the preview clip.
Italics: Only in the aired interview.
Bold and italics: In both videos.
Unmarked sections: Not included in either video.
Whitaker: ""We supply Israel with billions of dollars in military aid.""
Harris: ""Mm-hmm.""
Whitaker: ""And yet Prime Minister Netanyahu seems to be charting his own course. The Biden administration, the Biden-Harris administration has pressed him to agree to a cease-fire, he's resisted. You urged him not to go into Lebanon, he went in anyway. He has promised to make Iran pay for the missile attack, and that has the potential of expanding the war. Does the U.S. have no sway over Prime Minister Netanyahu?""
Harris: ""Well, let’s start with this. On this subject, the aid that we have given Israel allowed Israel to defend itself against 200 ballistic missiles that were just meant to attack the Israelis, and the people of Israel. And I think that is the most recent example of why what we do to assist in their defense around military aid is important. And when we think about the threat that Hamas, Hezbollah presents Iran, I think that it is without any question our imperative to do what we can to allow Israel to defend itself against those kinds of attacks. Now, the work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles, which include the need for humanitarian aid, the need for this war to end, the need for a deal to be done which would release the hostages, and create a cease-fire. And we’re not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel, and in the region, including with other leaders in the region, including Arab leaders.""
Whitaker: ""But it seems that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening. The Wall Street Journal said that he — that your administration has repeatedly been blindsided by Netanyahu, and in fact, he has rebuffed just about all of your administration’s entreaties.""
Harris: ""Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region. And we’re not going to stop doing that. We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.""
Whitaker: ""Just one last thing. Do we have a real close ally in Prime Minister Netanyahu?""
Harris: ""I think, with all due respect, the better question is do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people. And the answer to that question is, ‘Yes.’ And we are going to do what is important to support whatever leadership is in Israel, that is defending the security of the State of Israel.""

After this response, Whitaker changed topics to ask Harris why she wanted to be president. The Israel topic arose only once more during the interview, when Harris briefly mentioned Iran’s ballistic missile attack on Israel.
The full, unedited interview video is available on ""60 Minutes"" YouTube page. The exchange about U.S.-Israel relations starts about six minutes in.

Why did ""60 Minutes"" share different clips?
When publishing the transcripts and video the Federal Communications Commission requested, CBS News said in a statement that the content shows ""the ‘60 Minutes’ broadcast was not doctored or deceitful.""
In its statement, CBS News noted that it’s common practice for journalists to edit interviews for time, space or clarity. The full, unedited interview video is 57 minutes long; that was edited down to 20 minutes.
CBS News said it broadcast a longer portion of Harris’ answer to Whitaker’s question about U.S.-Israel relations in a preview clip and a shorter version of Harris’ answer was included in the aired interview.
The news outlet said it edited the ""60 Minutes"" interview to include as much of Harris’ answers to Whitaker’s questions as possible, while fairly representing the substance of Harris’ answers.
CBS News made a similar statement Oct. 20, 2024, rebutting Trump’s accusation of deceitful editing.
Kelly McBride, senior vice president and chair of Craig Newmark Center for Ethics and Leadership at the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, told PolitiFact that CBS News’ ""60 Minutes"" edited the Harris interview reasonably. (The Poynter Institute owns PolitiFact.)
""I would say that their edits are completely within the standards that journalists employ when they try to create an informative product for the public,"" McBride said. ""It seems very much like what journalists do with all verbose speakers, including and especially Donald Trump.""
Our ruling
Trump posted on Truth Social that CBS News and 60 Minutes ""replaced"" Harris’ ""60 Minutes"" interview answers ""with completely different, and far better, answers, taken from another part of the interview.""
The full, unedited interview transcript does not show that CBS News’ ""60 Minutes"" replaced all of Harris’ answers to questions about U.S.-Israel relations with a response from a different part of the interview. CBS did not change Harris’ meaning.
News outlets commonly edit interviews for length and clarity. CBS News used a longer version of Harris’ response in a video clip previewing the ""60 Minutes"" interview on the CBS News show ""Face the Nation."" It used a shorter excerpt of Harris’ answer in the aired ""60 Minutes"" interview. Both parts of Harris’ answer were taken from the same segment of the interview, the unedited transcript shows.
A media ethics expert said the ""60 Minutes"" interview adhered to typical journalistic standards.

The relationship between this image and the claim about CBS News and ""60 Minutes"" altering her interview answers is weak, and a similarity score of 0.32 reflects this.  The low score indicates a tenuous connection at best.  CLIP's classification as 'Related' is likely due to a superficial association rather than a meaningful one.

Here's why the connection is weak:

* **No direct visual connection:** The image shows Kamala Harris in a formal setting, unrelated to a CBS News or ""60 Minutes"" interview. There's no mention of the interview or any related individuals or objects in the picture.  The image is purely a depiction of Harris at a public event.

* **Indirect thematic connection:** The only indirect link is the presence of Kamala Harris herself.  The claim is about *her* interview being manipulated, and the image shows *her*.  This is a very weak link, as countless images of Harris exist, most unrelated to this specific claim.

* **Contextual dependence:**  The claim's validity relies entirely on evidence outside the image. The image provides no information about the veracity or falsity of the claim.  CLIP cannot analyze the content of the news interview or its editing.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The score of 0.32 clearly indicates a low level of visual similarity and semantic relevance.  This reinforces the conclusion that the connection is superficial and based solely on the presence of Harris in the image.

In summary, CLIP likely classified the image as 'Related' because Kamala Harris is the common element between the image and the claim. However, this connection is weak and relies on a broad, indirect thematic relationship rather than a direct visual or contextual link. The low similarity score supports the conclusion that the relationship is tenuous and mostly coincidental.  The image provides no evidence to support or refute the claim about the interview alteration.

The S-76B is a luxury helicopter used to ferry celebrities and other high profile figures. It can be customized to seat five to eight passengers along with crew members, according to its makers.
A small number of this helicopter model is used by air ambulances and during search and rescue, but its primary clientele are VIPs. ""Ten countries rely on the S-76 for the Head of State mission,"" according to Lockheed Martin. About 875 have been sold since it was first introduced in 1977, the company said.
The Sikorsky UH-60 ""Black Hawk"" is far from a luxury aircraft. Unlike the sleekly designed S-76B, the Black Hawk is rugged and multifunctional. The U.S. Army has used the Black Hawk in its fleet for 47 years.
""It provides air assault, general support, aeromedical evacuation, command and control, and special operations support to combat, stability and support operations,"" the Army said.
The UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter can seat 12 soldiers and can also serve in firefighting and search and rescue operations. 
The California Army National Guard deployed Black Hawks in January fire fighting operations in southern California. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency has used the UH-60 to patrol the southern border in search of illegal border crossers, and Canadian authorities recently said they will be using Black Hawks to surveil a section of its border with the United States for unauthorized migrant crossings.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.29 to the claim ""The U.S. Army helicopter in the Jan. 29 plane collision was the same model of helicopter in the 2020 Kobe Bryant crash"" is relatively low and reflects a weak connection.  The connection stems from the visual similarity between the *type* of helicopter depicted in the image and the type involved in the Kobe Bryant crash,  *not* the specific helicopter involved in the January 29th incident.

Here's a breakdown of why the classification is weak:

* **Visual Similarity (Limited):** The image shows a crashed Sikorsky S-76B helicopter, a model famously involved in the Kobe Bryant crash.  The claim mentions a *different* helicopter, a U.S. Army helicopter involved in a separate incident. While both might share some general characteristics as helicopters,  they are not the same model unless the army helicopter was also an S-76B.  The image doesn't show the army helicopter, only one of the same *model* as the Kobe Bryant crash helicopter. This visual similarity is the basis for the weak ""Related"" classification.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The score of 0.29 indicates a relatively weak relationship. CLIP likely considers the visual features of the wrecked S-76B, but it lacks information to connect it directly to the January 29th incident.  The context of the claim is crucial here, which CLIP doesn't fully grasp.

* **Missing Information:** The image provides no information about the January 29th incident.  It shows only a wrecked Sikorsky S-76B, relevant to the Kobe Bryant crash, but irrelevant to confirming or denying whether the unrelated army helicopter was the same model.  CLIP lacks the ability to reason about this missing link.

* **Ambiguity:** The claim is about the *model* of the helicopters, not the specific helicopter.  The image supports part of the claim (shows the model used in the Bryant crash), but doesn't address whether the army helicopter in the other incident was of the same *model*.

In conclusion, the ""Related"" classification is driven by the visual presence of an S-76B helicopter in the image, a model relevant to the Kobe Bryant crash mentioned in the claim. However, the low similarity score accurately reflects the lack of direct connection between the image and the claim's core assertion concerning the specific army helicopter's model involved in a different incident.  The relationship is weak because the image only shows one aspect (the helicopter model) of a more complex claim involving another, unpictured helicopter.

The image shows a digitally manipulated graphic designed to look like a Coca-Cola advertisement.  However, the content is demonstrably false and doesn't reflect any official Coca-Cola communication.

* **Absence of Apology:** The image contains no text expressing an apology from Coca-Cola to immigrants or anyone else.  The claim explicitly mentions an apology, which is entirely absent from the visual.

* **Misleading Content:** The image uses Coca-Cola's branding to convey a message that is likely fabricated. The text in the image, even if legible, is not verifiable as an official Coca-Cola statement.  This fabricated nature directly contradicts the claim's assertion of an official apology.

* **Visual Discrepancy:**  The graphic style, font choices, and overall design of the image don't match the usual visual language of official Coca-Cola advertisements.  This visual inconsistency suggests it's not a legitimate company communication.

* **Contextual Dissonance:** The claim implies an official, public apology from Coca-Cola, likely through a press release or similar public statement.  The image, being a single, seemingly independently created graphic, lacks the official channels and context that would accompany such a significant announcement.

In essence, the image is a piece of misinformation leveraging Coca-Cola's branding for a false narrative. It presents no evidence to support the claim of an apology.  The low similarity score reflects the significant disconnect between the factual assertion of an official apology (the claim) and the fabricated, visually inconsistent image.

If signed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis — who has threatened to veto it — the Legislature’s immigration bill would revoke a 2014 law that lets immigrants in the country illegally who meet certain conditions pay in-state college tuition rates, which are typically much lower than out-of-state rates. The Legislature could override a DeSantis veto.
One supporter of eliminating the law, state Sen. Randy Fine, R-Brevard, said during a Jan. 28 special session the waiver encourages illegal immigration.

While listing reasons for eliminating the law, Fine, who cosponsored the immigration bill, said: ""Number one: it costs money. … We estimate $41 million dollars.""

During the special session, state Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando, pressed Fine on that point, saying, ""You’ve mentioned several times that we’re going to be saving $41 million. … So, you’re saying once we repeal in-state tuition we are going to get that $41 million back into the general revenue so we can reappropriate that, right? We are going to be saving as a state.""
Fine said, ""The universities would get to keep the $41 million. All tuition in the state goes directly to the universities.""
PolitiFact contacted Fine’s office to ask about the $41 million figure’s source. His office sent us the Senate analysis of the immigration bill, which estimated that for the 2023-24 fiscal year the value of the waived out-of-state fees totaled about $40.6 million.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
But that is not the same as the state paying that amount for the program.

The Senate analysis also says the fiscal impact of repealing the provision cannot be determined because it would be hard to identify exactly how many students would be affected. The waivers don’t identify the students by immigration status, but the in-state tuition waiver for immigrants in the country illegally has steep requirements to qualify, so experts believe only that group would apply for it.
""The revenue impact will also depend on the behavior of affected students,"" and whether they choose to reenroll without waivers, the analysis concludes. ""While the cumulative amount of the fee waivers was more than $40 million in (fiscal year) 2023-2024, it is not clear that institutions will receive that revenue with the changes to the fee waiver.""
Florida’s in-state college tuition waiver
In 2014, then-Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, signed House Bill 851, allowing immigrants in the country illegally to pay in-state college tuition rates if they meet certain requirements. ""Students that grew up in our state are going to get the same in-state tuition as their peers, which is what's fair,"" Scott said.
Florida, which is among 25 states with similar ""tuition-equity"" laws, offers a number of student waivers. The one given to immigrants in the country illegally is the 5012 nonresident waiver.

To qualify, students must prove that they graduated from a Florida high school, spent at least three consecutive years in Florida schools immediately before graduating and applied to a higher education institution within 24 months of high school graduation. (Immigrants in the country illegally remain ineligible for Florida scholarships such as Bright Futures and federal financial aid.)

The waiver’s requirements are stricter than those for legal residents and U.S. citizens, who must show they’ve lived in the state for at least 12 months before the academic term.

In-state tuition costs around $3,000 for Florida’s community colleges and $6,000 for public universities. Out-of-state tuition rates can cost more than three times as much. 
Will eliminating the waiver save the state money?
The Florida Policy Institute, a center-left research organization, said in a Jan. 15 report that ""contrary to how some state lawmakers have recently framed the fiscal impact of these waivers,"" allowing immigrants in the country illegally to access in-state tuition ""has not cost the state money."" Instead, the institute estimated that the waiver has ""generated millions in revenue for institutions experiencing drops in enrollment and financial strain.""

Take the Florida College System, previously known as community colleges. About 4,500 students used the in-state tuition waiver at those schools during the 2023-24 academic year, bringing in about $14.7 million in tuition, according to Florida Policy Institute’s calculation.
Enrollment at the 28-member college system remains 11% below prepandemic levels and education experts say it’s unlikely that enough new students would enroll to replace immigrants in the country illegally.

""There are no students ‘waiting in the wings’ to replace tuition paid by these students and the potential for colleges to lose out on this revenue is high,"" the Florida Policy Institute said in its report.

Second lady Usha Vance “will have her citizenship revoked if (President Donald) Trump signs his executive order banning birthright citizenship.”
By Sara Swann • January 21, 2025
The Florida Policy Institute and Senate analysis arrived at their waiver value estimates in different ways. The Senate’s analysis appears to reflect the difference between out-of-state and in-state tuition for students who received the waivers.

The Florida Policy Institute estimated how much students receiving waivers paid in tuition by multiplying the number of students who received the waiver in the 2023-24 academic year by the average cost of in-state tuition. The organization estimated that about 6,500 immigrants in the country illegally used the waiver to attend Florida’s colleges and state universities, paying about $26.7 million in in-state tuition and fees.

""It is misleading to say the waivers ‘cost’ $40.6 million because in reality, if students are not offered this waiver, many will not attend school in Florida at all,"" said Alexis Tsoukalas, a senior policy analyst at Florida Policy Institute and author of the brief. 
Florida colleges and universities are supported by Florida residents’ taxes, so ""state residents can attend public institutions at a lower cost than those not residents of the state,"" according to the Florida Department of Education. In Florida, immigrants in the country illegally paid about $1.8 billion in state and local taxes in 2022.
Our ruling
Fine said Florida’s in-state college tuition waiver for immigrants in the country illegally costs the state $41 million.

One analysis shows that the value of the waivers was more than $40 million in fiscal year 2023-24. That doesn’t mean the state paid that amount for the program. The program does not technically cost the state money.
Fine’s statement has an element of truth in that if the waiver is eliminated, public colleges and universities could receive more money in tuition payments from immigrants in the country illegally if they still chose to enroll, or other students wanting to enroll in the institutions. 
But education policy experts estimate that revoking the provision would likely cause colleges and universities to lose revenue. There likely aren’t enough students to enroll to make up for the loss of immigrants in the country illegally, who might not be able to afford tuition without the waiver. Many of Florida’s colleges already have enrollment numbers below pre-pandemic levels.

The image (a stock photo of hands holding a pile of money) is a generic representation of money and finance. It lacks any specific connection to Florida, immigration policy, college tuition, or the specific numerical figure of $41 million.

Here's a breakdown of why the low similarity score is appropriate:

* **Lack of Specific Context:** The image is entirely devoid of any context related to the claim.  It doesn't show students, college campuses, legal documents, or anything that would visually link it to the topic of college tuition waivers or immigration.

* **Generic Nature of the Image:** The image is a widely usable stock photo that could accompany almost any article about money, finance, budgets, or even wealth inequality. Its generality prevents it from being specifically relevant to the Florida tuition waiver claim.

* **Absence of Numerical Data:** The claim includes a specific monetary figure ($41 million). The image contains no numbers or graphical representations of that amount.

* **No Geographic Indication:** The claim is specifically about Florida. The image provides no indication of location.

* **CLIP's Focus on Visual Similarity:** CLIP analyzes visual features to determine similarity.  The visual features of the image (hands, money) are simply not strongly associated with the concepts mentioned in the claim.  The connection would have to be inferred, and CLIP is not designed for strong inferential reasoning.

In summary, the low similarity score reflects the complete lack of visual connection between a generic image of money and the highly specific claim about a Florida state policy.  The image's generality and the claim's specificity are fundamentally incompatible, resulting in a low similarity score.  A relevant image might have shown students attending a Florida college, a relevant policy document, or a graph depicting state spending on education.

""Peachy, cool arrow,"" sounds like ""pinche culero,"" which is an expletive in Spanish.
The Instagram video showed markers of a deepfake, such as Trump’s mouth movements not syncing with audio. Trump’s attire and background in the video match those in an interview with NBC News’ Lester Holt, uploaded May 11, 2017. 
Trump’s movements match those in a portion of the clip from 12:30 to 12:42. He said the following: ""But when I spoke with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, he asked me whether or not I would see (Russian Foreign Minister Sergei) Lavrov. Now what do I, should I say, ‘No, I’m not gonna see him’?

The tweet itself is not directly about President Trump being called ""peachy cool arrow"" by Mexicans.  Instead, the tweet is a sarcastic, arguably mocking, response to a claim *about* President Trump's interactions with Mexicans.  The claim in the tweet's text doesn't contain the exact phrase ""peachy cool arrow,"" but it operates within a similar context of humorous or ironic commentary on perceived interactions between Trump and the Mexican population.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.33 suggests a weak relationship. This low score reflects the lack of direct textual overlap.  There's no mention of ""peachy cool arrow"" within the image's tweet.  The relationship is inferred, not explicitly stated.

The model likely found a connection based on the following:

* **Shared Subject:** Both the claim and the image's tweet concern President Donald Trump and his relationship with, or perception by, Mexicans.  This shared subject matter provides a tenuous link.

* **Contextual Similarity:** The tweet's sarcastic tone and its focus on a potentially fabricated or exaggerated account of Trump's interactions with Mexicans align with the overall absurdity of the claim ""Mexicans call him 'peachy cool arrow.'""  Both the claim and the tweet occupy a similar space of potentially false or humorous narratives about Trump and his relationship with this demographic.

* **Absence of Direct Contradiction:** The tweet doesn't directly refute the claim; it doesn't explicitly state that Mexicans *don't* call Trump ""peachy cool arrow."" This lack of direct opposition might have influenced the model to consider a relationship, albeit a weak one.

The low similarity score (0.33) correctly reflects the weak connection. The image and the claim share a broad theme but lack specific textual or visual overlap. The model is likely picking up on the shared subject and the general satirical/humorous context, rather than any direct evidence supporting or refuting the ""peachy cool arrow"" claim.  In essence, the relationship is based on contextual association, not direct evidence.

* **Absence of Key Elements:** The image lacks any visual elements mentioning Jon Maravilla, American Airlines, Washington D.C., or a helicopter crash.  There are no logos, names, or any other identifying information that would connect it to the specific claim.

* **Generic Airport Scene:** The image depicts a busy, possibly congested, airport scene. This is a common visual and doesn't provide any specifics about a particular flight, airline, or incident. The presence of luggage, people rushing, and potentially airport staff is generic and does not link to the extraordinary event described in the claim.

* **Lack of Specific Details:** Even subtle details that might hint at the claim are absent. For example, there are no visible signs of a crash, wreckage, emergency personnel, or unusual activity that would suggest an accident has occurred.

* **Ambiguity of the Scene:** The image is chaotic, and it's difficult to discern any specific events from it. The high level of activity could be due to a multitude of reasons, none of which are necessarily related to the described plane crash.

* **CLIP's Functionality:** CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training) works by comparing the visual features extracted from an image with the semantic meaning of a textual description. Because the image contains none of the visual features or contextual clues related to the specific details in the claim, the resulting similarity score is extremely low.  The model correctly identifies the lack of any meaningful overlap between the image content and the description.

In essence, the image is a generic representation of an airport scene, while the claim describes a specific, extraordinary event.  The complete lack of any visual correlation is why CLIP produces such a low similarity score and correctly classifies the image as unrelated.

The posts are wrong on two counts:
The flag icon atop many government websites is not new or unique to the second Trump administration. It was first used in 2017 during Trump’s first term and was used throughout former President Joe Biden’s administration. 
Civil War historians told PolitiFact that the flag used bears no resemblance to a confederate flag.
(Screenshots from X and Instagram.)
About the flag icon
A U.S. General Services Association spokesperson told PolitiFact in an email that the banner atop government websites is part of the U.S. Web Design System’s tool kit. The system helps government teams design and maintain their websites.
The tool kit recommends using the banner with the flag icon to identify official .gov or .mil domains to show the sites have secure HTTPS connections and to identify them as official government sites, the spokesperson said.
The banner hasn’t changed since its first publication in 2017. The number of stars was a design decision based on the flag icon’s limited size, and represents no past or current flags, the spokesperson said.
A State Department spokesperson said the General Services Administration maintains the federal website standards site, which said all government sites should use the federal government banner.
The State Department added the banner Nov. 30, 2020, based on that guidance, and it has remained on the site since, the spokesperson said.
A search of the Internet Archive shows several government websites using the nine-star flag icon before the start of Trump’s second term.
(Screenshot from a State Department website archived March 17, 2021, by the Internet Archive.)
Confederacy claims
Civil war historians told PolitiFact that the flag used on the website is not a Confederate flag.
The Confederacy’s first national flag, known as the ""Stars and Bars,"" was used from 1861 to 1863. Some versions of the flag had nine stars, they said.
""It started out with seven stars, one for each of the original states that seceded and formed the Confederacy,"" Paul Quigley, director of Virginia Tech University’s Virginia Center for Civil War Studies, said. ""As more states seceded and joined the Confederacy, more stars were added to the flag."" 
Those stars were arranged in a circle, not horizontally as seen atop the government websites. The Confederate flag also had one white and two red bars, far fewer bars than the government flag icon.
Because the flag’s similarity to the traditional Stars and Stripes caused confusion on the battlefield, the Confederacy in 1863 switched to the Second National Flag, known as the ""Stainless Banner,"" Quigley said. That flag arranged 13 stars in a St. Andrews Cross.
Scot Guenter, director of the Flag Research Center, a Houston-based group, said the flag icon on U.S. government sites is not an actual flag used by the government or the Confederacy, and was simply a design choice.

""Unfortunately, ramifications of using a variant of the true national flag that is just made up by an artist for looks didn’t even occur to whoever did this,"" Guenter said.
Kevin Levin, an author and historian, told PolitiFact he noticed many Bluesky social media users, including prominent people he respects, sharing the Confederate flag claim. He wrote two articles on Substack, an online platform for writers and journalists, debunking the claim.
Levin wrote that many people defending the claim pointed to a photo of a flag for sale on a website called Historical Americana Co. That flag had nine stars arranged horizontally and nine stripes. The site described it as a ""post Civil War re-union UCV Flag.""
UCV stands for United Confederate Veterans, a group that was formed in 1889 and dissolved in 1952. Levin wrote that the veterans group did not create its own flag, and no promotional material from the group shows the flag offered for sale.
Levin told PolitiFact that he’s never seen that flag before, nor have any experts he’s asked in recent days. Quigley also said he had not seen that flag before.
""I can say with confidence that it's not a Confederate veterans flag at all,"" Levin said.
Shae Smith Cox, a Texas A&M University assistant history professor who researches the Civil War, said that the flag for sale appears to be homemade and created for a United Confederate Veterans reunion, possibly during the ""memory phase"" of the Confederacy, when she said Union and Confederacy groups competed over how the Civil War would be remembered.
""There were no regulations on what people could create for that phase,"" Smith Cox said. 
The flag’s seller estimated the flag is from 1900 to 1920, which would be in that era, Smith Cox said, adding that 1913 marked the Battle of Gettysburg’s 50th anniversary. 
Our ruling
Social media posts claimed that the Trump administration, while updating federal webpages, added a nine-star flag representing the Confederacy atop each website. 
The flag icon has been used on government sites since 2017, said a spokesperson for the General Services Association, which guides federal website standards. The flag had only nine stars because of space, and it has no relation to any current or past U.S. flag, the spokesperson said.
Civil War experts told PolitiFact the nine-star flag bears no resemblance to Confederate flags. The first Confederate national flag had a varying number of stars corresponding with the number of states that had seceded from the union. Some versions had nine stars, but they were arranged in a circle, not horizontally like the government website flag.

The claim states that federal websites were updated with this flag, representing the Confederacy.  The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.26 indicates a weak positive correlation, meaning there's some connection but not a strong one.  Let's analyze why:

The low similarity score (0.26) is crucial.  It suggests that while the image contains elements relevant to the claim, it doesn't definitively support it.  The connection is tenuous.

Here's a breakdown of why CLIP might find a weak relationship:

* **Presence of the Nine-Star Flag:** The image's primary content is a nine-star flag, which is directly relevant to the claim. This is the strongest point of connection. The nine-star flag is strongly associated with the Confederacy, although it's not the *only* flag associated with it.

* **Lack of Contextual Evidence:** The image lacks crucial context.  It doesn't show the website's URL, indicating whether it's a federal website.  There's no indication of the date the screenshot was taken, making it impossible to verify whether it reflects a recent update.  The absence of this context significantly weakens the connection to the claim.

* **Ambiguous Surroundings:** The surrounding webpage elements in the screenshot are not readily identifiable as belonging to a federal website.  A typical federal website often has specific design elements, logos, and URL structures that would help corroborate the claim.  The absence of these features further reduces the confidence in the connection.

* **Screenshot Nature:**  The image is a screenshot, and screenshots can be manipulated.  Without further verification, it's impossible to confirm the authenticity and source of the image.

In summary, CLIP likely established the weak ""Related"" classification because the image contains the nine-star flag, a key element of the claim. However, the lack of supporting context—specifically proof of the website's federal affiliation and the timing of the alleged update—results in a low similarity score.  The image alone is insufficient to confirm the claim; it only presents a visually related element.  More evidence is needed to definitively link the image to the claim of updated federal websites.

U.S. Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., appearing Feb. 2 on CBS’ ""Face the Nation,"" said when it comes to USAID funding, ""10 to 30 cents on the dollar is what actually goes to aid. So there's not the right amount of command and control that's going on with the way that it's set up currently."" 
Mast’s interview comments left viewers with the impression that most of the funding doesn’t go to people in need.

""I mean, you could, you could almost say — this is a little bit hyperbole — but there's probably more dollars that go towards state dinners around the (Washington) D.C. Beltway than what actually goes into rice and beans abroad,"" Mast said. But he said during the Trump administration, ""It's going to be 99.99% of cents on the dollar actually go towards what it's intended, instead of people around the Beltway.""
The 10 to 30 cents number Mast cited is what USAID said it gives to local organizations in foreign countries. But Mast mischaracterizes what happens with the rest of the money. 
A January USAID report recapping 2024 said that about 12.1% of all USAID funding goes directly to local organizations in foreign countries, including nongovernmental, private sector and government partners. The rest of the funding is distributed through international organizations and companies, some of which are based in the U.S., that spend it on food, medicine and other assistance in developing countries or pass it to organizations based in those countries, said George Ingram, senior fellow in the Center for Sustainable Development at the Brookings Institution, a think tank. 
Former U.S. Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-N.J., who served as assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor in the Obama administration, disputed Mast’s statement.
""Mast is referring to the ‘localization’ percentage — the share of USAID funds that reach the needy through small local organizations,"" versus through large global humanitarian organizations, Malinowski wrote Feb. 3 on X.
Mast’s office did not respond to our emailed request for his evidence. 
What will happen with USAID?
USAID’s future remained uncertain Feb. 5. A message on the agency’s website said that all agency personnel will be placed on leave Feb. 7 with some exceptions. We contacted the agency Feb. 3 for comment but received no reply.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters Feb. 3 that he is the agency’s acting administrator but had delegated the authority to someone else. Also Feb. 3, Rubio on Fox News accused USAID of ""rank insubordination,"" adding, ""We had no choice but to bring this thing under control."" He seemed open to reforming USAID rather than abolishing it.
""American foreign assistance programs are not charity; they are strategic investments that directly advance U.S. security, economic interests, and global influence,"" said Elisha Dunn-Georgiou, president and CEO of the Global Health Council, an agency that works with more than 130 organizations across 150 countries. 
How USAID funding is distributed
Experts on USAID said Mast likely was referring to the January report about the agency’s efforts to direct more funding to local partners. 
The report says in 2024, ""USAID provided $2.1 billion directly to local non-governmental, private sector and government partners, or 12.1 percent of USAID’s acquisitions and assistance (A&A) and government-to-government (G2G) funding.""  
That number falls within Mast’s cited range of 10 to 30 cents on the dollar. But that ""doesn’t mean that’s all that goes to the country,"" said Jen Kates, an expert on global health at KFF, a U.S. health policy organization.
Here’s how federal foreign aid is distributed: Congress appropriates funding, often for a specific program such as HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, nutrition or maternal health. But Congress often doesn’t dictate which organizations receive the money. 
The money then flows to U.S. agencies including USAID, which distributes aid mostly through what it calls ""implementing partners,"" such as private contractors, nonprofit organizations, foreign governments, international organizations and other U.S. government agencies, according to the Congressional Research Service. 
Those partners are often based in the U.S. In 2024 more than $1 billion of USAID funding went to American small businesses.

“FEMA sent $59M LAST WEEK to luxury hotels in New York City to house illegal migrants… That money is meant for American disaster relief.”
By Maria Ramirez Uribe • February 14, 2025
A single organization can receive USAID money to provide tuberculosis prevention treatment, malaria medicines or antibiotics in several foreign countries. These nonlocal organizations are not counted in that 12% figure.
The process is not new; foreign aid has been distributed this way during Democratic and Republican administrations, including Trump’s first term. 
USAID set a goal in 2021 to increase the share of aid that goes to local partners, and that had bipartisan support. 
How the claim spread 
Before Mast commented about USAID, other similar claims cited a Jan. 7 PBS interview that briefly quoted Walter Kerr, co-executive director of the nonprofit organization Unlock Aid. Kerr said, ""It’s actually less than 10% of our foreign assistance dollars flowing through USAID is actually reaching those communities."" 
Unlock Aid, which formed in 2021, advocates for improvements to U.S. aid, did not respond to our emails requesting comment. 
Musk and Republican Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah, reshared the PBS interview, seeming to cite Kerr’s comments as evidence of USAID corruption.
Our ruling
Mast said when it comes to USAID, ""10 to 30 cents on the dollar is what actually goes to aid."" 
Mast appeared to be referring to a USAID report on 2024 funding that said about 12.1% of the agency’s money goes directly to small local organizations in foreign countries. 
But money provided to local partners is only one portion of the aid. The rest of the money is distributed through ""implementing partners"" —  organizations and companies that operate internationally and which are often based in the U.S. The implementing partners spend the money on food, medicine and other assistance in developing countries or pass it to local organizations based in those countries.

Doge's speech bubble says, ""Such aid.  Much bureaucracy.  Wow.""  The image is visually connected to the claim ""From the U.S. Agency for International Development funding, '10 to 30 cents on the dollar is what actually goes to aid.'"" because it satirizes the alleged inefficiency of aid distribution.

The low similarity score of 0.25 reflects the tenuous nature of the connection.  CLIP isn't directly understanding the *meaning* of the meme; it's identifying visual and textual overlaps.  Here's how:

* **Textual Overlap:** The text in the meme (""Such aid"") vaguely relates to the subject of the claim (""aid"").  This is a weak connection, however, as the meme doesn't directly mention USAID or percentages.

* **Conceptual Overlap (Inferred by CLIP):**  CLIP likely makes an association between the meme's overall tone (sarcastic, implying inefficiency) and the claim's implication of significant overhead costs in USAID's aid distribution.  The words ""Much bureaucracy"" directly point to a potential reason why only a small percentage of the funding might reach its intended destination.  This is an inference CLIP makes based on learned associations between words and images, not a direct semantic understanding.

* **Lack of Direct Visual Connection:** The image itself contains no visual elements directly related to USAID, money, or the specific numbers mentioned in the claim.  There's no depiction of dollars, government buildings, or starving people (which could have strengthened the correlation).

In essence, CLIP's ""Related"" classification with a low similarity score is driven by a weak textual overlap (""aid"") and a more substantial, but still indirect, conceptual overlap based on the sarcastic tone of the meme and its implication of bureaucratic inefficiencies mirroring the claim's core assertion. The low score accurately reflects the lack of strong visual or precise textual correspondence between the meme and the claim. The connection is primarily inferential and based on a shared thematic concept (inefficient aid distribution), rather than direct visual or textual similarity.

The similarity score of 0.30 from CLIP indicates a weak but present relationship between the image and the claim ""U.S. figure skater Jon Maravilla was reportedly prevented from boarding a doomed flight to Washington, D.C.""

The reason for the ""Related"" classification, despite the low similarity score, is the direct connection between the image's content and the claim.  Both refer to Jon Maravilla and a flight he missed that subsequently crashed.  The headline explicitly states he missed a ""doomed flight,"" aligning with the claim's assertion that he was ""prevented from boarding a doomed flight.""

However, the low similarity score (0.30) reflects the differences between the claim and the image's explicit content. The claim specifies the destination as Washington, D.C., a detail not explicitly stated in the image's headline. The claim also uses the word ""reportedly,"" suggesting some uncertainty, while the image's headline presents the information more assertively.  The image also doesn't specify *how* Maravilla was prevented from boarding the flight, whereas the claim implies some action prevented him.

In summary, CLIP connects the claim and the image based on their shared core elements: Jon Maravilla and his avoidance of a fatal flight. The low similarity score reflects the lack of precise alignment regarding the flight's destination and the phrasing concerning the prevention of Maravilla boarding the plane.  The relationship is semantically related, but not visually or textually identical.

The image shows a stylized graphic, seemingly political in nature, featuring a map of California partially overlaid with the Mexican flag.  There's text present, but it's not legible enough to definitively determine its meaning from the provided resolution.

The claim, however, makes a specific assertion about the Governor of California issuing a strong warning to Donald Trump regarding immigration policy and potential Californian secession. This claim involves specific individuals (the Governor and Trump), a specific policy (immigration deportation), and a specific consequence (California seceding and joining Mexico).

The image lacks any of these specific elements.  While it hints at a potential California-Mexico connection through the visual merging of their respective flags, it doesn't depict either Trump or the California governor, nor does it explicitly mention immigration or secession. The visual suggestion of a political statement is too vague and lacks the crucial specific details present in the claim.

Therefore, the low similarity score is likely due to:

* **Absence of key individuals:** The claim names specific political figures.  The image contains no recognizable imagery of them.
* **Lack of explicit policy mention:** The claim centers on immigration deportation. The image offers no direct visual representation of this policy.
* **Vague representation of secession:** The image's visual merging of flags suggests a connection, but doesn't explicitly state California's secession or joining Mexico. It's open to multiple interpretations, not just the specific one in the claim.
* **Low image resolution and illegible text:** The poor quality of the image makes it impossible to confirm whether the text supports the claim.  Unreadable text contributes to the lack of concrete connection.

In summary, the image provides a general visual theme potentially related to California and Mexico, but it fails to capture the specific details and actors involved in the claim, resulting in the low similarity score and ""Unrelated"" classification.  The claim's specificity contrasts sharply with the image's ambiguity.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.31 suggests a weak but detectable relationship. This relatively low score indicates that the connection isn't strong. The relationship is likely based on the following:

This shared subject matter provides a basis for the relationship, even if the content of the statements differs significantly.

Both the genuine quote and the fabricated quote touch upon the contentious topic of immigration and the narratives surrounding it.

* **Contextual Understanding (Limited):** CLIP, as a vision-language model, likely lacks the nuanced understanding of political context needed to fully grasp the fabrication.  It identifies the shared elements, but doesn't weigh their importance or understand the deceitful nature of the image.  It simply sees visual and textual similarity in the subject matter, regardless of the accuracy or truthfulness.

The low similarity score (0.31) reflects the significant difference between the accurate quote emphasizing confusion and the fabricated quote portraying aggressive intent.

Musk, who has taken a leading role in President Donald Trump’s administration, has criticized U.S. aid to Ukraine and elsewhere. Leading the Department of Government Efficiency, a nongovernmental advisory board that Trump tasked with cutting federal costs, Musk has gained access to the U.S. Treasury’s payment system and is working to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development, an independent government organization codified in law that provides humanitarian and disaster aid abroad. 
A freeze on most foreign assistance has not stopped U.S. military aid to Ukraine, Zelenskyy said Jan. 25. But humanitarian organizations in Ukraine have had to halt services as their funding has stopped.
Here’s why claims of money laundering in Ukraine don’t hold up. 
Congressional funding
Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Congress has passed five bills to aid Ukraine’s war effort, totalling nearly $175 billion. Executive action and supplemental appropriations have provided additional funding. 
That money was not wired directly to Ukraine’s government, though. A Council on Foreign Relations breakdown shows that out of the $175 billion Congress has appropriated, about $100 billion worth of aid is being sent to Ukraine. The rest is funding U.S. activities associated with the war and other countries in the region, the Council on Foreign Relations said. 
The aid to Ukraine comes mostly as weapons shipments and other military support. Only about $33 billion was dedicated to direct budget support, the Council on Foreign Relations reported. About $70 billion of the value going directly to Ukraine is in weapons, equipment and other military support. 
A large portion of the money to support Ukraine’s war effort is spent in the U.S., Mark Cancian, an analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank said in a 2023 analysis: It is going to domestic weapons manufacturers to produce weapons for Ukraine and to replace equipment that was already sent from American stockpiles. 
""Funding of US agencies, most of the funding for US military forces, most of the military equipment backfill and Ukrainian equipment purchases, and a part of the humanitarian assistance stay in the United States,"" Cancian said in the 2023 article.
Also, not all of the money dedicated for Ukraine has been spent yet, and Zelenskyy in the circulated video appeared to be discussing the funding the country has received to date. According to the Special Inspector General for Operation Atlantic Resolve, the multiagency watchdog that oversees Ukraine funding, $86.7 billion of the $130 billion obligated to Ukraine had been disbursed by Sept. 30, 2024. 
What Zelenskyy said
In the AP interview, Zelenskyy said the actual military assistance Ukraine has received to fight the war is lower than the top-line dollar figure in the aid packages.
The AP has posted portions of the interview, but Zelenskyy’s office posted the full hourlong video on its YouTube page in Ukrainian. A clip from that interview spread on social media with English captions. The video has a label from ""@Smotri_Media,"" a Russian Telegram group.  
In the clip’s English translation, Zelenskyy said that the country received ""just over"" $75 billion in military aid. He noted that areas other than the military received U.S. aid.

By Maria Briceño • February 5, 2025
""One-hundred billion (dollars) of these 177, or 200, some people even say, we have never received,"" Zelenskyy said, according to the translation of the clip. ""We are talking about specific things, because we got it not with money but with weapons. We got $70 something billion worth of it. There is training, there is additional transport. There are not only prices for weapons, there were humanitarian programs, social et cetera.""
It was not clear what exactly Zelenskyy was including in his accounting of the military support Ukraine has received, but his comments align with the public data on how Ukraine aid is being spent. 
The money is not missing or laundered, as some posts claimed. It’s being spent as Congress intended: on U.S. weapons manufacturing, nonmilitary support in Ukraine and support elsewhere in the region.
That’s not to say that Ukrainian aid is never misappropriated. In 2024, Ukraine’s security services investigated Ukrainian defense officials over alleged corruption in a $40 million arms purchase. But Zelenskyy’s statements aren’t evidence of widespread fraud or money laundering in Ukraine aid. 
Inspectors general from the Defense and State departments and the U.S. Agency for International Development have overseen Ukraine aid and have published dozens of audits and assessments of funding programs since 2022. Their review has uncovered no widespread abuse of aid to Ukraine. The U.S. State Department said in August ""there remains no credible evidence of illicit diversion of U.S.-provided defense equipment, direct budget support, or humanitarian assistance from Ukraine.""
The Fraud and Corruption Investigative Working Group, under the special inspector general for Ukraine oversight, opened 61 investigations and closed 30 of them from July to September 2024. 
Our ruling
Social media posts claimed that Zelenskyy ""threw the whole Ukraine money laundering operation under the bus.""
Zelenskyy said Ukraine has received only about $75 billion in military assistance of the $175 billion the U.S. has dedicated to Ukraine aid. That’s in line with what researchers monitoring funding to Ukraine have observed.
A large portion of the money stayed in the U.S. and a smaller portion went to other countries in the region.

Crucially, there is **no visible textual or contextual information** in the image itself that directly relates to the claim of significant aid discrepancies or accusations of money laundering.

The claim focuses on a specific numerical assertion ($177 billion in aid, less than half received) and a serious allegation of money laundering.  The image, however, simply depicts Zelenskyy.  It lacks any reference to:

* **Specific sums of money:**  There are no numbers, figures, or graphs visible in the image related to the claimed $177 billion.
* **Allegations of money laundering:** The image contains no visual cues suggesting any illicit financial activity.
* **US aid:** There is nothing in the image indicating a connection to US assistance to Ukraine.

CLIP's function is to compare the visual content of an image to the semantic meaning of a textual description.  Because the image provides only a portrait of Zelenskyy, devoid of any elements relevant to the specifics of the claim, the model correctly identifies a lack of connection.  The low similarity score reflects the significant gap between the highly specific and accusatory nature of the claim and the general, uninformative nature of the image. The image is merely a picture; it offers no visual support or refutation for the claim.

The image shows a *still photograph of wreckage*, specifically debris scattered on the ground,  with no discernible aircraft, helicopter, or even clear indication of the type of vehicle involved in the accident.

Here's a breakdown of why the low similarity score and ""Unrelated"" classification are appropriate:

* **Absence of Aircraft:** The image lacks any visible portion of a plane or helicopter. There are no recognizable fuselage parts, wings, rotors, or tail sections that would suggest an aircraft crash.  The debris is too fragmented to definitively identify the origin.

* **Ambiguous Debris:** The scattered debris consists of relatively small pieces and is not easily identifiable.  It could originate from any number of vehicles or even non-vehicular sources.  The lack of context makes determining the cause of the accident or the type of vehicle involved impossible from just this image alone.

* **Lack of Context:** The photograph provides no broader context. There are no buildings, landmarks, or geographical features that could place it in Washington D.C. or anywhere else.  The scale of the debris field is unclear.

* **Low Resolution and Quality:** The resolution of the image may also contribute to the low similarity score.  Poor image quality makes detailed analysis and object recognition difficult for the AI.

* **Mismatch of Claim and Visual Data:** The claim specifically mentions an ""airplane crash with helicopter.""  The image shows neither a plane nor a helicopter, and doesn't even clearly suggest a crash involving any specific type of aircraft.  This fundamental mismatch between the claim and the visual data leads to the low similarity score.

In essence, the image is a generic depiction of wreckage, offering insufficient information to support the claim of a specific airplane and helicopter crash in Washington D.C.  The low similarity score reflects the AI's correct assessment of this lack of correspondence.  The image requires significant additional context and information before any meaningful connection can be made to the claim.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a low similarity score (0.27) is understandable given the disconnect between the image and the claim.  The relationship is tenuous at best.

Here's a breakdown of why the score is low despite the ""Related"" classification:

* **The Claim Focuses on Allegations of Corruption:** The claim centers on a specific accusation: Ukrainian officials releasing a list of alleged bribes paid to 18 US politicians. This points towards a narrative of potential wrongdoing and political influence.

* **The Image Depicts a Friendly Diplomatic Encounter:** The image depicts a seemingly cordial meeting between the presidents of Ukraine and the United States. It conveys an image of cooperation and diplomatic relations, entirely separate from the accusations of bribery.  There's no visible indication of illicit activity.

* **Low Similarity Score Reflects the Weak Connection:** The low similarity score (0.27) reflects the lack of direct visual connection between the image's content and the claim's assertion.  The image doesn't visually support or contradict the claim; it simply shows a diplomatic handshake.  The connection is solely contextual – both relate to the US-Ukraine relationship.

* **Contextual Relationship, Not Visual:** The relationship is established through context: both the claim and the image relate to the interaction between the US and Ukrainian governments. However, this is a weak connection for image analysis.  CLIP relies on visual features, and the image lacks any visual cues related to bribery, lists, or the named politicians.

In summary, CLIP likely classified the image as ""Related"" because both the image and the claim involve the US-Ukraine relationship.  However, the low similarity score accurately reflects the weak visual connection. The image is primarily about a diplomatic meeting, while the claim is about alleged corruption.  The connection is purely based on the shared context, not visual similarities detected by CLIP.

The claim ""Elon Musk shocks the world by blocking Pride on X forever: ‘Children must come first.’” asserts that Elon Musk has taken an action directly antagonistic to LGBTQ+ representation on the platform X (formerly Twitter).  The claim implies a specific policy change banning Pride-related content.

CLIP classified the image as 'Unrelated' with a low similarity score (0.18) because there's no visual connection between the image's content and the claim's assertion.  The image is positive and celebratory, associated with LGBTQ+ pride. The claim, however, describes a negative action – a ban on such content.  There's no depiction of a ban, censorship, or any Musk-related imagery. The image displays a message of peace and inclusivity, completely at odds with the alleged action of censorship described in the claim.

The low similarity score reflects this stark contrast.  The model likely analyzed the image's visual features (rainbow, heart, peace sign) and associated them with positive, LGBTQ+ themed messaging.  These features have little to no semantic overlap with the claim's description of a ban and thus the low score and 'Unrelated' classification.  The model doesn't understand the context of a potential policy change on a social media platform; it only processes the visual features against the textual description of the claim.  Therefore, the lack of visual representation of the claimed action leads to the low similarity and ""Unrelated"" judgment.

Ashley Moody, R-Fla., said at a hearing that a human trafficking tip line stopped reporting cases to law enforcement.

Moody joined fellow lawmakers on the Senate Judiciary Committee to question President Donald Trump’s pick for FBI director, Kash Patel, during his Jan. 30 confirmation hearing.

""It might shock you to know that the National Human Trafficking Hotline that was funded by Congress to report tips to law enforcement, in the last four years decided that they would no longer report tips to law enforcement, that they would take a more victim-centered approach,"" Moody said. ""This fell in line with a lot of what we saw over the last four years, with people saying things like, defund the police, abolish the police, nonsense policies that lead to an explosion in crime.""

In 2024, Moody worked with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to launch a statewide human trafficking tip line after concerns the national hotline was failing to give tips to local law enforcement in a timely way.
PolitiFact found no announcements from the National Human Trafficking Hotline signaling any reporting policy shift over the last four years. The only mention of a potential change came in a 2023 letter that multiple state attorneys general, including Moody, signed that recounted comments from a hotline executive who said the service was ""beginning to transition away"" from serving as a tip line.
Rafael Avalos, a spokesperson for the hotline’s parent company, told PolitiFact in an email that the service has not changed its reporting policies. 
""The instances in which the National Human Trafficking Hotline reports to law enforcement have remained consistent for more than 10 years,"" Avalos wrote.
The hotline says it reports tips to law enforcement and prioritizes obtaining victims’ consent before alerting authorities. The organization, on its website, said it alerts authorities, with or without victim consent, in cases involving imminent harm, child sex abuse or when required by law.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
PolitiFact emailed Moody’s office for evidence but received no reply.
The national hotline’s origins
The National Human Trafficking Hotline was born out of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, a federal law that recognized human trafficking as a crime. Its mandate is to connect human trafficking victims with social services and notify police about potential trafficking ""as requested or required by law"" within 24 hours, according to grant materials The Washington Post cited.
Polaris Project, a nonprofit organization working to reduce sex and labor trafficking in North America, has run the service since 2007. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and private donors fund it.
Federal law requires that the hotline’s phone number be posted in all federal buildings, at every port of entry and in airport, bus station and train station restrooms.

The hotline’s website outlines how the organization decides when to report to authorities. It says the organization ""respects an individual's right to make the decision regarding whether or not to report information about his/her experience to law enforcement or other parties,"" and recognizes that informing law enforcement ""can lead to increased investigations and prosecutions, deter future trafficking, and help victims safely exit situations of human trafficking.""

""Whenever possible, the Trafficking Hotline endeavors to speak directly with victims to discuss the various reporting and referral options and receive explicit consent to make a report on his/her behalf,"" the FAQ page says. ""Consent from a victim and the safety of any individuals involved are the most important factors the Trafficking Hotline considers when weighing whether or not to make a report.""
In a 2020 grant application that The Washington Post reviewed, the Health and Human Services Department wrote that the hotline ""must defer to the individual seeking assistance on if, and when, to report their case to law enforcement, unless required to do otherwise by state-mandated child welfare reporting requirements.""

Other hotlines, such as the National Sexual Abuse Hotline, operate similarly. They keep calls from adult victims confidential and allow victims to decide whether to involve police. 
The hotline received more than 30,000 calls, texts and emails in 2023, according to Polaris data and identified 7,380 unique cases of potential human trafficking. The organization said it refers about a third of those potential cases to police.
Attorneys general claims of recent reporting change
The claim about a recent reporting change could stem from a 2022 meeting between Republican Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch and Polaris CEO Catherine Chen. 

Thirty-six attorneys general signed a 2023 letter to congressional leaders that mentioned the meeting.

""It has recently come to our attention that the National Human Trafficking Hotline (""Hotline""), which Congress has funded for 15 years, is not reporting tips of adult trafficking to state law enforcement except under the limited circumstance where the victim self-reports and affirmatively consents to the Hotline making the report,"" the letter says. ""Not only do we believe this action contravenes one of Congress’ intended functions of the Hotline, but we believe it disrupts the federal-state partnership to end human trafficking and help its victims.""

The letter said Fitch expressed concern during the meeting with Chen about what she said was a lack of tips to Mississippi authorities from the hotline. The letter said Chen told Fitch the hotline takes a victim-centered approach that weighs potential adverse consequences to victims, and that it ""was beginning to transition away from serving as a tip line to concentrate more on connecting survivors with resources.""

PolitiFact asked Fitch for data showing the number of reports Mississippi law enforcement received from tips but received no reply. We found no data on the hotline’s website or elsewhere that details the number of hotline tips reported to law enforcement over the years. 
Fitch’s office told The Washington Post in July 2023 that a 2021 case drew attention to the issue. The Post reported that a man called the hotline after hearing from an out-of-state friend who needed help and the hotline said it couldn’t do anything. Fitch’s office told the newspaper it was alarmed to learn that many third-party tips are not referred to police. 
In interviews with The Post, Polaris acknowledged delays in sharing information received via email and webchats, which they said are intended for ""nonurgent communications,"" during a three-month period of staffing shortages in 2022. But the organization pushed back on other criticism.

In a March 2023 response to the attorneys general letter, Polaris said that concerns raised about its reporting practices were based on a misunderstanding of the hotline’s mission.

""The Trafficking Hotline is not primarily a law enforcement tip line, but rather is authorized by Congress and funded by HHS to ‘assist victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons in communicating with service providers,’"" the statement said.

The hotline ""works with victims to determine what they need to begin to break free and rebuild their lives,"" the statement said. ""This is important because traffickers take consent, choice, and freedom away from victims.""

Polaris said it ""actively partner(s) with hundreds of law enforcement agencies all over the country to ensure countless traffickers are arrested and justice is served.""

In April 2023, U.S. Reps. Laurel M. Lee, R-Fla., and Kathy Castor, D-Fla., introduced the National Human Trafficking Hotline Enhancement Act that would compel the hotline to provide information from calls to law enforcement on request. The bill made it through committee but never got consideration on the House floor. 
PolitiFact asked Polaris whether the attorneys general letter accurately represented Chen’s comments, and if Chen had been describing a policy shift when she met with Fitch. Polaris pointed us to the 2023 Washington Post story with comments from Chen.

""We believe law enforcement has to be part of the solution,"" The Post quotes Chen as saying. ""But this idea that you can mandate that the hotline report every single bit of information whenever it is that law enforcement wants it fundamentally reverses the trust that we’re trying to build with victims and survivors. And they will absolutely stop calling us."" 
Our ruling
Moody said the National Human Trafficking Hotline decided in the last four years to ""no longer report tips to law enforcement"" and to take a more victim-centered approach.
The hotline says it reports tips to law enforcement authorities but prioritizes obtaining victims’ consent first. The organization also alerts authorities, with or without victim consent, in cases involving imminent harm, child sex abuse, or when required by law. The organization said it consistently refers about one-third of human trafficking victims to law enforcement.
PolitiFact found no announcements that signaled a reporting policy change over the last four years. A hotline spokesperson said its policies have remained consistent for more than a decade.
Moody provided no evidence to back her claim.
At PolitiFact, the burden of proof is on the speaker. Lacking evidence to support the claim, we rate it False.

There are other individuals in the background, also appearing attentive.  The image contains no visible text directly related to the National Human Trafficking Hotline, victim-centered approaches, law enforcement reporting, or any timeframe.

The claim, on the other hand, focuses on a specific policy change within a particular organization (the Hotline) regarding its interaction with law enforcement over a defined period (the last four years).  The image provides absolutely no visual context or evidence related to this claim.  There's no mention of the Hotline, no representation of its internal processes or decision-making, no individuals identifiable as being connected to the Hotline, and no visual representation of data or policy documents.

The lack of any visual elements connecting the image to the claim is the primary reason for the low similarity score. The image's context is purely generic—a formal speaking event—while the claim is highly specific to a particular organization's internal operations and policy shift.  The CLIP model correctly identifies this lack of overlap and appropriately labels the relationship as ""Unrelated.""  The low score further emphasizes the absence of any shared semantic meaning between the image and the assertion.

Birthright citizenship refers to the constitutional guarantee, laid out in the 14th Amendment, that all children born in the United States is automatically a U.S. citizen, even if their parents are in the country illegally.
As one of his first acts in office, Trump signed an executive order aiming to end automatic citizenship for children born in the U.S. if neither their mother or father is a U.S. citizen or a lawful permanent resident. The order was immediately challenged in court, and a federal judge temporarily blocked it. The Trump administration has promised to appeal. 
Many Republicans, including members of Congress from Wisconsin, have backed Trump’s position on reinterpreting birthright citizenship.
That includes U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., who discussed the topic Jan. 26 on WISN-TV’s Sunday morning show ""Upfront.""

""We’re one of the very few nations that allowed birthright citizenship,"" Johnson said. ""It’s kind of crazy that this is the policy of the United States.""
""I’m not sure the people passing the 14th Amendment would anticipate wide open borders and this flood of illegal immigrants coming uncontrolled into this country, somewhat incentivized by birthright citizenship,"" he said.
Johnson has previously expressed support for ending birthright citizenship, including at a Senate hearing in December. Then, he said the U.S. is in the ""minority"" of countries that grant it.
With so much attention on birthright citizenship, PolitiFact Wisconsin thought Johnson’s claim was interesting. Is the U.S. an outlier in offering automatic citizenship to children born here?

PolitiFact National checked a similar claim from Trump earlier in January, when he falsely said the U.S. is the only country with birthright citizenship. 
About three dozen countries offer automatic citizenship to people born in the country, without restrictions. Countries with restrictions, for example, might require one parent to be born there or a citizen.
We presented the 35 number to Johnson’s office and asked for evidence and context to back up his statement. His spokeswoman, Kiersten Pels, noted that ""35 of 195 (total countries) is only 18 percent of countries.""
""Additionally, Canada and the U.S. are the only two ""developed"" nations (according to IMF) to allow it,"" she said.
That refers to the International Monetary Fund’s distinction between countries with ""advanced economies,"" such as the U.S. and Canada, versus ""emerging and developing economies."" 
Other populous countries that provide unrestricted birthright citizenship, but are under the IMF’s ""emerging and developing"" category, include Mexico and Brazil.

Interestingly, nearly all countries that offer it are in North America, South America or the Caribbean: A product of colonial times, when immigration was encouraged to populate settlements in the ""New World.""

Some countries have recently done away with unrestricted birthright citizenship and added conditions, including Ireland in 2005 and New Zealand in 2006. 
Our ruling
Johnson said the U.S. is one of a ""very few"" nations with birthright citizenship. 
Thirty-five nations have it, but ""very few"" is a pretty subjective number when compared to 195 total countries. PolitiFact Wisconsin took that into account when rating the claim. 
Johnson’s initial claim was True when he said the U.S. is in the ""minority"" of countries that offer it — if 18 percent of countries have it, that’s certainly not a majority. 
But the U.S. isn’t an anomaly either, at least on this side of the world. Canada and Mexico, two very large countries next to the U.S., both have birthright citizenship. 
Our definition of Mostly True is ""the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.""

The central focus is DeSantis himself, his podium, and a partially visible audience.  There's nothing in the image directly related to birthright citizenship, its history, its legal implementation in the US, or comparative data on other nations' policies regarding citizenship.

The claim ""We’re one of the very few nations that allowed birthright citizenship"" is a statement about legal and historical policy, requiring contextual understanding of national laws and international comparisons. The image, however, is purely a visual depiction of a political event.  There are no textual elements referencing birthright citizenship, no charts or graphs depicting comparative data, and no visual symbols that could be interpreted as representing the concept.

Therefore, the CLIP model's classification of ""Unrelated"" with a similarity score of 0.23 is entirely justified.  The low similarity score reflects the significant semantic gap between the purely visual content of the image (a politician at a rally) and the abstract concept expressed in the claim (a comparison of national citizenship laws).  CLIP is likely basing its assessment on the lack of visual overlap between the image's features and any conceptual representation of birthright citizenship.  The model doesn't interpret the context of DeSantis's presence or his potential political stances. It simply compares the visual features directly, finding no relevant connection.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.25 suggests a weak connection, reflecting the image's limited ability to support or refute the claim directly.  Let's break down why the score is low despite the apparent relevance:

* **Lack of Evidence for Remote Control:** The image shows only the aftermath of the crash.  There's nothing visible that suggests remote control operation—no visible antennas, control boxes, or other technological elements associated with remote piloting.  The wreckage itself offers no clues about the cause of the crash.

* **Generic Nature of the Image:** The image is a generic depiction of helicopter wreckage.  It could represent a crash caused by various factors, including mechanical failure, pilot error, or indeed, remote control malfunction (though the latter is not visually evident). The image doesn't specifically point to any aspect related to remote control.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The 0.25 score indicates a weak relationship. CLIP likely associates the image with the claim primarily because it depicts a Black Hawk helicopter crash, a subject directly relevant to the claim. However, the image provides no visual evidence to support or contradict the assertion of remote control.  The score reflects this lack of direct visual corroboration.

* **Contextual Information Missing:** The image alone lacks crucial contextual information.  Investigative reports, flight data recorders, witness testimonies, etc., are necessary to determine whether remote control was involved.  The image only provides visual data related to the event's outcome, not its cause.

In summary, the image is relevant to the claim in the sense that it depicts the subject of the claim (a Black Hawk helicopter crash). However, it lacks any visual evidence to support or contradict the specific assertion of remote control.  Therefore, the low similarity score from CLIP is justified, indicating a weak, contextual relationship rather than a strong visual correlation.

The low similarity score of 0.25 from CLIP, despite the classification as 'Related', indicates a weak connection.  This is because the relationship is primarily one of *refutation* rather than direct visual similarity.

The image itself doesn't visually depict 1,500 IRS agents resigning.  Instead, it presents a *debunking* of the claim.  The key elements are:

* **Text:** The image prominently features text stating the claim is ""FALSE"" and providing context about the misleading graphic's origin and spread. This text directly addresses the claim in question.

* **Graphic within the Image:** The image includes a screenshot of the *false* graphic that initially spread the rumor. This graphic is visually similar to the kind of image one might expect to accompany a news story about mass resignations, using charts and potentially misleading visuals to support the false claim.

* **Politifact Branding:** The Politifact logo adds another layer of context. This visually signals that the image's purpose is fact-checking and debunking misinformation, rather than direct representation of the claim.

Therefore, CLIP's ""Related"" classification with a low score is likely due to the image's *indirect* relationship to the claim. The image doesn't visually depict the claim itself, but rather a visual representation of the *denial* and *refutation* of the claim.  The low similarity score reflects the absence of direct visual correspondence.  The connection lies in the semantic relationship: the image directly confronts and counters the claim, making it relevant, though not visually similar in a straightforward way.  The visual elements are primarily textual and focused on debunking, not directly illustrating the claim's alleged events.

The low score indicates that the relationship isn't strong, and further analysis reveals why.

The image likely depicts a news collage related to a police investigation or manhunt.  While the precise content isn't available without viewing the image directly (the URL is not accessible to me), assuming it's a typical news collage as suggested by the file name, the reasoning behind the ""Related"" classification, albeit weak, could be based on several factors:

* **Presence of Police Officers:** If the image shows police officers (possibly female, though this is crucial detail missing), this would contribute to the similarity. The claim mentions the killing of female police officers, so any visual representation of police officers could be weakly connected.
* **News Graphics/Layout:** News graphics related to police investigations often feature similar visual elements (maps, mugshots, police vehicles, etc.).  The generic nature of these visual elements could lead to a weak association with the claim even without specific details matching.
* **Ambiguous Faces:** If the collage includes photos of suspects, even if not explicitly labeled as Hispanic,  the model might make a tenuous connection based on generalized facial features.  However, this is a highly unreliable and potentially biased source of connection.
* **Textual Elements:**  Any visible text (news headlines, captions) in the collage could contribute to the similarity.  If any text relates to a crime, a manhunt, or involves an investigation involving a couple (even without explicitly mentioning ethnicity), it could slightly increase the similarity score.

**Why the score is so low (0.29):**

The low similarity score is crucial. It indicates that the image lacks strong visual elements directly supporting the claim.  The connection is likely based on superficial similarities, rather than a direct match. The absence of crucial information (e.g., confirmation of the ethnicity of suspects, the number of victims being female officers, a clear depiction of the event) severely weakens the link.

In conclusion, the CLIP model likely identified some superficial visual cues common in news reports about police investigations and crimes. The low similarity score strongly suggests that there is no strong visual evidence in the image to corroborate the specific details of the claim. The model might be connecting unrelated elements due to shared contextual information within a typical news report, emphasizing the importance of careful interpretation of similarity scores, especially in sensitive contexts like this one. The model's weak connection highlights the potential for bias and misinterpretation inherent in relying solely on image analysis without careful contextual understanding.

Trump mentioned neither Nigeria, immigration nor visas during the speech. He did mention U.S. borders several times, saying ""we’re going to fix our borders"" and ""we’re going to have to seal up those borders.""

We rate its claims False.",FALSE,image_56.jpg,https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2513930/donald-trump.webp?w=790&f=e62f53ff0ad08ccfe7e38b791673ac03,Related,0.2651038467884063,"The image from Newsweek shows a portrait-style photograph of Donald Trump.  The similarity score of 0.27 between the image and the claim ""Video shows 'Donald Trump just announced that America will no longer give visas to Nigerians'"" is relatively low, suggesting a weak relationship.  The low score is justified given the lack of direct evidence in the image itself to support the claim.

Here's a breakdown of why the relationship is weak, despite the CLIP model's ""Related"" classification:

* **Absence of contextual information:** The image is simply a picture of Donald Trump. It contains no text, no accompanying video footage, and no visual elements that directly refer to a visa policy announcement concerning Nigerians.  The image provides only a visual representation of the individual named in the claim.

* **Low CLIP score:** The score of 0.27 indicates a weak correlation.  CLIP's assessment likely stems from the presence of Donald Trump, who is directly mentioned in the claim. The model recognizes the visual match between the image and the textual description, but fails to recognize the absence of any visual support for the claim's specific content.

* **Potential for misinterpretation:** The claim mentions a video that allegedly shows the announcement. The image is a still photograph, not a video.  The CLIP model might be associating the image with the claim simply because Trump is the subject of both.  It doesn't process the crucial difference between a photograph and a video containing such an announcement.

* **Lack of visual cues:**  There are no objects, symbols, or text elements in the image that would hint at any immigration policy, Nigerian citizens, or a significant public announcement. The image offers no visual context to support or refute the claim.

In summary, the ""Related"" classification with a low similarity score reflects a superficial connection:  the image contains the individual mentioned in the claim. However, it offers no evidence to support the claim's content regarding a specific policy announcement towards Nigerians.  A higher score would be expected if the image showed Trump speaking at a press conference, a video still image containing text related to the claim, or other visual elements directly supporting the claim. The low score accurately reflects the absence of such supportive visual context.

The claim directly mentions both individuals and their purportedly strained relationship stemming from a specific event.

The low similarity score (0.28) reflects the weak connection. The image depicts a seemingly positive interaction between the two, contradicting the claim's assertion of Trump's fury. There's no visual evidence in the photo supporting the claim's narrative of conflict related to the FAA and SpaceX. The image only shows the two men together; it provides no context about their feelings towards each other or about any specific events.

The CLIP model likely identifies the shared presence of Trump and Musk as the primary reason for the ""Related"" classification.  It's a weak connection, purely based on the individuals involved, not on the content of the claim. The model doesn't understand the nuances of the claim – the alleged anger, the FAA involvement, the SpaceX fine – and solely relies on identifying the key named entities within the image and the text.  The low score suggests CLIP recognizes this weak link and doesn't strongly associate the image's positive visual with the negative narrative of the claim.  A higher similarity score would have implied a stronger visual corroboration of the claim's content, which is absent here.  Essentially, the relationship is based on the superficial presence of the named entities rather than a meaningful connection to the claim's central conflict.

The low similarity score reinforces this weak connection.

Here's a breakdown of why the classification is weak:

* **Lack of Specific Details:** The image lacks crucial details to confirm the claim.  We cannot identify the men in suits as immigration officers with certainty. Their attire is consistent with various government roles.  More importantly, the shirt worn by the man being approached is not visible, making it impossible to confirm the ""Latinos for Trump 2024"" detail. The interaction seems formal but doesn't clearly depict an arrest.

* **Ambiguous Interaction:** The image shows an interaction, but the nature of the interaction is unclear. It could be an arrest, a questioning, or simply a formal discussion.  There are no visible handcuffs, weapons drawn, or other obvious signs of an arrest in progress.

* **Visual Similarity, Not Semantic Similarity:**  The CLIP model likely registered a ""Related"" classification due to visual similarities: multiple people interacting, men in suits, a formal setting.  However, this is a superficial similarity.  The semantic meaning—the specific details of the claim—is largely missing from the image.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The score of 0.29 indicates a low degree of similarity.  This is a crucial piece of information.  A higher score would suggest a stronger relationship, while a low score, as in this case, indicates a weak or possibly incorrect association.

In conclusion, while the image depicts a scene with some superficial visual similarities to the claim, it lacks the crucial details (identification of immigration officers and the specific shirt) to support the claim. The low similarity score from CLIP accurately reflects this lack of strong connection between the image and the claim.  More information would be needed to confirm or deny the claim.

"Donald Trump
stated on January 30, 2025 in a press briefing:",“I changed the Obama policy (on hiring air traffic controllers) ... And then Biden came in and he changed it.”,"stated on January 30, 2025 in a press briefing:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/jan/31/donald-trump/trump-faults-dei-hiring-in-plane-crash-and-falsely/,,"Hours after a plane crashed over the Potomac River a few miles from the White House, President Donald Trump held a press briefing in which he blamed his predecessors’ diversity hiring policies as a possible reason for the accident.
Sixty-seven people were presumed dead after an American Airlines passenger jet collided in midair with a U.S. Army helicopter near the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport on Jan. 29. The victims included three U.S. service members aboard the helicopter and everyone aboard the plane, including several young figure skaters, a civil rights lawyer, a newlywed, a pilot and several flight attendants. 
Trump started his Jan. 30 press conference with a moment of silence but pivoted to blame Democratic Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, who Trump said led Federal Aviation Administration diversity programs that inspired the agency to hire unqualified air traffic control employees. Trump said he ended those initiatives in 2017 when he was first elected, but Biden reinstated them.
""I changed the Obama policy, and we had a very good policy,"" Trump said. ""And then Biden came in and he changed it. And then when I came in two days, three days ago, I signed a new order, bringing it to the highest level of intelligence.""
Trump read from a Fox News headline that said the Federal Aviation Administration diversity hiring initiative ""includes focus on hiring people with severe intellectual and psychiatric disabilities."" Trump said it came out a week before he took office, but it was published Jan. 14, 2024. After the press conference, the White House also pointed to an Obama-era biographical assessment for air traffic controllers that critics said prioritized diversity over skills.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
A close look at the FAA’s hiring policies under Obama, Biden and Trump shows that Trump mischaracterized the policies and misled about his actions and the actions of his White House predecessors. He also provided no evidence these policies had any connection to the fatal crash.
The crash has generated renewed concerns about air traffic controller staffing, and the cause remains under investigation. Experts warned against singling out any specific cause of the crash, including diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, less than 24 hours after it occurred. 
Trump expanded — not withdrew — a hiring initiative aimed at people with disabilities
In 2010, Obama’s administration issued an executive order directing federal agencies to hire more people with disabilities, noting that although 54 million people in the U.S. have disabilities, they were underrepresented in the federal workforce. The FAA incorporated the directive into its hiring practices.
That didn’t stop when Trump took office in 2017. Archives of the FAA’s website show the agency continually highlighted its diversity hiring initiatives, including its aims to hire people with disabilities, from 2013 up until Trump reclaimed office in 2025, including throughout Trump’s first term, 2017 to 2021. The page was taken down after Trump was inaugurated Jan. 20.
During his Jan. 30 press conference, Trump maligned a list of ""targeted disabilities,"" including severe intellectual disabilities, saying their emphasis in hiring was unique to his predecessors.  
The term ""targeted disabilities"" is legally defined across the federal government to include ""hearing, vision, missing extremities, partial paralysis, complete paralysis, epilepsy, severe intellectual disability, psychiatric disability and dwarfism.""
Yet in 2019, also under Trump’s first term, the FAA launched a program that aimed to hire 20 people with disabilities to be air traffic controllers, including people who have these ""targeted disabilities.""
In its April 11, 2019, press release, the agency said the program’s key focus was to ""identify specific opportunities for people with targeted disabilities, empower them and facilitate their entry into a more diverse and inclusive workforce.""
After being sworn in for his second term, Trump on Jan. 20 and Jan. 22 signed executive orders aimed at shutting down diversity programs in the federal government, including the FAA. 
The White House confirmed Jan. 30 that Trump’s executive orders did away with those goals.  
Trump ended a controversial Obama-era hiring protocol, but Biden did not reinstate it
In 2014, the Obama administration launched a hiring assessment for air traffic controllers that weighed biographical information such as work and education experience and personality traits as part of a person’s application. The training standards for those who were hired didn’t change.
The assessment did not ask specifically about race, but critics said it was designed to create a more diverse hiring pool at the expense of people who were more qualified or performed better on skills tests. People who failed were not allowed to continue with their application. The FAA introduced the assessment into its hiring protocol in 2014 after it commissioned a study of the barriers racial minorities and women face in becoming air traffic controllers.
Throughout his first term, the Trump administration defended the Transportation Department in a lawsuit over the assessment, which plaintiffs said was discriminatory. Trump’s administration and Biden’s administration both denied in court that the process favored nonwhite applicants. Nevertheless, in 2018, Trump jettisoned its use of the air control biographical assessment, the White House said.
Biden’s administration did not reinstate the assessment, and it has not been a part of the application process since 2018.

All air traffic controllers need to pass skills and medical tests to be hired, air traffic management experts told PolitiFact. That didn’t change under either hiring initiative. 
Some disabilities could be disqualifying, Margaret Wallace, an aviation management professor at Florida Institute of Technology, said. Some examples could include heart conditions or neurological issues that might unexpectedly incapacitate a person, or ""poor or no vision, color blindness, poor or no hearing, speech issues that could affect the ability to communicate as needed,"" Wallace said.
Michael McCormick retired from the FAA in 2015 after working under Republican and Democrat administrations, and his work included hiring controllers. He said most of the conditions Trump listed would not meet the agency’s medical standards. 
""The decision to hire a controller is solely based upon aptitude testing, medical certification and security investigation,"" McCormick said. 
Our ruling
As he speculated about the Jan. 29 air crash’s cause, Trump said ""I changed the Obama policy (on hiring air traffic controllers) ... And then Biden came in and he changed it.""
The White House said he was referring to two separate policies. 
The first was a push to hire more people with disabilities that started under Obama. Trump didn’t end the initiative — he expanded the effort by announcing a program aimed at hiring 20 people with disabilities to be air traffic controllers. All air traffic controllers had to pass medical, security and skills tests, regardless of any disability.
The second involved an Obama-era hiring assessment that critics said prioritized diversity over qualifications. Trump was wrong to say that Biden reinstated it — he did not. The assessment has not been in place since 2018, when Trump ended it. But even under that practice, training standards did not change.
Trump conflated policies, obfuscated about his role in them and misled about what they did.
Investigators are still piecing together what led to the crash, a process that could take months. Trump’s leap to connect these policies to what unfolded over the Potomac has no basis.
We rate the claim False.",FALSE,image_59.jpg,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/AP25030829073446/aca7c08c125a0566139e268e8ae90539.jpg,Unrelated,0.2070770859718322,"The Politifact image shows a graph depicting the number of air traffic controller hires over time, with distinct upward and downward trends.  The claim, however, focuses on a policy *change* under Obama and then Biden, not the raw numbers of hires themselves.  This is the key disconnect that leads to the ""Unrelated"" classification by CLIP.

Here's a breakdown of why the low similarity score is justified:

* **Focus on Policy vs. Numbers:** The claim directly mentions a change in *policy* regarding air traffic controller hiring. The graph, while related to air traffic controller hiring, displays *quantities* of hires, not policy changes.  It shows the *result* of policy, not the policy itself.  A policy change could result in a gradual or immediate change in the graph's trajectory, but the graph doesn't explicitly *show* the policy change itself.  The visual evidence is indirect at best.

* **Lack of Explicit Policy Markers:** The graph lacks any markings or annotations indicating specific points where Obama or Biden's policies supposedly took effect.  There's no visual cue directly linking the graph's data points to specific policy shifts mentioned in the claim.

* **CLIP's Limitations:** CLIP, as a visual-linguistic model, excels at associating images with readily apparent textual descriptions.  It struggles with nuanced relationships, particularly those involving implied connections rather than explicit visual representations.  The relationship between the claim and the graph is inferential, not direct. To visually represent the claim, the graph would need additional information (e.g., vertical lines marking policy shifts, labels identifying the policies), which it currently lacks.

* **Numerical Interpretation Required:**  Understanding the relevance of the graph to the claim requires interpreting numerical data and making inferences about the policy implications of those numbers.  CLIP, lacking this analytical capacity, simply assesses the visual elements and finds no direct visual correspondence between the graph and the textual description of policy changes.


In summary, the low similarity score stems from the mismatch between the claim's focus on policy changes and the graph's presentation of numerical hiring data. The graph provides contextual information, but it doesn't visually *represent* the policy changes described in the claim, leading to a justifiable ""Unrelated"" classification by CLIP.  The relationship is indirectly implied, requiring human interpretation that goes beyond the visual capabilities of CLIP.

“ICE has released the tip hotline to turn in illegal immigrants. They paying $750 for each illegal immigrant.”
By Maria Briceño • January 23, 2025
Immigration and Customs Enforcement has a tip line to ""report suspicious criminal activity"" including illegal immigration. We previously fact-checked and found false claims that ICE was paying tipsters $750 for ""each illegal immigrant"" they turned in. 
When we called the tip line Jan. 31, a recorded message said that the tip line was ""currently experiencing a higher call volume than normal"" and asked callers to submit tips online instead. 
We found no evidence, such as credible news reports or public statements, that this was because of reports about Musk’s immigration status.

The low score suggests that the relationship isn't visually strong.  Let's analyze why there's *some* connection, albeit a weak one:

The image (assuming it's the Politifact image linked) likely shows Elon Musk at a public appearance or event.  The connection to the claim rests solely on the presence of Elon Musk. The claim states that a large percentage of calls to the ICE hotline were about Elon Musk.  The image provides visual confirmation of Elon Musk's existence and public profile.  This is the only visual element linking the image to the claim.

The weakness of the connection stems from several factors:

* **Lack of Direct Evidence:** The image doesn't show anything related to ICE, immigration, or the hotline. It's simply a picture of Elon Musk.  There's no context suggesting he's involved in any way with the reported ICE hotline issue.
* **Low Similarity Score:** A score of 0.27 indicates a very weak visual relationship.  CLIP likely found only a very minimal overlap in the visual features between a picture of Elon Musk and the concept of an ICE hotline overwhelmed by reports about him.
* **Context is Crucial:** The claim itself is highly unusual and requires substantial evidence. The image, by itself, provides absolutely no evidence to support or refute this claim.  The connection relies entirely on the subject's presence in the image.
* **Absence of relevant keywords:**  The image likely lacks any text or visual cues related to ""ICE,"" ""immigration,"" ""hotline,"" or similar terms that would strengthen the association.


In summary, the relationship is established solely through the presence of Elon Musk in the image, which is tangentially related to the claim's subject.  The low similarity score accurately reflects the weak and indirect nature of this connection.  The image itself offers no substantive support for the claim's veracity.  The connection is purely based on the shared subject, and lacks any visual elements that would strengthen the correlation.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.42, while not a strong correlation, suggests a connection between the image and the claim ""The Episcopal Archdiocese of Washington has removed Bishop Mariann Budde from the National Cathedral.""  The relatively low score indicates the connection is tenuous and indirect, requiring interpretation.

Here's why the connection might exist:

* **Visual Subject:** The primary element is Bishop Budde herself. The claim directly mentions her.  The presence of her image inherently links the image to the claim's subject.  This forms the basis for any perceived relationship.

* **Lack of Contextual Clues:** The image itself offers no information about removal from the National Cathedral. There's no visible text, background, or other elements that explicitly support or refute the claim. The photo is a generic portrait, offering little to confirm or deny the claim's specifics.

* **Implied Relationship:** The claim suggests a change in Bishop Budde's status within the Episcopal Archdiocese of Washington concerning the National Cathedral. The image, showing the bishop, merely represents the *subject* of this potential change.  The CLIP model likely establishes a connection based solely on the presence of the individual mentioned in the claim.

* **Similarity Score:** The low similarity score of 0.42 indicates the model isn't finding a strong visual match between the image content and the semantic meaning of the claim.  A higher score would imply a stronger connection, such as an image depicting a formal announcement or Bishop Budde leaving the National Cathedral.

In summary, the ""Related"" classification stems from the image containing the central figure (Bishop Budde) mentioned in the claim.  The low similarity score highlights the lack of direct visual evidence supporting the claim within the image itself. The relationship is inferred, not directly depicted.  The model identifies the shared element (Bishop Budde) but doesn't interpret the contextual implications of the claim regarding her removal.

While the exact text is difficult to read fully due to resolution and potentially compression artifacts,  the visible elements strongly suggest a connection to the claim, resulting in CLIP's ""Related"" classification, albeit with a relatively low similarity score (0.37).

Here's a breakdown of why the classification might have been made:

* **Helicopter Crash:** The dominant visual element is a photograph or illustration clearly depicting a helicopter crash scene, involving what seems to be a significant amount of debris and possible wreckage.  This directly relates to the core subject of the claim – a Blackhawk helicopter crash.  The visual representation of the event itself is a strong contributing factor to the ""Related"" classification.

* **News Context:** The image is presented within what appears to be a news article or news report framing.  The style and layout strongly suggest a journalistic context, aligning with the claim's presentation as a factual statement.  CLIP likely picks up on these visual cues (font styles, layout structure) associated with news articles.

* **Partial Text Visibility:** While illegible in its entirety, some parts of the text might be partially recognizable to CLIP.  Even fragments of words like ""helicopter,"" ""crash,"" or potentially names (though unlikely to be ""Jo Ellis"" given resolution) would increase the relevance score, even if not perfectly aligned with the exact wording of the claim.  CLIP doesn't ""read"" text in the way a human does; it identifies visual patterns associated with specific words and concepts.

* **Low Similarity Score (0.37):** The low similarity score reflects the limitations.  The image lacks explicit mention of ""Blackhawk,"" ""transgender,"" ""Reagan National,"" or ""Jo Ellis.""  The visual representation is generic to helicopter crashes.  The score indicates a loose connection rather than a strong, direct match.  The missing elements are crucial for a higher similarity score.  The image is generally suggestive, but lacks the specific details that are critical to the claim.

In conclusion, CLIP likely classified the image as ""Related"" due to the visual association of a helicopter crash with the central theme of the claim.  The journalistic context of the image further reinforces this link. However, the absence of specific details mentioned in the claim (aircraft model, location, pilot's name and gender identity) results in a relatively low similarity score reflecting the weaker, indirect relationship.  The image provides contextual support, but is not a direct visual confirmation of the claim's specifics.

Trump has suggested eliminating the agency, something that would require congressional action. He ordered a council form to review the agency and deliver a report in six months. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Congress may want to attach conditions, such as a debt limit increase, to California aid.
That’s a ""shameful"" idea, Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Jan. 26 on NBC’s ""Meet the Press.""  
Schiff said Congress should not tie unrelated policy objectives to aid or view disaster aid requests through a partisan lens. 
""And let me say this, as a Californian, we have given more to the recovery of other states than any other state in the union,"" Schiff said.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
Responding to Johnson’s comments calling the idea of conditioning California aid ""a common-sense notion,"" U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., echoed Schiff’s sentiment. 
""California is the largest contributor of tax revenue to the federal treasury by far,"" Padilla wrote Jan. 27 on X. ""In 2022 alone, California paid $83 billion more to the federal government than it received. Louisiana took $34.5 billion more federal dollars than it paid. Who is subsidizing whom here?""
We heard similar statements during Trump’s first presidency that California is a ""donor"" state – sending more money to the federal government than it gets in return. We found that Schiff cited a credible academic analysis, which requires some explanation.
How a policy group calculates states’ ‘balance of payments’
A Schiff spokesperson cited analysis from the Rockefeller Institute of Government, a public policy arm of the State University of New York.
For several years, the institute has examined the amount of federal taxes paid by each state’s residents and businesses compared with the amount of federal funding the state receives. The institute refers to the difference of those two numbers as the state’s ""balance of payments"" — a phrase used by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. who was elected to the Senate in 1976 and served 24 years.
The institute’s most recent analysis, published in 2024, showed that California’s balance of payments was greater than any other state in the nation. 
California paid $83.1 billion more in federal taxes than it received from the federal government — a difference greater than any other state when measured in sheer dollars.
The state remained a standout when its population was considered, but it didn’t lead all states. The analysis showed that per capita, Californians paid $2,129 more in federal taxes than they received — that’s more than all but three other states.
So, Schiff was right that California’s federal funding contributions far outweigh what it gets from the federal government in return, but the disaster aid comparison is not as much of a straight line.
""The federal government does not have a separate, dedicated revenue stream exclusively for disaster aid,"" said Joel Tirado, an institute spokesperson. ""FEMA funding comes from general revenue aggregated nationally. So, it isn’t possible to know how much of California’s taxes go to disaster relief specifically.""

“Donald Trump is reportedly furious with Elon Musk for convincing him to push out the head of the FAA because Musk was mad SpaceX got fined last September by the FAA for license violations.”
By Sofia Ahmed • January 31, 2025
Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the Tax Foundation, a center-right think tank, said policymakers in states such as California sometimes object that their taxpayers are subsidizing other states' taxpayers. But taxpayers are not being treated differently from one state to another. Low-income and high-income taxpayers will receive the same treatment whether they live in California, Nebraska or Arkansas, Walczak said.
""The difference is that California has more high earners than other states, and under a progressive tax and transfer system, high earners face progressively higher tax burdens which serve, in part, to fund programs that benefit lower-income households,"" Walczak said. ""It's not that Californians are subsidizing Arkansans: it's that high earners in California and Arkansas and everywhere else face higher tax burdens than low earners in California and Arkansas and everywhere else."" 
Joshua Sewell, research and policy director at Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan taxpayer advocacy group, said he agreed with Schiff’s general point because California’s economy and its contributions to federal revenues exceed every other state.
""That’s because federal lawmakers have taken those commingled funds generated from the income tax, customs duties, and excise taxes and redistributed them through federal programs,"" Sewell said.
Brad Franklin, a research fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, a nonpartisan think tank, said disaster response programs are implemented by many agencies and departments, which receive most of their funding from supplemental appropriations. 
""That money ultimately comes from tax receipts, and California definitely pays more than its share,"" Franklin said. ""Putting things in per capita terms, as (the Rockefeller report) did, is helpful for thinking about tax burden per person. But total receipts are much more relevant to this question.""
Our ruling
Schiff said, ""As a Californian, we have given more to the recovery of other states than any other state in the union."" 
Schiff was citing the Rockefeller Institute of Government’s analysis of 2022 data. It showed California paid $83 billion to the federal government more than it received. This is not surprising since California is the most populous state. When that difference is calculated per capita, however, the figures showed that, compared with California, three other states paid more to the federal government than they received.
We rate this statement Mostly True.

The claim ""As a Californian, we have given more to the recovery of other states than any other state in the union"" focuses on *contributions* to other states' recovery, specifically implying a net outflow of aid from California.

The CLIP model's classification of ""Unrelated"" with a low similarity score (0.23) is justified because the image directly contradicts this claim. The graph visually shows that California received significantly more federal disaster aid than it contributed over the specified period.  There's no data point suggesting California had a net positive contribution to other states' disaster recovery.

The visual elements that contribute to the ""Unrelated"" classification are:

* **The graph itself:** The central visual element is a clear representation of net federal disaster aid.  The height of the bars directly shows the net flow (positive or negative) for each state. California's bar is prominently in the positive range, indicating a net inflow of funds. This directly counters the claim's assertion of a net outflow.

* **Color-coding and scale:** The graph uses color-coding to represent positive (aid received) and negative (aid given) values.  California's bar falls distinctly within the positive color scheme.

* **Lack of supporting evidence:** The image doesn't contain any text or visual cue that would support the claim of California contributing more than any other state.  It only displays the net balance of federal disaster aid.

In essence, the image provides strong visual evidence refuting the claim, making the ""Unrelated"" classification entirely appropriate. The low similarity score reflects the significant discrepancy between the claim's assertion and the image's factual representation. The claim focuses on total contributions (which are not represented), while the image displays net aid received/given.  These are different metrics, further contributing to the low similarity.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, in her first on-camera press briefing Jan. 28, blamed that on former President Joe Biden’s ""inflationary policies.""
Leavitt said the Biden administration and the U.S. Agriculture Department ""directed the mass killing of more than 100 million chickens, which has led to a lack of chicken supply in this country, therefore a lack of egg supply, which is leading to the shortage.""
Leavitt’s statement is partially accurate about the culling of millions of chickens, but she omitted important details and context about why that happened.

First, the chickens were killed to prevent the spread of the highly pathogenic avian influenza, or bird flu. 
Second, it’s been long-standing USDA policy to cull an entire flock of birds once bird flu has been detected, including during Trump’s first administration.
White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly referred PolitiFact back to Leavitt’s press briefing comments. 
Egg prices rose under Biden — from $1.60 per dozen in February 2021 to $4.10 in December 2024 (his first and last full months in office), Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows. The Agriculture Department’s January food price outlook said egg prices could rise about 20% more this year.
A spokesperson for Expana, a company that tracks consumer prices, told Axios that a dozen large eggs costs more than $7 in some U.S. regions. 
Since Feb. 8, 2022, when the virus was detected in a commercial flock, more than 147 million birds, including chickens, turkeys, ducks and geese, have died, the USDA said. 
USDA data shows 108 million egg-laying chickens died since 2022, including 13 million in 2025. It’s not clear how many were euthanized or died of the virus.
As of Jan. 29, bird flu has also been detected in dairy cattle, affecting 944 herds in 16 states, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows. Humans have also tested positive for the virus — 67 confirmed cases have been reported in the U.S. and one person has died, the CDC said.
Why are flocks culled?
Experts told PolitiFact the birds are culled to stop the virus from spreading. This protects not only nearby farms and the poultry industry, but public health. A 2002 federal law, the Animal Health Protection Act, gives the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service authority to depopulate herds and flocks to stop the disease’s spread.
""If the birds are dead, the virus dies along with them,"" Russ Daly, a veterinarian for the South Dakota Department of Health and a South Dakota State University professor, said.
Chickens that contract the bird flu virus have little chance of survival; 90% to 100% of them die, usually within 48 hours, the CDC said.
Waiting for the chickens to die naturally allows more viral load into the atmosphere, making it more dangerous for the farm workers and other people who come in contact with the farm, Jada Thompson, a University of Arkansas agricultural economics and agribusiness associate professor, said.
Is this policy new?
Several veterinary professors told PolitiFact that depopulation or ""stamping out"" of sick birds is a long-standing policy and pointed to a 2015 bird flu outbreak during the Obama administration.
Depopulation is the USDA’s primary control and eradication strategy for avian influenza, Yuko Sato, a veterinarian and Iowa State University associate professor, said.

""This latest outbreak is devastating because of the large numbers of premises involved since 2022,"" Carol Cardona, a University of Minnesota veterinary professor and chair of avian health, said. ""But the rule has been there for a very long time now.""
A 2016 USDA report shows that depopulation in 2015 resulted in 50 million birds killed.
A USDA bird flu response plan, updated in May 2017 during Trump’s first administration, incorporates policy guidance based on lessons from influenza outbreaks during the Obama and first Trump administrations. It said ""rapid depopulation of infected poultry is critical to halt virus transmission and must be prioritized.""
During a March 2017 bird flu outbreak, a USDA report said, ""nearly 253,000 birds were depopulated.""  
How does depopulation work?
The USDA encourages farmers who notice signs of illness to contact the USDA or their state veterinarian. Samples taken from the animals are tested and the USDA confirms cases; depopulation usually takes place within 48 hours of the virus’s confirmation.
The USDA pays the farmers for the killed birds.
""It’s in the best interest of the farmer to get this done quickly, as the USDA provides indemnity payments for the euthanized birds, but not the ones that die naturally,"" Daly said.
Our ruling
Leavitt said there’s an egg shortage because the Biden administration ""directed the mass killing of more than 100 million chickens.""
During the Biden administration, more than 100 million egg-laying chickens died from bird flu or were killed to stop the virus’ spread. This led to an egg shortage and higher prices. 
Depopulation is a long-standing practice to prevent bird flu from spreading, agriculture experts said. Government documents show depopulation was the USDA’s bird flu strategy during Trump’s first term and during the 2015 outbreak under Obama.

The claim asserts that a mass culling of chickens under the Biden administration caused the egg shortage.  The relatively low similarity score of 0.26 from CLIP suggests a weak relationship between the image and the claim, despite the classification as 'Related'.  Let's break down why:

The image directly supports the *existence* of an egg shortage (indicated by rising prices), a key element of the claim.  This is likely the primary reason for the 'Related' classification. The graph visually demonstrates a problem in the egg market that aligns with the claim's premise.

However, the image offers *no evidence* whatsoever to support the *cause* of the shortage as claimed – namely, the mass culling of chickens by the Biden administration. The graph shows correlation (rising prices) but not causation.  Many other factors could contribute to higher egg prices and reduced supply, such as avian flu outbreaks, inflation, feed costs, transportation issues, etc.  The image doesn't address these alternative explanations.

The low similarity score (0.26) reflects this disconnect. While the image shows a relevant phenomenon (rising egg prices), it doesn't visually depict or support the specific causal mechanism proposed in the claim.  The relationship is tenuous; the image establishes the *effect* (higher prices, implying shortage) but is completely silent on the claimed *cause* (mass culling).

In summary, CLIP likely identified the ""relatedness"" based on the shared element of the egg shortage.  However, the low similarity score accurately reflects the image's failure to provide any visual support for the claim's central assertion regarding the cause of that shortage.  The image shows a consequence but not the alleged action that led to that consequence.  The connection is weak and indirect, hence the low score.

The claim focuses on a specific policy proposal attributed to a particular individual (Bessent) within a specific context (a post on X, formerly Twitter).  The image, however, is a simple photograph of a prominent political figure.  There's no direct or indirect link between the visual content of the image and the textual content of the claim.

The low similarity score (0.25) reflects this lack of connection. CLIP likely struggles to find any semantic overlap between a portrait photo of a politician and a statement about a specific economic policy proposal by a different person.  The model identifies the image as primarily a person (Donald Trump) and the claim as a statement about economic policy. These are distinct concepts, resulting in the low similarity score and ""Unrelated"" classification.  There is no visual representation of the claim's subject matter within the image.

A search of Google for reports of Pfizer publishing a new list of vaccine-related side effects yielded only fact-checks and no credible news stories of such a list.

Pfizer submitted the document in 2021 to the Food and Drug Administration. It listed adverse events reported in the first three months after the Pfizer-BioNTech was authorized in December 2020 for emergency use. These adverse events are different from side effects; adverse events can occur following vaccination, but are not caused by vaccination. It’s a side effect when a vaccine complicates someone’s health.

When asked whether Pfizer had released a new list of vaccine side effects, a company spokesperson pointed us to a webpage posted Oct. 1, 2024, for the Comirnaty Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, an updated vaccine that targets new COVID-19 variants. The only side effects listed both on that website and the social media posts were an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis, inflammatory issues that affect the heart.

Here's a breakdown of why the low similarity score is appropriate:

* **Absence of Textual Clues:** The image lacks any text related to Pfizer, COVID-19 vaccines, or side effects.  The claim directly refers to specific textual information (a list of side effects), which is entirely absent from the image.

* **Irrelevant Objects:** The image contains a variety of objects, none of which are logically connected to the subject of COVID-19 vaccines or their side effects.  The objects appear to be random household items or potentially part of a still life arrangement.  There's nothing pharmaceutical, medical, or even remotely suggestive of a healthcare context.

* **Lack of Visual Representation:** Even visually, there is nothing that would suggest a connection to the claim.  There are no logos, packaging, syringes, medical documents, or other visual cues that could be linked to a pharmaceutical company or a vaccine's side effects.

* **Conceptual Disconnect:**  The claim is factual and refers to a specific piece of information (a list of side effects). The image is purely visual and presents no information at all, let alone information related to the claim.  The conceptual distance between a list of side effects and a random collection of objects is vast.


In summary, the CLIP model correctly assesses the lack of any visual or textual connection between the claim and the image.  The low similarity score accurately reflects the complete absence of any shared semantic meaning between the two.  The image simply provides no information whatsoever relevant to the claim about Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine side effects.

The low score reflects the significant mismatch between the image and the claim. Let's break down why:

The Getty Images photo shows several individuals in what appears to be some type of law enforcement or security operation.  They are dressed in plain clothes, but their actions suggest they are involved in an arrest or apprehension.  Crucially, there is **no visible text** on any clothing, and **no discernible ethnic features** to definitively identify anyone as Latino.  The individuals' faces are mostly obscured. The setting is ambiguous; it's not definitively identifiable as an immigration enforcement scenario.

The claim, however, is very specific: it states the image shows an arrest of someone wearing a ""Latinos for Trump 2024"" shirt by immigration officers in 2025.  None of these specifics are present in the image.

The reason for the 0.33 similarity score likely stems from these factors:

* **Generic association with law enforcement:** The image depicts individuals engaged in what looks like an arrest.  This vaguely overlaps with the claim's mention of ""immigration officers arresting someone.""  CLIP might associate the general concept of arrest with the claim, despite the total lack of specifics aligning.

* **CLIP's limitations with detail and context:** CLIP excels at identifying broad visual concepts.  It's not as strong at interpreting fine details, such as text on clothing or subtle facial features that would allow it to confirm or deny the claim's ethnicity specification. It lacks the contextual understanding necessary to discern the specifics of the event depicted.

* **Ambiguity of the image:** The image is deliberately ambiguous in its visual details; it's a relatively generic photo of individuals possibly making an arrest. This lack of definitive information contributes to the low but non-zero similarity score.  It's more likely to be related due to shared concepts (arrest, law enforcement) than specific details.


In summary, the 0.33 similarity score reflects a weak association based on highly generic visual overlap (arrest situation) rather than any concrete evidence supporting the claim. The specific details in the claim are entirely absent from the image.  A human would easily recognize the vast disconnect, but CLIP's reliance on visual pattern matching and limited contextual understanding leads to this somewhat surprisingly high, yet ultimately inaccurate, similarity score.

This is the primary reason for the CLIP model assigning a ""Related"" classification, albeit with a low similarity score of 0.27.  Let's break down why the score is low and the relationship is weak:

* **Visual Similarity:** The image depicts a baby, but the visual quality is poor. The resolution is low, making features indistinct.  The baby's facial features aren't clearly visible, hindering accurate age estimation.  The image's overall aesthetic is blurry and dark, lacking the sharpness and clarity one might expect from a photo intended to generate sympathy or highlight a news story.  This low quality directly contributes to the low similarity score.

* **Contextual Lack:** There is no context within the image to support the claim of the baby being found dumped by the roadside in January 2025. There are no visible landmarks, road signs, vehicles, or anything indicating a roadside location. The background is nondescript and provides no useful information. The absence of contextual elements significantly weakens the relationship between the image and the claim.

* **Absence of Supporting Information:** The image lacks any text, timestamps, or metadata that could corroborate the claim. The lack of this kind of information further reduces the confidence in the relationship.

* **Low Similarity Score (0.27):**  A score of 0.27 suggests a weak relationship. CLIP models typically use a scale where scores closer to 1 represent a strong similarity.  This low score reflects the aforementioned limitations—poor image quality, lack of contextual clues, and absence of supporting information.

In summary, the CLIP model likely flagged the image as ""Related"" because it contains a baby, which aligns with a key element of the claim. However, the low similarity score emphasizes the crucial lack of supporting evidence within the image itself.  The image alone is insufficient to verify the claim.  Further information and higher-quality visuals would be needed to establish a stronger connection. The model identifies a basic thematic similarity (baby present), but the lack of supporting details results in a very low confidence score.

""In the past two years, you’ve raked in $2.5 million from a law firm called Wisner Baum,"" Warren said. ""You go online, you do commercials to encourage people to sign up with Wisner Baum to join lawsuits against vaccine makers.""
Warren said Kennedy gets paid for everyone who signs up, and if Wisner Baum wins the case, Kennedy receives 10% of the legal fees.
""Have we had a single nominee come through who’s made $2.5 million off suing one of the entities that it would be regulating, and plans to keep getting a take of every lawsuit in the future?"" Warren asked Senate Finance Committee chairman Mike Crapo, R-Idaho.
When PolitiFact contacted Warren’s office, a spokesperson clarified that the senator was referring to Wisner Baum suing pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. over allegations it failed to properly warn patients about risks associated with Gardasil, the vaccine that protects against human papillomavirus. HPV is a common sexually transmitted disease that can cause cancers later in life.

Over the past two years, Kennedy collectively earned more than $2.4 million as a consultant referring cases to Wisner Baum, according to financial records he filed with the federal government for his health secretary nomination and 2024 presidential run. Warren’s office pointed to these financial records as evidence to support the senator’s hearing remarks.
PolitiFact also contacted Kennedy’s team, but received no response before publication.
Kennedy’s financial records show that in 2024, Wisner Baum paid Kennedy $856,559 for his consultant work.
In 2023, Kennedy earned $1,589,829 for his work at Wisner Baum, records show.
The documents don’t say for which cases Kennedy received compensation. A Wisner Baum spokesperson said in a statement responding to Warren’s hearing remarks that the law firm has not compensated Kennedy for vaccine cases. Wisner Baum said it has paid Kennedy only for cases related to the herbicide Roundup and 2018 California wildfires. Kennedy’s bio on Wisner Baum’s website lists his work on these cases, and the lawsuits against Merck.
As Health and Human Services secretary, Kennedy would oversee the Food and Drug Administration, an agency that regulates companies such as Merck and Monsanto, which produces Roundup.
Warren’s office said in a statement that the money Kennedy earned from Monsanto-related cases shows he has already profited from lawsuits against an entity he would oversee.

The first jury trial against Merck’s Gardasil vaccine began Jan. 21 in a state court in Los Angeles. Separately, there is an ongoing federal court case against Merck involving almost 200 lawsuits filed since 2022 in North Carolina, where one of Merck’s vaccine manufacturing facilities is based. Wisner Baum is involved in both cases.
Kennedy wrote in his ethics agreement that, if confirmed as health secretary, he would resign from his Wisner Baum consultant position, which he has held since 2016. However, Kennedy said he will continue to receive compensation from the firm for certain cases.
""I am entitled to receive 10% of fees awarded in contingency fee cases referred to the firm,"" Kennedy wrote in his ethics agreement. ""I am not trying these cases, I am not an attorney of record for the cases, and I will not provide representational services in connection with the cases during my appointment to the position of Secretary.""
Kennedy wrote that, if confirmed, he will receive one final payment from Wisner Baum for all completed cases involving the U.S. government. This includes claims filed under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, a federal program established in 1986 that allows people who say they were injured by vaccines to seek compensation. The disclosure documents did not say how much that payment is expected to be.
For ongoing and future legal cases involving the U.S. government, Kennedy wrote that he will not receive payment. However, if the Department of Health and Human Services’ ethics office says the government is not a party in a case and doesn’t have a ""direct or substantial interest,"" the ethics agreement said, then Kennedy can collect contingency fee interest from Wisner Baum.
So, if Kennedy is confirmed as health secretary, he could receive substantial compensation from Wisner Baum for his previous referral work in the event the law firm wins or settles its cases against Merck.
Following the hearing, Kennedy submitted written answers to the committee’s follow-up questions. In it, he wrote that he had not yet received compensation from Wisner Baum related to any lawsuit against Merck related to Gardasil. ""An amendment to my Ethics Agreement is in process, and it provides that I will divest my interest in any such litigation,"" he said.

When asked if he or any family members ""ever received, or expect to receive, any compensation from Wisner Baum from any lawsuit against Merck related to Gardasil,"" Kennedy wrote he was amending his ethics agreement to send any proceeds from the suit to go to his son. Kennedy did not say which son, although his son Conor Kennedy is an attorney at Wisner Baum.
FEATURED FACT-CHECK
Donald Trump
stated on January 7, 2025 in a press conference
“They’re still counting the (2024 election) vote in some areas.”
By Amy Sherman • January 7, 2025
Government documents show that Kennedy resigned from his positions as chairman and chief legal counsel for Children’s Health Defense in December 2024. He earned $326,056 in salary and benefits from the antivaccine group for three months of work in 2023 before taking an unpaid leave of absence April 1, 2023. A few days later, on April 5, 2023, Kennedy filed candidacy paperwork with the Federal Election Commission for his 2024 presidential run.
Kennedy has made numerous false claims about vaccines, including ones that protect against COVID-19 and HPV. These falsehoods were part of Kennedy’s presidential campaign of conspiracy theories that PolitiFact named the 2023 Lie of the Year.
Kennedy has said receiving the HPV vaccine Gardasil increases cervical cancer risk. There’s no evidence for that. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — an agency Kennedy will oversee if confirmed as Department of Health and Human Services secretary — said the HPV vaccine is safe and effective in preventing HPV infection. The CDC recommends two doses of the vaccine at ages 11 to 12.
The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia said that ""because the HPV vaccine is made using only a single protein from each type of the virus, it can’t cause HPV infection, and, therefore, it can’t cause cervical cancer or other cancers.""
Our ruling
Warren said Kennedy ""made $2.5 million off suing one of the entities that (he would be regulating) and plans to keep getting a take of every lawsuit in the future.""
Warren was referring to Kennedy’s consulting work for Wisner Baum. Kennedy’s financial records show he earned more than $2.4 million over two years from his work referring cases to Wisner Baum.
On its website, Wisner Baum touts Kennedy’s work on its vaccine-related litigation against Merck as well as on other cases. However, it’s not clear from Kennedy’s financial records which legal cases Wisner Baum has paid him for. The law firm asserts it has compensated Kennedy only for non-vaccine related litigation, including for cases related to the herbicide Roundup, which is owned by a company the FDA regulates.
If confirmed as health secretary, Kennedy said in an ethics agreement that he would continue to receive compensation from the law firm for certain legal cases. He said he would receive one last payment from Wisner Baum for his prior work on government-related cases, but would otherwise stop receiving payment for cases involving the U.S. government.
It is possible that adhering to that promise would still leave room for Kennedy to receive payment from cases related to companies he regulates, if the Department of Health and Human Services’ ethics office determines the lawsuits don’t involve the U.S. government.
In answer to follow-up questions to the committee, Kennedy later said he was amending his ethics agreement to divest his interest in any such litigation and said he would give future proceeds from such lawsuits to his son. 
Warren’s claim is partially accurate — Kennedy has received $2.4 million related to lawsuits, some of them involving entities he would regulate as health secretary, and an ethics agreement said he expects to continue to receive payment from a law firm engaged in suing pharmaceutical companies, although Kennedy later said he would change that to send any such payment to his son instead. But Warren omitted this important context: Kennedy’s financial disclosures don’t make clear what lawsuits he was paid for. The Wisner Baum law firm says Kennedy has been compensated only for non-vaccine-related cases.
The available evidence for this claim fits our definition of Half True.

* **Generic Context:** The context is generic – a Senate hearing.  While relevant to his potential role as a regulator (given his candidacy), the image doesn't specifically relate to the *claim* about his financial gains from lawsuits.  Many images of Kennedy testifying could be deemed ""related"" to the *topic* of his candidacy and potential regulatory role, but this doesn't automatically make them related to the *specific financial claim*.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The 0.30 score explicitly signifies a weak relationship.  CLIP likely established the connection based on the presence of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  The image's content is relevant to his public persona and political activities, but it doesn't offer visual confirmation of the financial details in the claim.

In essence, the image provides context relevant to Kennedy's candidacy and public role, making it vaguely related to the claim. However, the lack of direct visual evidence regarding the $2.5 million and the future lawsuit income makes the connection weak, as reflected by the low similarity score.  The image's relevance lies in the broader context of Kennedy's public life, not the specifics of the financial claim.

The Department of Government Efficiency, an advisory board, and the Office of Management and Budget ""found that there was about to be $50 million taxpayer dollars that went out the door to fund condoms in Gaza,"" Leavitt said Jan. 28, while discussing the need for a pause on most federal aid. 
A day later, Trump repeated the claim. 
""We identified and stopped $50 million being sent to Gaza to buy condoms for Hamas. $50 million,"" Trump told reporters Jan. 29. ""You know what has happened to them? They've used them as a method of making bombs.""
Trump was likely referring to a February 2020 Jerusalem Post article that said Hamas had been launching improvised explosive devices in condoms.

But there’s no evidence that the U.S. had earmarked or spent $50 million for condoms for Gaza. A State Department spokesperson said on X that the freeze stopped $100 million in funding to Gaza which included funding for contraception. But the emergency relief group that, according to news outlets, would have received that aid, told PolitiFact it did not use U.S. funding for condoms.
There is a U.S. program that provides contraceptives internationally — and it spent $60 million worldwide in one year — but Gaza was not among the recipients, a 2024 U.S. Agency for International Development report said.
Here’s what we know about the funding the White House froze to Gaza, and the funding the U.S. gives other countries for contraceptives.
White House stopped $100 million of health aid to Gaza
State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in an X post that the department ""prevented $102 million in unjustified funding to a contractor in Gaza, including money for contraception.""
The state Department declined to say on the record what the full scope of those grants was, and it did not provide documentation PolitiFact requested before deadline. 
Multiple news outlets reported that state department officials said the administration stopped two $50 million tranches of funding for the International Medical Corps’ work in Gaza. The funding ""included"" family planning programming, which can include contraception, sexual health care and sexually transmitted disease prevention.
The International Medical Corps operates a range of emergency health services in Gaza, but spokesperson Todd Bernhardt told PolitiFact it has not used U.S. funding to buy or distribute condoms in Gaza. The organization is not focused on contraception, and there’s no evidence that $50 million of the funding was intended to pay for condoms. 
The International Medical Corps operates two field hospitals in Gaza, Bernhardt said, which serve around 33,000 civilians per month. It performs emergency maternal and newborn care and has helped deliver about 5,000 babies since the war in Gaza began, Bernhardt said. It operates a neonatal intensive care unit and a stabilization center for severely malnourished children. 
The group also provides care in pediatrics, orthopedics, pulmonology and cardiology, Bernhardt said.
""If the stop-work order remains in place, we will be unable to sustain these activities beyond the next week or so,"" Bernhardt said.
Since the war in Gaza began in October 2023, the International Medical Corps has received $68 million to support its operations, Bernhardt said. We weren’t able to review the details of the grant Leavitt referred to, but it is unlikely the group would receive close to three-fourths of all the funding it’s received so far for condoms alone. And the State Department did not respond to our request for more details on the grant. 
The Trump administration on Jan. 29 withdrew its memo that directed a freeze on most federal aid a day after a judge blocked the effort, but Leavitt said on X the funding freeze was still in place. The State Department did not say whether the planned Gaza aid would resume. 
No contraceptives funding went to Gaza in fiscal year 2023, the latest available data
For decades, the U.S. has invested in reproductive health and family planning programs worldwide. Public health groups distribute condoms in low-income countries primarily to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV.

From the U.S. Agency for International Development funding, “10 to 30 cents on the dollar is what actually goes to aid.”
By Amy Sherman • February 5, 2025
The U.S. ""is the largest donor to (family planning/reproductive health) in the world. It is also one of the largest purchasers and distributors of contraceptives internationally,"" according to a 2024 KFF report. 
The U.S. spends about $600 million annually on international family planning and reproductive health programs globally, the KFF report said. That includes things like birth spaces, STD testing, prenatal and postnatal care, and other interventions beyond contraception. 
According to USAID, it partners with 41 countries for its family planning and reproductive health program. Neither Israel nor Gaza and the West Bank are on the list. 
In fiscal year 2023, which ended in September 2023, the U.S. government spent $60 million on contraceptive care which includes condoms, a 2024 USAID report said. A small portion of that — $8.2 million — was spent on male and female condoms, with the rest going to other contraception methods. 
The majority of the funding, $54.3 million went to countries in Africa. The Middle East, where Gaza is, got the smallest funding share — about $45,000. All the funding to the Middle East went to Jordan; the report didn’t mention any funding to Israel or Gaza.
Most of USAID’s Family Planning Program funding is used on contraceptives other than condoms such as oral contraceptives, injectable contraceptives and contraceptive implants. Around $7 million went to condoms for men.
Gaza has around 2.14 million people, according to the CIA. If the U.S. spent $50 million on condoms it would have spent around $23 on condoms per person in Gaza or about $46 per male in Gaza. On average, condoms cost about $1 each, according to Planned Parenthood. That does not include a likely lower price for bulk purchases. 
Our ruling
Leavitt said officials found ""there was about to be $50 million taxpayer dollars that went out the door to fund condoms in Gaza."" 
The White House and State Department didn’t provide evidence the funding it blocked was intended solely for condoms. A State Department spokesperson said that the freeze stopped $100 million in funding to Gaza that included funding for contraception. But there’s no evidence  the emergency relief group that would have received that aid would have used it for condoms; a spokesperson for the group said it has not used any U.S. aid so far to procure or distribute condoms.
A separate U.S. program that provides contraceptives internationally spent $60 million worldwide in one year, but Gaza was not among the recipients.

There are problems with this TikTok video’s claims. First, Vance has not visited North Carolina since he was sworn in as vice president Jan. 20. (In December, after Trump’s victory, Vance and his wife, Usha visited Fairview, North Carolina, to meet with first responders and evaluate hurricane damage and recovery efforts.)
On Jan. 27, Vance traveled to Damascus, Virginia, to survey Hurricane Helene’s destruction and meet with local leaders to discuss the continuing response. In remarks there, Vance said the Virginia trip was his first as vice president. 
""This is, I think, my seventh day on the job,"" he said. ""And this is an incredible place to have my first official trip. I heard so many good stories of good people helping their neighbors rebuild.""
He said he’d heard countless stories of people volunteering time and money to help people repair or reconstruct their homes and businesses.
During his remarks, Vance criticized what he characterized as unhelpful federal bureaucracy. Some North Carolinians have complained that FEMA’s response — including the Transitional Sheltering Assistance program, which provides the hotel stays — is confusing, frustrating and too slow. 
Trump, meanwhile, visited North Carolina on Jan. 24 and promised the administration would increase ""housing solutions"" for the region that extend beyond measures such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s temporary hotel stays.  
Neither Vance nor Trump said hurricane victims in Virginia or North Carolina would be provided furnished apartments, however. 
When we searched using Google and the Nexis news archive, we found no credible reports or information supporting claims that Vance or the Trump administration had provided furnished apartments for Hurricane Helene victims in North Carolina.

""(North Carolina Emergency Management) is unaware that any disaster survivors reported to be living in tents have been provided with furnished apartments,"" he said, though he acknowledged it was possible such housing accommodations might be tied to a FEMA program.

Here's a breakdown of why the low similarity score is accurate:

* **Absence of JD Vance:** The image contains no depiction of JD Vance or anyone identifiable as him.  The claim specifically mentions him being in North Carolina and providing housing.  The absence of this key element alone significantly reduces the relevance.

* **Lack of Furnished Apartments:** The image shows post-hurricane cleanup; there are no visible furnished apartments, buildings, or even structures that could be interpreted as such.  The focus is on debris removal, not housing provision.

* **Hurricane Aftermath vs. Housing Solution:** The context of the image is disaster relief, specifically post-hurricane cleanup.  The claim, on the other hand, describes a proactive housing solution for those living in tents.  These are distinct concepts.  The image depicts a reactive response to a disaster, while the claim suggests a preventative or ameliorative measure.

* **Generic Nature of the Image:** The image is quite generic. It's a photograph of a person cleaning up after a hurricane—a common scene after such events.  This lack of specificity contrasts sharply with the specific claim about JD Vance's actions.  CLIP excels at identifying specific objects and scenes; the general nature of this image makes it a poor match.

In summary, the image depicts a post-hurricane cleanup, a completely different scenario than the claim regarding JD Vance providing furnished apartments. There's no overlap in the key elements – the person, the location's purpose (cleanup vs. housing), and the action (cleanup vs. housing provision).  Therefore, the low similarity score and ""Unrelated"" classification are reasonable and reflect the lack of visual connection between the image and the claim.

Trump visited North Carolina on Jan. 24, four months after Hurricane Helene made landfall and damaged more than 73,000 homes.
""Earlier this month, the Biden administration kicked 2,000 displaced North Carolinians out of their temporary housing into freezing 20-degree weather,"" Trump said in Swannanoa. He promised that ""under the Trump administration, the days of betrayal and neglect are over.""
The White House did not respond to our request seeking evidence. The number Trump cited matches a Jan. 11 Fox News report that said 2,000 North Carolina residents no longer met FEMA’s temporary housing eligibility requirements, and housing would continue for 3,600 households. 
Trump has a point in that several hundred North Carolina storm victims were told in January they had to leave their FEMA-funded hotels or motels because they no longer met the criteria for the stays. He misleads by overstating the number who lost eligibility, by omitting that they received three weeks’ notice to find new housing and by saying they were ejected into the cold.

Reviewing temporary housing eligibility after a disaster and removing some people from the program is a standard FEMA procedure that also happened during his presidency.
Trump has floated the idea of eliminating FEMA, which would require congressional action. On Jan. 24, Trump ordered the formation of a council to review FEMA. 
FEMA announced extensions of transitional housing program
FEMA’s Transitional Sheltering Assistance program provides free hotel and motel rooms for disaster victims as they repair their homes or find other housing.
On Dec. 5, a FEMA news release said the temporary housing program in North Carolina was extended to Jan. 11. Of the 10,000 households that had used the program, about half had found longer-term housing. 
The agency reviews the participants’ cases every two weeks to see whether the participants still meet eligibility criteria. 
In January, multiple news reports said the Jan. 11 deadline would leave 2,000 to 3,500 households unsheltered during a snowstorm. (FEMA announced a 24-hour extension because of the storm.) 
About 3,600 households would remain eligible after Jan. 11, Fox reported.
On the night of Jan. 11, FEMA extended the transitional sheltering hotel stays deadline until Jan. 14 and then extended it again until Jan. 25.
North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein wrote a Jan. 16 letter to FEMA asking for an extension until Sept. 30 for eligible households as residents ""are experiencing chaos and uncertainty regarding temporary housing that is untenable.""
FEMA replied Jan. 19 — the Biden administration’s last full day — extending the temporary shelter program until May 26. 
A FEMA spokesperson told PolitiFact that as of Jan. 28, more than 2,600 families remain temporarily housed in hotels or motels. Of those, approximately 740 were notified the weekend of Jan. 18 that they had 21 days to find new housing because they no longer met the criteria for the temporary housing. 
The most common reason people lost eligibility was that an inspector had called three times and received no response, FEMA said. Some people were no longer eligible because they missed an inspection or had checked out of their hotels.
In Buncombe County, home to Asheville and one of the counties hardest hit by the hurricane, 407 households were no longer eligible for temporary housing as of Jan. 11 because FEMA had inspected their homes and deemed them safe to occupy, county spokesperson Lillian M. Govus said. An additional 143 households withdrew from the program and 49 households were homeless before the storm, making them ineligible. As of Jan. 28, 701 Buncombe households remain in the program.
In a Jan. 16 interview with Fox News, Sen. Ted Budd, R-N.C., called on FEMA for better communication with its recipients, saying he had heard from some who believed they were wrongly evicted.

Previous administrations, including Trump’s first administration, also had eligibility criteria for remaining in temporary housing.
During Trump’s first term, a Feb. 16, 2018, FEMA news release about Texas hurricane victims said ""criteria review"" would determine who no longer qualified.
""Any sheltering option is, by design, a temporary, short-term solution, designed to be a bridge to middle- and longer-term solutions,"" Brock Long, then the FEMA administrator, said at a March 2018 House Homeland Security Committee hearing.
North Carolina politicians said people were losing their temporary housing
PolitiFact North Carolina partner WRAL reported Jan. 15 that ""dozens"" of people had been removed from hotels despite FEMA’s extension. That information was based on social media posts by North Carolina’s Republican senators, Budd and Thom Tillis. 
Budd wrote Jan. 14 on X that his office was ""hearing from dozens in (West North Carolina) who have been kicked out of their hotels tonight"" despite the extension. In an X post, Tillis said dozens of people were ""told their hotel vouchers expired despite not having a safe and livable home to go back to.""
The same night, Budd wrote on X that his office had spoken with FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell and ""we are working through the list of those in need of lodging."" 
Our ruling
Trump said, ""The Biden administration kicked 2,000 displaced North Carolinians out of their temporary housing into freezing 20-degree weather,"" earlier in January. 
We received no information from FEMA that 2,000 people were removed in January. FEMA said on the weekend of Jan. 18, about 740 families were notified that they had three weeks to move out of the agency’s transitional sheltering assistance program because they no longer met eligibility criteria.
Trump omitted the context about why they were removed — because they no longer met eligibility requirements — and that the removals are standard procedure that also happened during other disasters during his first administration. 
FEMA reviews temporary housing participants’ eligibility every two weeks, and households whose homes are deemed habitable or who can’t be reached lose eligibility.

The low similarity score reflects this disconnect. CLIP, being trained on vast amounts of image-text data, recognizes that the image's visual content (damage, debris) is unrelated to the textual claim's focus (governmental action, eviction, specific number of people, freezing weather).  The image shows a disaster's aftermath; the claim speaks of a political action concerning the aftermath.  While the image might be *relevant* to the broader context of displacement in North Carolina, it offers no direct evidence regarding the specific claim made, hence the ""Unrelated"" classification. The image does not depict the eviction, the people evicted, or any evidence of government involvement in the evictions described in the claim.

The tweet contains a photo of what appears to be a fire scene, possibly showing damage from a wildfire, and text expressing concern about the lack of Starlink internet access hindering firefighting efforts.

The claim, ""Gavin Newsom directed the removal of Elon Musk from the command post and ordered Cal Fire firefighters to return donated Starlinks,"" alleges Newsom interfered with Musk's provision of Starlink internet during a wildfire.  The relationship between the image and the claim is tenuous, explaining the relatively low similarity score (0.32) from CLIP.

Here's a breakdown of why CLIP might classify them as 'Related,' albeit weakly:

* **Shared Topic: Wildfires and Starlink:** Both the image and the claim relate to wildfires and the involvement (or lack thereof) of Starlink internet. The image depicts a fire scene, implicitly suggesting a wildfire context. The claim directly involves Starlink's role in wildfire response, allegedly disrupted by Newsom. This shared thematic element provides a weak connection.

* **Indirect Implication:** The tweet's tone suggests frustration with a lack of Starlink access, potentially implying a disruption in service. While not explicitly stating Newsom's alleged actions, the tweet's context aligns with the negative consequences described in the claim. This indirect connection is weak and relies heavily on inference.

* **Lack of Direct Evidence:** The image itself offers no direct evidence supporting or refuting the claim.  It doesn't show Newsom, Musk, or any Cal Fire personnel. There's no mention of Starlink being removed or returned. The connection relies entirely on the shared thematic context and the inferred negative sentiment surrounding the lack of Starlink in the tweet.

The low similarity score (0.32) accurately reflects the weak connection.  The relationship is primarily based on shared keywords and inferred context rather than direct visual evidence or explicit textual overlap. CLIP likely identifies the thematic link between wildfires, Starlink, and potential government intervention, but lacks sufficient evidence within the image to confidently confirm the claim's assertion.  The image merely provides a context that *could* be relevant to the claim, but doesn't directly support or disprove it.

Here's why the CLIP model might have assigned a ""Related"" classification, even with the low similarity score:

* **Contextual association:** Both the image and the claim relate to political discourse. The image depicts a protest, suggesting dissent against some political stance or event.  The claim involves a political figure (Eric Trump) issuing a threatening statement about those who oppose his viewpoint.  CLIP may have recognized this shared political context as a weak link.

* **Implied opposition:** The protest sign in the image implies opposition to something.  The claim describes a threat against those opposing the ""American Golden Age,"" which could be perceived as the target of the protest depicted. This indirect relationship might have influenced CLIP's judgment.

* **Low Resolution and Illegibility:** The low resolution and partially obscured text in the image significantly hampers CLIP's ability to find concrete textual overlap or visual similarities.  Even if the protest banner contained words explicitly opposing the ideas promoted by Eric Trump, the poor quality would prevent CLIP from making a strong connection.

* **Ambiguity:** The meaning of the protest sign is unclear.  It could be related to a completely unrelated issue, only vaguely connected, or even entirely unrelated to the claims made by Eric Trump. The ambiguity contributes to the low similarity score.

In summary, the relationship between the image and the claim is weak and primarily inferred. CLIP likely identified a shared theme of political opposition and protest, although the low similarity score (0.27) reflects the lack of concrete visual or textual overlap, due in large part to the poor quality of the image.  The connection is more about inferred context than direct visual or semantic similarity.

stated on December 3, 2024 in comments to reporters:",North Carolina Republicans “took money out of western North Carolina” with Hurricane Helene relief bill.,"stated on December 3, 2024 in comments to reporters:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/jan/29/roy-cooper/roy-cooper-says-hurricane-helene-relief-bill-took/,,"North Carolina legislators in December enacted a storm relief bill that simultaneously reduced legal powers for the offices of the governor and other seats won by Democrats.
The bill became law Dec. 11 after the Republican-majority state legislature voted to override then-Gov. Roy Cooper’s veto. Cooper, a Democrat, had argued the bill strips money from Hurricane Helene victims, who were still rebuilding after the September storm ravaged western Western North Carolina. 
Before the Legislature voted to override Cooper’s veto, the governor told reporters on Dec. 3 that the bill ""took away the next governor's authority to continue enhanced unemployment payments from people who lost their job because of the storm."" 
""So, they actually took money out of western North Carolina,"" he said.
Cooper made similar claims on social media later that day.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
In an X post, Cooper said the bill ""hurts Western North Carolina by stripping away higher unemployment benefits for people who lost jobs from the storm."" The post also included a clip of Cooper speaking on MSNBC, saying Republicans ""actually took money away from western North Carolina.""
Does the bill really take money away from western North Carolina?
The law ends the governor’s ability to boost unemployment benefits amid a state emergency, something Cooper did after Helene. That could mean that North Carolinians won’t receive higher benefits in the future. But the law doesn’t include a provision that would withdraw any money that has already been allocated to people in the western part of the state. When Cooper made this statement, the bill had not yet become law, so his use of the past tense may have confused some North Carolinians.
It’s also worth noting that unemployment aid is far from the only way the state has been helping Helene victims. Beyond the immediate response that included hundreds of state and federal workers on the ground, the Republican-led state legislature has also approved more than $1 billion in Helene aid relief. That’s a fraction of the nearly $4 billion in aid Cooper called for while governor, though state lawmakers say they plan to do more in the future.
The power in question
Helene hit North Carolina on Sept. 27, bringing 30 inches of rain, causing more than 1,400 landslides. It was the deadliest and most damaging in state history. According to an estimate by the state’s budget director, Helene damaged about 74,000 western North Carolina homes — only about 5% of which were covered by flood insurance.
On Oct. 16, Cooper issued an executive order that raised the maximum weekly unemployment benefit from $350 per week to $600 per week and extended eligibility from 12 weeks to 26 weeks for Helene victims. Cooper cited powers granted to him under the state's Emergency Management Act when announcing the order. The increased amount was available to anyone seeking unemployment benefits in North Carolina — not just Helene victims.
Unemployment benefit payouts increased by more than 10,000 cases after Helene hit North Carolina, according to data provided by the state commerce department.
In August, 19,271 people received benefits. The number dipped to 17,981 in September, then shot up to 27,385 in October and rose to 31,547 by the end of the year.
Republican leaders don’t believe the Emergency Management Act authorizes the governor to boost unemployment benefits, so they included a section in Senate Bill 382 to ""correct a misapprehension of the powers conferred to the governor,"" the bill states. It also says the law ""does not allow for the governor to waive, modify, suspend, or fail to enforce or execute"" the laws related to employment security.
Cooper’s claim that Republicans ""took"" money out of western North Carolina could give the impression that money going to Helene victims, or that was scheduled to go to Helene victims, is being revoked. But that’s not so.
Delayed effect of the bill
The bill says the enhanced employment security benefits won’t end until March 1, when North Carolina’s state of emergency is scheduled to expire.
""This does not take money from Western North Carolina and does not impact a single dollar of unemployment benefits currently flowing to employees in that area,"" Lauren Horsch, a spokesperson for Republican Senate leader Phil Berger, told PolitiFact in a statement.

By Will Doran • March 7, 2016
Cooper’s office didn’t dispute that the bill leaves the current unemployment benefits untouched, but argued that Helene victims will likely still need the enhanced benefits after March 1, so withdrawing the governor’s ability to increase those payments will have significant consequences for people struggling to rebuild.
Gov. Josh Stein, also a Democrat, is expected to extend the state of emergency beyond March 1, Cooper’s office said last month, before Stein was sworn in. States of emergency for less-devastating hurricanes lasted longer than six months. For example, North Carolina was under a state of emergency for 15 months following 2018’s Hurricane Florence.
""Because Republican legislators are shortchanging western North Carolina recovery, especially the small business grants that are desperately needed to support the economy, residents out west will need enhanced unemployment benefits beyond next March,"" Cooper spokesperson Ben Conroy said.
""The Legislature's shameful decision to rip this power away from future governors only harms North Carolinians who need support to recover from this and future natural disasters,"" Conroy said.
Laura Brewer, a Stein spokesperson, told PolitiFact that the new governor hasn’t decided whether to extend the state of emergency, adding that there are many options ""to help them rebuild and recover, including support for those who have lost their jobs, homes, and businesses.""
Our ruling
Cooper said North Carolina Republicans ""took money out of western North Carolina"" when they passed a Hurricane Helene relief bill last month.
Legislators stripped the governor’s power to enhance unemployment benefits using the state’s Emergency Management Act. 
Cooper has a point in that if the state of emergency is extended without the bill in place, unemployed Helene victims could continue to receive enhanced benefits beyond March 1.
But the bill did not claw back or halt enhanced unemployment benefits that are scheduled to be available through March 1.

The relatively low similarity score of 0.28 suggests a weak relationship between the image and the claim, ""North Carolina Republicans “took money out of western North Carolina” with Hurricane Helene relief bill.""  Let's break down why:

The image itself is purely factual and data-driven. It doesn't inherently support or refute the claim's accusation of partisan favoritism or deliberate deprivation of funds to western North Carolina.  The connection, if any, is indirect and requires several inferential leaps.

Here's why the CLIP model might have assigned a ""Related"" classification, even with a low score:

* **Western NC presence:** The graph likely shows data for counties in western North Carolina, allowing for a visual comparison of their funding relative to other regions.  The presence of western NC counties on the graph establishes a basic connection to the claim's geographic focus.

* **Funding disparities (potential):**  Depending on the visual representation of the data (bar heights, coloring), the graph *might* reveal disparities in funding distribution.  If western NC counties receive noticeably less funding than others, this would offer a visual cue that subtly supports the claim, even if indirectly.  However, without seeing the actual graph details, this is speculative.

* **Contextual understanding limitation:** CLIP models lack the capacity for true contextual understanding. It identifies visual elements and text (if present) but struggles to interpret the nuanced political implications of the data displayed. It can't make the judgment call: ""Does this data show evidence of deliberate deprivation, or is the funding distribution explained by other factors?""

* **Low score explanation:** The low similarity score (0.28) strongly suggests that the visual evidence relating the image to the claim is weak or inconclusive.  Even if the graph shows lower funding in western NC, it doesn't inherently prove the claim of partisan manipulation. Other factors, such as damage assessment, population density, or pre-existing resource allocation formulas, could explain funding discrepancies.

In conclusion, the CLIP model's ""Related"" classification is likely due to the image's relevance to the geographic location mentioned in the claim. However, the low similarity score reflects the image's inability to directly support or refute the accusation of partisan actions.  The claim requires deeper analysis beyond a simple visual representation of funding distribution to be evaluated accurately.  The graph's actual data is crucial for assessing the validity of the claim.

But the order’s definitions of ""male"" and ""female"" led some social media users to wonder whether Trump accidentally categorized all people as women:

""Under Trump's executive order, every single person in America is now legally classified as female,"" a Jan. 21 X post read. ""All embryos begin by developing female sex organs, with male sex organs only replacing them at around 6 weeks of gestation.""

But scientific research and conversations with legal experts showed this claim was off base.
Early fetal development is not as straightforward as the post described. But neither was the wording in Trump’s executive order. It said:
""(d)  ‘Female’ means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell.
""(e)  ‘Male’ means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the small reproductive cell.""
Conception is when a sperm successfully fertilizes an egg, forming a zygote. The single-cell zygote possesses genetic coding related to sex —  typically XX (female) or XY (male) — but it cannot produce its own reproductive cells. 
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
In the first few weeks, a growing embryo has growing gonads that haven’t developed into male or female reproductive structures yet. Around six weeks, genetic coding triggers the growing embryo to start developing testes or ovaries.
Although scientists once theorized that all embryos start developing as females, recent research has determined that neither sex is ""default."" 
Scientists who considered the order said they were perplexed by its juxtaposing ""at conception"" alongside an aspect of sex differentiation that happens only after weeks of gestation. But legal experts were also leery of claims that interpreted the definition to mean all people would be ""legally classified"" as female.
The problem with the executive order’s definition
A person’s ""sex,"" according to scientists, is not easily measured by one factor. Chromosomes, gonads, hormones and genitalia can all contribute to a person’s sex categorization.
And those determinants are not all clear at conception. Nor do they always add up to typical male or typical female anatomy. Research estimates that about 1.7% of the population, for example, has intersex conditions or differences in sex development — cases in which someone’s anatomy does not neatly fit into male or female. 
People born with Klinefelter Syndrome, for example, have XXY chromosomes and although they are typically assigned male at birth, their anatomy is often affected by the additional female chromosome. People with de la Chapelle syndrome have female chromosomes but can develop a penis and be assigned male at birth. People with androgen insensitivity syndrome have male chromosomes, but don’t respond to their body’s naturally produced male hormones. That means genetically a male fetus, with testes and normal testosterone production may develop a vagina and be assigned female at birth and raised as a girl. 
Other conditions result in ambiguous genitalia that do not fall neatly into either sex category.
People with these conditions, therefore, are not accounted for under Trump’s order.
""A lot of other variations might be noticeable at birth if they cause other types of genital differences,"" said Sylvan Fraser Anthony, legal and policy director at Interact, a nonprofit advocating for intersex youth. ""Others will be discovered, you know, not until later.""
Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy officer for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, said political efforts to place people ""into two neat categories does not reflect biological reality."" 
""There are thousands of Americans whose chromosomes, external genitalia, and reproductive capacity do not match with some politician’s notion of how the world should be,"" Tipton said.
The problem with the claim that Trump’s order classifies everyone as female
The assertion that ""all embryos begin by developing female sex organs"" is based on outdated science. 
Scientists in the past theorized that female fetal development was the default pathway, stopped only by the activation of a Y chromosome gene that causes testes to develop. 
But recent research suggests that neither path is ""default"" and the development of both testes and ovaries is complex. More recent research describes reproductive structures in the first few weeks as ""bipotential,"" meaning they are not yet male or female.
Legal scholars also challenged the claim’s notion that Trump’s order would legally affect ""every single person’s"" sex.

“Fani Willis has just confessed to collusion with J6 committee.”
By Sofia Ahmed • January 24, 2025
""There is no such thing as a universal ‘legal’ gender,"" Rose Saxe, the American Civil Liberties Union’s LGBT & HIV Project’s deputy director, said.
State and federal governments’ understanding about a person’s sex and gender essentially depends on however official paperwork — birth certificates, driver’s licenses, passports — describes the person.
And Trump’s new definition of the sexes applies only to interpretation and enforcement of federal law and policy, not state laws. That could mean that people may no longer be able to change their gender markers — the ""M"" or ""F"" denoting male or female — on federal documents such as passports. But state IDs are governed by state laws, which may enable people in some states to get IDs that align with their gender identity. 
How the  Trump administration will enforce the order’s definition is also unclear: When  federal employees submit paperwork for example, Saxe said, will they be asked, ""‘Did you belong at conception to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell?’ Maybe that's what they're going to ask people, or are they just going to have a form that says male or female and ask people to check the box?""

And despite the definition’s wording, Saxe said, a court would be unlikely to adopt the interpretation that the law ""classifies"" everyone as female. 
These definitions might be short-lived. Within 30 days, the order dictates, ""the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall provide to the U.S. Government, external partners, and the public clear guidance expanding on the sex-based definitions set forth in this order."" 
Federal effort to define sex follows similar state-led efforts, but with new language
State lawmakers have so far led the charge to define and redefine sex and gender, and Trump’s effort follows suit. Nine states have explicitly defined sex as binary according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit that tracks LGBTQ+ policy.
Like Trump’s order, nearly all states adopting laws to redefine sex and gender have added definitions that refer to reproductive aspects of sex, the ability to produce sperm and eggs, as the dividing line between the sexes rather than chromosomes or genitalia 
But Trump’s order language is distinct from the state laws in its use of the phrase ""belonging, at conception,"" a likely nod to anti-abortion rights advocates.
During a Jan. 24 March for Life event in Washington D.C., abortion rights opponents celebrated Trump’s inclusion of the phrase ""at conception."" 
""I don’t know if you saw (Trump’s) executive order but it defines life as beginning at conceptions rather than birth,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told the crowd.

An X post said, ""Under Trump's executive order, every single person in America is now legally classified as female.""

The image from Politifact shows a diverse group of people, likely at a public event or protest.  There's nothing in the image directly related to a presidential executive order, gender classification, or even Donald Trump himself.

The CLIP model's classification of ""Unrelated"" with a low similarity score (0.18) is entirely justified because:

* **No textual or visual reference to the claim:** The image contains no text mentioning executive orders, gender classification, or anything remotely connected to the claim's core assertion.  There are no signs, banners, or other visual elements that allude to a change in legal gender classification.

* **Lack of contextual clues:** The image provides no contextual clues that would link it to the purported executive order.  It's a generic image of people, offering no indication of the time period, location, or the reason for their gathering.  This lack of context makes it impossible to connect the image to the claim's false premise.

* **The claim's inherent absurdity:** The claim itself is so patently false and nonsensical that finding an image related to it would be highly improbable.  No image could realistically depict a situation where everyone in America is legally classified as female because such a scenario is impossible.  The absurdity of the claim further contributes to the low similarity score.

In short, the image is a generic picture of people, whereas the claim is a specific and demonstrably false assertion about a nonexistent executive order.  There is no visual or textual overlap between the image and the content of the claim, hence the ""Unrelated"" classification and the low similarity score.  The CLIP model correctly identifies the complete lack of connection between the two.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a low similarity score (0.25) is understandable given the weak connection between the image and the claim.

Here's a breakdown:

* **The Claim:**  The claim is a factual assertion about a specific policy enacted by President Trump – nationwide concealed carry reciprocity.  It's a concrete statement about a particular action and its legal ramifications.

* **The Image:** The image is a generic shot of Donald Trump speaking. There's no mention of concealed carry, gun laws, or any specific policy announcement related to this topic.  The image provides no visual context to support or refute the claim.  It simply shows Trump in a typical public speaking setting.

**Why the low similarity score and ""Related"" classification?**

The low similarity score (0.25) reflects the weak visual connection. CLIP likely establishes a link because:

* **Donald Trump's presence:** The image features Donald Trump, who is directly mentioned in the claim.  This is the primary reason for the ""Related"" classification. The model recognizes the person in the image and links it to the person named in the claim.

* **Contextual Inference (Weak):** CLIP might attempt some weak contextual inference.  Public speaking events often involve announcements, and Trump's presidency involved many policy decisions.  However, this is a very weak connection, as the image gives no indication of the specific policy being discussed.

The low score indicates that the connection is tenuous. The model acknowledges the presence of Trump, linking it to the claim, but lacks strong visual evidence supporting the specific claim about nationwide concealed carry reciprocity.  The image is far too generic to provide any meaningful visual confirmation of the claim.  A much stronger image would show Trump signing a bill, holding a document related to the policy, or speaking specifically about this topic.

Among the fabricated headlines on SpaceX Fanclub, a Facebook page that notes ""nothing on this page is real,"" is this one from Nov. 28, 2024: ""Elon Musk promises major shake-up at MSNBC, vows to fire Reid - satire.""
The Facebook post about Musk vowing to fire Reid to ‘end toxicity’ lacks such a satire label.

The low similarity score of 0.28 from CLIP indicates a weak relationship between the image and the claim.  This is understandable for several reasons:

* **Lack of Explicit Connection:** The image itself doesn't visually represent the claim of Musk acquiring MSNBC and firing Reid. There's no visual representation of MSNBC branding, legal documents, or any indication of a business transaction.  The image simply juxtaposes the two individuals.

* **Manipulated Nature:** The image is clearly a digitally altered composite. This artificiality reduces the image's connection to reality and the claim, which presents itself as a factual news item. CLIP may struggle to link a fabricated image to a real-world event claim.

* **Ambiguous Context:** The juxtaposition of Musk and Reid alone doesn't inherently suggest a hostile takeover or firing. It could be interpreted in many ways, not necessarily reflecting the claim's specific narrative.  The lack of contextual clues within the image itself weakens the connection.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The 0.28 score itself strongly suggests a weak relationship.  CLIP uses a scale where higher scores indicate stronger similarity.  0.28 is closer to ""unrelated"" than ""related,"" indicating that the model only finds a very subtle visual connection. This connection likely stems from the mere presence of the two individuals' faces, a very basic visual element that doesn't capture the essence of the claim.

In summary, CLIP likely classified the image as ""related"" based on the minimal visual overlap – the presence of recognizable images of Elon Musk and Joy Reid.  However, the lack of any visual elements supporting the claim's core elements (MSNBC acquisition, firing, ""ending toxicity"") results in a very low similarity score. The fabricated nature of the image and the absence of crucial context further weaken the connection. The overall relationship is superficial at best and not reflective of the claim's specific assertion.

The Better Business Bureau has warned about these kinds of bait-and-switch scams before. They work like this: Someone is scrolling through Facebook and sees a post about a wanted serial killer (or, as we’ve previously reported, a missing or found-and-bruised child). The person shares the post. But after the person shares the post, the scammer changes the post to something like a deceptive rental ad. 
""These bait-and-switch ads aim to either get a deposit for a rental property before the user gets a chance to see the home—or get your personal information, which could lead to identity theft,"" the Better Business Bureau said in a November 2024 article on its website. ""This scheme has many variations, but the commonality is the emotionality or urgency of the message that encourages concerned people to share the news with their friends."" 
We rate claims that images show a purported on-the-loose serial killer named Jeffrey Thomas False.",FALSE,image_81.jpg,https://vicksburgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Farm-Share-Scam.png.webp,Related,0.2581145763397217,"The image URL points to an article image from Vicksburg News concerning a farm share scam.  The image itself depicts a photo of a check, a portion of a document, and what seems to be a partially visible hand holding a pen.  There is text visible on the check and document, but it's not legible enough to determine specific details.  There is no person resembling Jeffrey Thomas, or any person at all, that is readily identifiable.

Given the claim ""Photos show Jeffrey Thomas, a ‘serial killer on the loose’,"" the CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a low similarity score of 0.26 is entirely understandable and justifiable.  The disconnect is massive.

Here's why the low similarity and ""Related"" classification are likely:

* **Absence of Jeffrey Thomas:** The image contains no visible representation of any individual, let alone someone matching a description of Jeffrey Thomas. The claim explicitly mentions photographs *showing* him. This crucial element is missing.

* **Contextual Mismatch:** The image's context, clearly related to a financial crime (farm share scam), is completely unrelated to the claim of a serial killer on the loose.  The subject matter is drastically different.

* **Low-Level Visual Similarities (Speculation):**  The ""Related"" classification, despite the low score, might be due to very weak, low-level visual similarities detected by CLIP. These could be:
    * **Presence of text:** Both the claim and the image contain text.  However, the content is entirely different.
    * **Document-like nature:** Both a mugshot (implied by the claim) and the check in the image are forms of documentation. This very broad, generic similarity might contribute minimally to the weak correlation.

In essence, the CLIP model likely identified a minuscule, superficial commonality between the abstract concept of ""document containing information"" and the broad semantic category of the claim, resulting in a very low similarity score and a tentative ""Related"" classification rather than ""Unrelated.""  The lack of any direct visual connection between the image and the claim significantly overrides any weak visual similarities.  The classification highlights a limitation of CLIP in dealing with complex relationships between textual and visual information, particularly when the disconnect is as stark as in this case.

The account claimed that its operators had talked to 25 Republican U.S. senators who were willing to convict Trump over his pardons for people convicted of crimes related to the Jan. 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol. 
The post had been shared more than 17,000 times and viewed more than 14 million times as of Jan. 24.

There are no credible news stories that support the account’s claims. We contacted senators in Republican leadership for comment but received no replies by deadline. 
Trump on Jan. 20, his first day back in office, pardoned or commuted the sentences of more than 1,500 people convicted of crimes over the Capitol attack. Although some Republicans have criticized the sweeping clemency, we found no examples of Senate Republicans endorsing a Trump impeachment. 
Some Republicans bristled at the choice to pardon people who violently assaulted police officers. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said people who assaulted officers ""should do the time,"" Politico reported. 
Politico reported that Sens. Thom Thillis, R-N.C., Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, also expressed disappointment in Trump’s decision. Cassidy, Murkowski and Collins were among seven Republicans who voted in 2021 to convict Trump over his role in the Capitol uprising.
Newsweek reported on one organization’s push for another Trump impeachment, but we see no signs Republicans will support that.
The Democratic-led House impeached Trump twice during his first term: first after he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to investigate Joe Biden and his son, and again on a charge of inciting an insurrection at the Capitol. The Senate acquitted him both times. 
Other social media posts in the days since Trump’s inauguration have made unsubstantiated claims of a growing impeachment movement. X posts claiming that Reps. Alexandria Ocaso-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Jamie Raskin, D-Md., filed articles of impeachment against Trump emerged Jan. 24. But the pair did no such thing. 
We found no examples of federal officeholders from either party saying Trump’s pardons were grounds for impeachment. With Republicans controlling the House, it’s almost certain an impeachment effort would fail in the chamber.
Twenty Republican senators would need to side with all Democrats to convict Trump on impeachment charges. All but six of the 43 senators who voted against convicting Trump in 2021 are still in office, and three of the seven Republicans who voted to convict him are in office. If history is any indication, there is no support in the conference to convict Trump.

Account has history of misleading posts
The X account that posted the claim, Politics Video, and its associated website, have a history of making false, misleading and unsubstantiated claims that are critical of Trump and Republicans.
The account speculated at least eight times in January that the majority-Republican Congress might impeach Trump. The posts similarly used purported anonymous sources that aren’t found in any credible reporting. 
In December, the account claimed that then-Vice President Kamala Harris is ""legally allowed to reject the certification of Trump’s election because of January 6."" That’s not true; the vice president’s role in certifying an election is purely ministerial.
The X account was created in February 2016, and its first public post is from December 2017. A 2020 International Business Times India article used Twitter application programming interface tools to determine that before the 2016 election, the same account, under a different username, was called CNN Breaking News, and it posted fake news and misleading information from a conservative perspective.
A 2024 FactCheck.org article found that the Politics Video Channel website was associated with an Australian email address.

An X post said the Senate ""has the votes to remove Trump from office if the House votes to impeach.""

The similarity score of 0.28, while not high, suggests a weak but discernible relationship between the image and the claim.  Let's break down why CLIP might have classified it as ""Related"":

* **Textual Alignment:** The most significant factor contributing to the ""Related"" classification is the presence of text in the image directly referencing the Senate and Trump's potential removal.  While the exact wording doesn't perfectly match the claim, the core concept – the Senate's role in a potential Trump removal following House impeachment – is clearly present.  CLIP likely recognized key words and phrases related to the claim's subject matter, such as ""Senate,"" ""Trump,"" and implied concepts of impeachment and removal.

* **Contextual Understanding:** CLIP, while not fully understanding the nuances of political processes, probably connected the visual context (a news screen displaying a political story) with the semantic meaning of the claim. The image's subject matter is directly relevant to the claim's topic, even if it doesn't definitively confirm or deny the claim's truthfulness.

* **Low Similarity Score Explanation:** The relatively low similarity score (0.28) indicates that the match is not strong. This is likely due to several factors:

    * **Absence of explicit confirmation:** The image doesn't explicitly state ""The U.S. Senate *has* the votes...""  It presents news about the Senate's potential role, leaving the question of sufficient votes open.
    * **Visual Ambiguity:** The image is primarily textual; there are no visual cues beyond the headline that strongly reinforce the claim.  CLIP relies heavily on visual features, and the lack of compelling visuals weakens the correlation.
    * **News Headline Nature:** News headlines often present information concisely, implying rather than explicitly stating facts. This implicit nature makes it more difficult for CLIP to establish a strong connection with a precise claim.


In summary, CLIP likely associated the image with the claim due to the presence of relevant keywords and the contextual understanding of the image as a news report concerning a topic directly related to the claim. However, the low similarity score reflects the lack of explicit confirmation and the limited visual information within the image that directly supports the claim's assertion about the Senate possessing sufficient votes. The relationship is more about thematic relevance than precise factual agreement.

“FEMA sent $59M LAST WEEK to luxury hotels in New York City to house illegal migrants… That money is meant for American disaster relief.”
By Maria Ramirez Uribe • February 14, 2025
On the first day of his second term, Trump signed a slew of executive orders, many of which were geared toward limiting immigration. 
These orders included directing Defense Department and Homeland Security secretaries to ""finish the wall"" along the nation’s southern border; directing the Defense Department secretary to deploy personnel to the southern border; ending parole programs for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans; and ending birthright citizenship —  the nation’s longstanding practice of granting automatic citizenship to people born in the U.S. 
Many of these actions are likely to face legal challenges. A federal judge on Jan. 23 temporarily blocked Trump’s birthright citizenship order from taking effect.
But this video doesn’t show traffic on roads heading to Mexico because of mass deportations ordered by Trump. We rate that claim False.",FALSE,image_83.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GiBuFSdWwAEfYS2?format=jpg&name=small,Unrelated,0.2353485226631164,"The CLIP model's classification of ""Unrelated"" with a similarity score of 0.24 between the claim ""Video shows 'roads heading to Mexico are jam packed as mass deportations have started.'"" and the provided image is highly justified.  The image shows a relatively uncongested highway scene. There's no visual evidence suggesting a mass exodus or significant traffic congestion consistent with mass deportations.

Let's break down why the classification makes sense:

* **Lack of Crowding:** The image depicts a stretch of highway with several vehicles visible, but the traffic flow appears normal or only mildly busy, not jammed or congested as the claim suggests. There are no visible traffic jams or significant backups. The spacing between cars is relatively consistent.

* **Absence of Deportation Indicators:**  There are no visible signs indicating any organized movement of people consistent with mass deportations.  No buses, convoys, or large groups of individuals on foot or in any form of organized transportation are apparent. The vehicles in the image look like typical passenger cars and trucks, not specialized transport vehicles often associated with large-scale movements of people.

* **Generic Highway Scene:** The image is a fairly generic shot of a highway.  There's nothing distinctive or unusual about the scene itself.  It lacks any context that would directly link it to border crossings, deportation activities, or any large-scale human movement.

* **Low CLIP Similarity Score:** The low similarity score of 0.24 further reinforces the model's assessment. This score indicates a significant lack of visual overlap between the image's content and the concepts conveyed in the claim (mass deportations, jammed roads).  The model likely found little to no visual evidence in the image to support the claim.

In summary, the image depicts a relatively normal highway scene, lacking any visual elements that would corroborate the claim of mass deportations causing heavily congested roads heading to Mexico.  The CLIP model's classification accurately reflects this discrepancy between the claim and the visual content of the image.  The low similarity score further quantifies this lack of visual correlation.

FEMA has been funding migrants’ food, shelter and transportation through two programs that give money to nonprofit organizations and state and local governments.

The claim states that $2 billion in emergency funds has been redirected from welfare programs for undocumented immigrants to FEMA for use in North Carolina.  The claimed reason is that undocumented immigrants ""don't be needing it.""

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.40 is likely due to the contextual association between the image and the claim.  While there's no direct visual evidence in the image supporting the claim (no FEMA presence or indication of the origin of funds is shown), the image depicts a situation *precisely where FEMA's emergency funds would be needed*.

The model connects the visual representation of a disaster-stricken area (needing emergency aid) with the claim about the allocation of emergency funds.  The relatively low similarity score (0.40) suggests the connection is not strong visually, as there's no explicit visual representation of the claim's content.  The relationship is entirely inferred: the image shows a need, and the claim describes the potential provision (or redirection) of resources to meet that need.

In essence, the model recognizes a thematic link. The image depicts the *consequence* (disaster requiring aid), while the claim describes a potential *cause* (redistribution of funds for disaster relief). The weak correlation stems from the lack of direct visual evidence confirming the claim's specifics within the image itself.  The model is associating the general concept of disaster relief with the general concept of funds being allocated for disaster relief, rather than making a direct visual match.

Florida rarely experiences snow-related emergencies requiring a presidential declaration.  The image shows President Trump at a press conference, and the classification by CLIP as ""Related"" with a similarity score of 0.26 reflects a weak connection based on superficial features rather than factual accuracy.

Let's break down why the relatively low similarity score of 0.26 makes sense:

* **Absence of Snow-Related Context:** The image shows a typical press conference setting. There's no visible snow, no mention of snow in any visible text, and no imagery suggesting a snow emergency.  The image alone provides no evidence to support the claim.

* **Presence of President Trump:** The image's main focus is President Trump.  Since the claim involves President Trump, CLIP likely picked up on this shared element, contributing to the weak positive correlation. This is a purely visual link, not a semantic one related to the claim's substance.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The 0.26 score highlights the weak relationship.  It indicates that while CLIP detects President Trump in both the claim's context and the image, it doesn't find significant contextual overlap to support the specific claim about a snow-related emergency.  The score reflects the lack of supporting evidence in the image.

* **CLIP's Limitations:** CLIP is a multimodal model; it correlates visual content with textual descriptions.  It doesn't possess factual knowledge or the ability to verify the truthfulness of statements. It simply identifies visual and textual similarities, even if those similarities are ultimately unrelated to the claim's veracity.  The model connects the presence of Trump in the image to the mention of Trump in the claim, ignoring the entirely false premise regarding snow in Florida.

In summary, the ""Related"" classification with a low similarity score demonstrates CLIP's limitations in discerning truth from falsehood. It identifies a superficial visual connection (the presence of President Trump) while failing to grasp the semantic disconnect between the image content and the inherently false claim.  The low score accurately reflects the weak and ultimately irrelevant relationship between the image and the false statement.

The relatively low similarity score of 0.35 from CLIP suggests a weak correlation between the image and the claim ""CBS Evening News anchor Norah O’Donnell was fired.""  While the image directly depicts O'Donnell, it doesn't provide any information about her employment status.

Here's a breakdown of why the CLIP model might have assigned a 'Related' classification with a low score:

* **Visual Confirmation of Subject:** The image's primary relevance stems from its clear depiction of Norah O'Donnell.  This is why it's not classified as 'Unrelated'. CLIP recognizes her face and associates it with the claim mentioning her name.

* **Lack of Contextual Information:** The image lacks any text or visual cues indicating termination or dismissal.  There are no news headlines, logos, or captions suggesting she was fired. The image is simply a portrait, devoid of context relevant to the claim.

* **Low Semantic Relationship:** The claim focuses on an event (firing), while the image provides only visual identification.  CLIP struggles to bridge the gap between a static image and a dynamic event. The image alone doesn't convey the action or consequence of being fired.

* **Similarity Score Reflects Weak Correlation:**  The score of 0.35 signifies a weak relationship.  CLIP likely identifies O’Donnell but finds little in the image directly supporting the claim of her termination. A higher score would require visual evidence of a news report about her firing, perhaps a screenshot of a news article.

In essence, the image is relevant only insofar as it visually confirms the identity of the person mentioned in the claim.  The absence of any information related to her employment status limits the strength of the relationship, resulting in the low similarity score. The model correctly identifies O'Donnell but fails to make the leap to inferring her firing based on the image alone.  More contextual information would be needed for a higher similarity score.

"Donald Trump
stated on January 22, 2025 in an interview:","The U.S. House Select Committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol “deleted and destroyed all of the information that they collected over two years.”","stated on January 22, 2025 in an interview:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/jan/24/donald-trump/donald-trump-goes-too-far-in-claim-that-jan-6-comm/,,"In his first Oval Office TV interview since his second-term inauguration, President Donald Trump repeated a claim he’s said for months: that the U.S. House Select Committee that investigated him for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol attack deleted ""all"" evidence.

""What they did was criminal, that’s why they got pardoned,"" Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity Jan. 22, referring to former President Joe Biden’s preemptive presidential pardons for committee members such as former Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., and U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss. ""They deleted and destroyed all of the information that they collected over two years."" 
Trump continued: ""And you know why? Because it proved I was right. All of that information was deleted and destroyed. They deleted all of the information having to do with the 10,000 soldiers that I offered to Nancy Pelosi, and she's now on tape admitting it."" (That’s a distortion of what Pelosi said.)
Trump made a similar statement shortly after his Jan. 20 swearing in, saying in a postinaugural speech that the U.S. House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the U.S. Capitol, ""destroyed all evidence, they deleted everything, there’s virtually nothing left."" In the Oval Office later that day, he again claimed committee members ""destroyed all of the documents, they deleted all of the information, there’s no information.""
Republicans and Democrats have long argued over the committee's records and whether certain information should have been archived. But there’s no basis for Trump’s claim that ""all"" of the evidence was deleted and destroyed.

Committee members — seven Democrats and two Republicans — said some videos and sensitive material were not included in the archive to protect witnesses, but that everything else was properly saved, including more than 100 testimony transcripts, depositions and documents that remain publicly available online.

Trump’s statements about Jan. 6, 2021, are back in the news because the day he took office he pardoned nearly all of the people convicted for their actions in the attack and commuted the sentences of 14 others.

On Jan. 22, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., announced a new select subcommittee chaired by Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., ""to continue our efforts to uncover the full truth"" about Jan. 6.

A Trump spokesperson declined to comment. In a 2023 court filing, Trump’s lawyers argued that some committee evidence was missing, but they didn’t say ""all"" evidence was destroyed.
Trump’s statements about evidence being destroyed are part of his and his allies’ long-standing, two-pronged response to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack: They downplay what happened that day while arguing that the committee covered up its investigation into the day’s events.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
How claims about evidence destruction first surfaced
The Jan. 6 select committee concluded its work in December 2022 with an 845-page final report. It detailed Trump’s effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election, the catalyst for the Capitol attack. The committee voted unanimously to recommend charges against Trump to the Justice Department.

Much of the committee’s work is available online. During its 18-month investigation, the group held 10 public hearings, interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses and collected more than 1 million documents. It released more than 100 transcripts of testimony, plus memos and emails, and videos, depositions and documents that are still publicly available online.

Pages of the executive summary from the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, are photographed Dec. 19, 2022, in Washington. (AP)

In June 2023, Loudermilk wrote to Thompson, the committee's chair, saying that some of the committee’s materials were not archived, namely video recordings of the interviews that had written transcripts.

Thompson’s July 2023 reply said more than 1 million records had been archived in coordination with the National Archives and Records Administration and the Committee on House Administration.

The committee sent some information deemed private and sensitive to the White House and Department of Homeland Security for archiving, Thompson wrote, to ensure that no information was released improperly. The committee dissolved before a full review of the materials was complete.
  The material sent to the executive branch, Thompson wrote, contained ""law enforcement sensitive operational details and private, personal information that, if released, could endanger the safety of witnesses.""
  As for videos not being included, Thompson said the committee followed House rules by providing transcripts of the interviews. House Rule VII outlines the requirements for preserving House records at the end of each two-year term.
  What was in a subsequent House Republican report?
House Republicans in early 2023 opened their own investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, deeming the select committee’s work ""incomplete.""
In March 2024, the House Administation’s Subcommittee on Oversight, led by Loudermilk, released its first findings report, which accused the Jan. 6 committee of deleting records and promoting a political narrative against Trump instead of investigating the Capitol’s security failures.
The report included newly released testimony and said the Jan. 6 committee ""failed to archive and subsequently provide the subcommittee any of its video recordings of witness interviews, as many as 900 interview summaries or transcripts, more than one terabyte of digital data, and over 100 deleted or encrypted documents.""
The files were deleted days before Republicans took over the House majority in January 2023, the report said.
House Republicans said they intended to release a final report Jan. 6, 2025. No such report had been made public as of Jan. 24. PolitiFact contacted Loudermilk’s office to ask about the report’s status, but did not hear back by publication.
Just as he did in his comments to Hannity, Trump regularly references what he says was deleted or ""destroyed"" evidence involving ""10,000 soldiers."" But in March we looked into this claim and rated it False.
That’s because it involved an interview that was initially withheld from the public record while the Department of Homeland Security reviewed it for security concerns. The testimony said Trump floated the number of ""10,000"" National Guard troops but it didn’t substantiate Trump’s claim that he had ordered any deployment.
Trump lawyers sought subpoenas for some committee records
The Jan. 6 committee records discussion arose in the federal government’s prosecution of Trump for election subversion preceding the attack; the case was dropped after Trump won the 2024 election.

Records from the case show that Trump’s lawyers sought what they considered to be ""missing records,"" filing an Oct. 11, 2023, motion that cited Loudermilk’s June 2023 letter that had said some of the committee’s materials, namely videos, were not archived. The motion did not go as far as Trump’s recent statement that  ""all"" records from the entire investigation were destroyed. Instead, it said certain records weren’t archived or transferred to the Committee on House Administration, such as video recordings of transcribed interviews, depositions and intelligence information.
The Trump motion said he wanted ""to determine if these records have been lost, destroyed, or altered.""
Smith wrote in a response that the government had already provided Trump with select committee records and that those his motion identified were a ""small number of transcripts"" of interviews conducted subject to confidentiality agreements.

The relatively low similarity score (0.34) indicates a weak relationship.

The image shows a pamphlet summarizing the findings of the January 6th Committee's final report.  Key elements that contribute to the ""Related"" classification include:

* **Mention of the January 6th Committee:** The pamphlet explicitly refers to the House Select Committee investigating the January 6th attack, directly connecting it to the claim.  This is the strongest element linking the image to the claim.

* **Presentation of Findings:** The pamphlet's purpose is to disseminate the committee's findings.  This implies the existence of collected information, which directly contradicts the claim of complete data deletion and destruction. The existence of the pamphlet itself is evidence *against* the claim.

However, several factors contribute to the low similarity score and the weak relationship:

* **The Claim's Negativity:** The claim asserts *destruction* of information.  The image, showcasing the *preservation* and *dissemination* of information, is inherently contradictory. The visual elements of the pamphlet don't directly depict the act of deletion.

* **Lack of Visual Clues:** The image doesn't show any evidence of data deletion or destruction. There are no visual cues suggesting data erasure.  CLIP relies heavily on visual information, and the absence of such cues weakens the relationship.

* **Contextual Understanding:**  CLIP lacks the ability to fully understand the nuances of the claim. It can recognize keywords and concepts like ""January 6th Committee"" and ""report,"" but it cannot fully grasp the implications of the statement regarding complete data destruction.  The relationship is established solely on keyword matching and contextual association, not a deep semantic understanding.

In summary, the ""Related"" classification is based primarily on the presence of the January 6th Committee's name and the presentation of the committee's report in the image.  However, the low similarity score reflects the fundamental conflict between the image's content (evidence of information *preservation*) and the claim's assertion of information *destruction*.  The classification is a superficial connection, highlighting the limitations of relying solely on visual analysis without contextual understanding. A human would instantly recognize the contradiction and assign a much lower relevance score.

Let's analyze why this is the case, considering the claim and the image.

The claim states that a video shows immigrants in Mexico heading towards a checkpoint in El Paso, Texas, intending to forcibly enter the US due to the CBP One app being down.  This implies a specific event, a crowd of people moving purposefully towards a border crossing, potentially exhibiting some level of agitation or urgency.

The image from the Los Angeles Times shows a group of people at what appears to be a border crossing area. However, it lacks crucial details needed to support the claim.  The specific elements that contribute to the low similarity score include:

* **Lack of clear intent:** The image does not show the people actively trying to breach the border forcefully. They appear to be gathered in a group, but their actions and intentions are not evident.  The claim suggests a forceful entry attempt, while the image shows a more ambiguous scene.

* **Absence of context:**  The image lacks any information suggesting the CBP One app was down or that this event is directly related to its malfunction.  The claim directly links the immigrants' actions to a specific technological failure, a detail absent from the image.

* **Ambiguous location:** While the image seems to depict a border crossing, it doesn't definitively show El Paso, Texas.  The claim specifies the location, which is not verifiable from the image alone.

* **General nature of the image:** The image is a fairly generic representation of people at a border crossing. This kind of imagery could accompany many different news stories, not just one specifically about a forced entry attempt linked to a technological failure of a specific app.

The low similarity score (0.26) reflects the lack of concrete visual evidence in the image to support the specific details mentioned in the claim.  The image might be *related* to the general topic of immigration at the US-Mexico border, but it doesn't visually corroborate the claim's specifics regarding forced entry and the CBP One app outage.  The model correctly identifies a loose connection, but highlights the insufficient visual evidence to confidently link the image to the described event.

The video from Trump’s Truth social account showed Willis testifying during a Feb. 15, 2024, court hearing that would determine whether she should remain on Georgia's election interference case against Trump.

Her role in the prosecution came under scrutiny because of her romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, a special prosecutor Willis had hired and who had withdrawn from the election interference case. In the full nearly 14-minute video posted on Trump’s account, Willis didn’t admit to colluding with the Jan. 6 committee.

The claim appears to originate from Judicial Watch, a conservative group that sued Willis for not disclosing correspondence she may have had with the Jan. 6 committee or then-U.S. special counsel Jack Smith. Smith led federal investigations into Trump’s handling of classified documents and attempts to hold onto power after the 2020 elections. Smith resigned from the Justice Department in January before Trump’s second presidential inauguration.
Judicial Watch released a video Dec. 11 titled, ""Fani Willis confesses!"" In the video, Tom Fitton, Judicial Watch’s president, said Willis confessed to having communication records with the Jan. 6 committee, which he said ""confirms she was in collusion"" with it.

The image, a headshot of Fani Willis, shows nothing that visually supports or refutes the claim.

Here's a breakdown of why the low similarity score and ""Unrelated"" classification are appropriate:

* **Absence of Supporting Evidence:** The image contains only a portrait of Fani Willis. There's no text, background elements, or other visual cues suggesting collusion with the January 6th committee.  The claim requires evidence of a confession and collusion; the image provides neither.

* **Neutral Context:** The photograph is a standard headshot – a neutral portrait often used in news articles and official contexts.  It offers no contextual information related to the claim of confession or collusion.  It doesn't depict her interacting with anyone, nor does it show any documents or objects that would hint at such an activity.

* **CLIP's Focus on Visual Similarity:** CLIP is a multimodal model; it analyzes the visual content of the image and compares it to the textual description of the claim.  Since the image provides no visual information related to the assertion of confession and collusion with the J6 committee, the similarity score is understandably low.  The model doesn't interpret facial expressions or inferred meanings; it matches based on direct visual content.

* **Low Similarity Score Interpretation:** A score of 0.23 indicates a very weak correlation between the image and the text.  In CLIP's scoring system, a score closer to 1 signifies a strong match, while a score closer to 0 indicates a lack of visual relationship.  0.23 firmly falls into the ""Unrelated"" category.


In summary, the image is simply a picture of Fani Willis.  The claim alleges a specific action (confession and collusion) with supporting evidence that is entirely absent from the provided photograph.  Therefore, the CLIP model's assessment is accurate, reflecting the lack of visual connection between the image and the claim.  The claim would require documentary evidence, witness testimony, or other forms of proof, none of which are present in the image.

He's clearly identifiable, dressed in his characteristic attire.  There's no text in the image directly stating he's leaving the Democratic Party.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a low similarity score (0.31) is likely due to the image's association with Senator Fetterman himself.  The claim focuses on a significant political action (switching parties), while the image only shows Fetterman's presence.  The low similarity score reflects the weak connection.

Here's a breakdown of why the relationship is weak but still classified as ""related"":

* **Visual association:** The image is directly relevant to Senator Fetterman.  Any image containing him would have *some* level of relation to a claim about him.  CLIP identifies the subject as Fetterman, which is a fundamental part of the claim.

* **Lack of contextual information:** The image provides no information about a party switch.  It doesn't show him with members of another party, displaying a different party logo, or making any statement about his political affiliation.  The image is purely descriptive; it shows Fetterman, but doesn't support or contradict the claim.

* **Low similarity score:** The 0.31 score explicitly indicates a weak relationship.  This score suggests that while the image contains the relevant individual, it lacks the visual cues to directly support or refute the claim. A higher score would imply a stronger visual correlation, such as an image of Fetterman at a Republican event or signing a document indicating a party switch.

In summary, the relationship is based solely on the presence of Senator Fetterman in the image.  The image itself doesn't contribute to the truth or falsehood of the claim, hence the low similarity score despite the ""Related"" classification.  CLIP likely associates the image with the claim based on the subject matter (Fetterman) rather than the claim's content (party switch).

""He just reversed all the cost caps Biden negotiated for anyone on Medicare or Medicaid, over 120 MILLION Americans,"" one image of an X post posted on Facebook said. 
The post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)
Among the flurry of executive orders Trump signed Jan. 20, one order revoked dozens of Biden’s past executive orders and memos, including one aimed at lowering prescription drug prices. 
The change reversed Biden’s direction to the Health and Human Services Department to develop pilot plans to reduce Medicare and Medicaid prescription drug costs. Those plans had not taken effect before Trump took office, but revoking the executive order did not immediately shut them down. 
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
It did not reverse the cost savings Biden signed into law in the Inflation Reduction Act, which allowed Medicare to negotiate the price of drugs, capped insulin costs for Medicare recipients at $35 a month and capped out-of-pocket drug costs for Medicare recipients. 
Since Congress passed those changes, only an act of Congress can undo them. 
Trump’s orders ""simply say that the current president doesn't agree with the past one's political statements issued as executive orders,"" said Joseph Antos, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. ""If anyone wants to change the law, Congress has to pass a new law making that change.""
The prices that Medicare negotiated for the first 10 drugs under the Inflation Reduction Act will take effect in 2026. The Biden administration announced the next set of drugs that Medicare will negotiate for on Jan. 17, which will take effect in 2027. That timeline will not be affected by the removal of Biden’s executive order.  
The executive order, which Biden signed in October 2022, had not spurred any lower drug prices by the time Trump revoked it Jan. 20. 
The order directed the Health and Human Services Department secretary to consider ""new health care payment and delivery models"" for the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to test. 
The department settled on three plans: 
A voluntary program for Medicare Part D providers to offer copayments of less than $2 a month for a list of common generic drugs.
A program to improve access to cell and gene therapies for Medicaid recipients.
A plan to speed up approval of new drugs.
With the executive order revoked, it’s unclear what will become of those proposals.
Trump’s Health and Human Services Department could build on them or develop similar policies aimed at lowering drug prices, but his administration has not announced any steps to do so.

By Sofia Ahmed • February 18, 2025
In a statement to PolitiFact, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly did not say whether Trump will keep developing those programs, but she said he ""will continue to deliver on his promise to make healthcare affordable for Americans.""  
During his first term, Trump signed executive orders aimed at lowering drug costs under Medicare, lowering insulin and epinephrine costs for low-income people, and allowing the import of certain drugs. PolitiFact reported at the time the potential savings of those programs weren't clear, and they also failed to materialize before Biden took office. 
Biden canceled and delayed implementation of the Trump administration's rules aimed at drug prices. 
Revoking Biden’s order did not raise drug prices for anyone, since the plans had not taken effect yet. But it does mean, if Trump’s administration cancels those programs, their potential drug price reductions won’t be realized, said Mariana Socal, a Johns Hopkins University professor who specializes in drug prices. The gene therapy plan may have also improved access to therapies that Medicaid patients can’t now receive. 
""Patients will not see their savings that they could see under these programs, but they also might not see an extension in access that could be happening under these programs,"" she said.
Our ruling
A Facebook post said Trump ""reversed all the cost caps Biden negotiated for anyone on Medicare or Medicaid."" 
Trump revoked an executive order calling for the Health and Human Services Department to develop plans to lower prescription drug prices, and Trump’s administration is unlikely to continue pursuing those plans.
The change does not reverse any policy that lowered drug prices, but it signaled the administration may not advance existing pilot projects that aimed to do so. 
The cap on insulin and out-of-pocket drug costs and negotiated drug prices for Medicare recipients, which Biden championed and signed into law in the Inflation Reduction Act, won’t be affected by Trump’s decision to revoke Biden’s order.

The relatively low similarity score of 0.27 from CLIP suggests a weak connection between the image and the claim ""President Donald Trump 'just reversed all the cost caps Biden negotiated for anyone on Medicare or Medicaid.'""  The weakness stems from the fact that the image provides no visual evidence supporting or refuting the claim.

Here's a breakdown of why the connection is weak despite the ""Related"" classification:

* **Lack of Specific Context:** The image only shows Trump signing executive orders. There's no mention of Medicare, Medicaid, cost caps, or Biden.  The image alone offers no information about the *content* of the executive orders being signed.  The orders could be about anything.  The visual information is entirely generic to the act of a president signing documents.

* **Ambiguity of Action:**  While the image shows Trump performing an action (signing executive orders),  it doesn't show *what* those executive orders are about.  The claim refers to a specific policy action (reversing cost caps).  The image, lacking textual information detailing the content of the orders, cannot verify or disprove this specific claim.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The 0.27 score from CLIP reinforces the weak connection.  This score indicates only a minimal visual overlap between the image's features (Trump, Oval Office, signing documents) and the conceptual elements of the claim (Medicare, Medicaid, cost caps, Biden, policy reversal).  The algorithm likely picked up on the presence of Trump and the presidential context, but that alone is insufficient to confirm the claim's accuracy.

In summary, the ""Related"" classification is likely due to the image featuring President Trump in a context related to policy decisions. However, the image itself provides no information directly relevant to the specifics of the claim about reversing Medicare and Medicaid cost caps.  The low similarity score appropriately reflects this lack of strong visual evidence supporting the claim. The connection is purely circumstantial and based on the general subject matter (Trump and executive orders) rather than concrete visual proof of the claimed policy reversal.

During his Jan. 20 speech at Washington, D.C.’s Capital One Arena, Musk thanked the crowd for electing President Donald Trump.
As he offered thanks, Musk put his right hand to his heart, then extended his hand to the crowd with his palm at a 45-degree angle. He turned around and repeated the gesture.
""Thank you for making it happen,"" Musk said. ""Thank you. My heart goes out to you. It is thanks to you that the future of civilization is assured.""
Online commentators compared Musk’s gesture with the Nazi salute under Adolf Hitler. Others compared it with the ""Roman salute,"" also known as the ""fascist salute,"" which Italian fascists and later Nazi Germany adopted. Rolling Stone wrote that white nationalists and neo-Nazis celebrated Musk’s gesture.
Other social media users, though, said the gesture was meant to show Musk symbolically throwing his heart to the crowd, as he said ""my heart goes out to you"" immediately after the gesture.

The image (from the provided URL) shows a protest scene, likely from a demonstration against fascism or Nazism.  Crucially, there are no visible references to Elon Musk, the X platform (formerly Twitter), the MAGA movement, or any direct connection to the claimed statement.

The image's visual elements primarily depict:

* **Protesters:** A crowd of people participating in a protest.  Their attire and banners might suggest an anti-fascist or anti-Nazi stance (this is difficult to definitively say without clearer text on the banners).
* **Protest signs/banners:**  These are partially visible and blurred, preventing any specific textual analysis. However, their general presence suggests a political demonstration, not a discussion related to Elon Musk or the MAGA movement.
* **General protest atmosphere:** The image depicts a dynamic scene characteristic of a rally or protest; there's a sense of movement and collective action.  This is not indicative of a social media post or its aftermath.

The claim, on the other hand, focuses on a specific statement allegedly made by Elon Musk on the X platform, referring to a comparison between the MAGA movement and Nazi Germany. This is entirely separate from the context of the image. There's no visual representation of the X platform, any quotes from Musk, or any symbols representing the MAGA movement or Nazi Germany.

The low similarity score (0.25) reflects the complete lack of visual overlap between the image's content and the claim's subject matter.  The image is a depiction of a political protest, while the claim discusses a specific social media post and its controversial content. The two are independent and unrelated events.  CLIP correctly identifies this lack of semantic connection.

Here's why:

* **Image Content:** The image shows Anthony Fauci, a prominent immunologist and former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.  There is text overlay related to a news report about him.  Neither Joe Biden nor Michael Byrd are present in the image.

* **Claim Content:** The claim involves a pardon granted by Joe Biden to Michael Byrd, a person not shown or mentioned in the image. This connection is completely absent from the visual data.

* **CLIP Limitations:** CLIP, like all large language models, is prone to making spurious connections based on statistical correlations learned during training.  It might have weakly associated ""former president"" from the claim with the prominent figure of Fauci (a public figure often interacting with past and present presidents), or detected some superficial textual similarities in the news report text and the claim itself. However, these are weak and insufficient grounds for a meaningful relationship.  The 0.26 score reflects the low confidence of the model in this connection.

The mountain was called Mount McKinley from 1917 to 2015, when the Obama administration renamed it Denali.
The Obama-era change followed decades of requests from Native Alaskan leaders for the mountain’s native name ‘Denali,’ a Koyukon Athabaskan word meaning ""the tall one,"" ""the high one"" or ""the great one"" to be restored.
In his Jan. 20 order, Trump called the name change to Denali an ""affront to President McKinley’s life, his achievements, and his sacrifice."" The national park where the mountain is found will continue to be called Denali National Park and Preserve, Trump’s order said.
Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, for years has argued to keep the name Denali and criticized Trump’s move.

""I strongly disagree with the President’s decision on Denali,"" Murkowski said in a Jan. 20 X post. ""Our nation’s tallest mountain, which has been called Denali for thousands of years, must continue to be known by the rightful name bestowed by Alaska’s Koyukon Athabascans, who have stewarded the land since time immemorial.""
Is Murkowski right that the mountain has been called Denali for ""thousands of years""? PolitiFact asked four Native Alaskan language and cultural experts and a former cartographer involved in the 2015 name change to weigh in.
""It is not just thousands of years, but over 10,000 years,"" said James Kari, a linguist and an emeritus professor at the Native Alaskan Language Center who has specialized in the Dené or Athabaskan language family for 50 years. Native Alaskan place names have been in use for more than 13,000 years, Kari said.
There is little written evidence of place names related to Native Alaskan tribes because they primarily have an oral tradition. But experts agree the name ""Denali"" has been passed down over several generations.
""We have this overlap of history and archaeology and geology that align with validating the longevity of Dené place names,"" said Taa’ąįį Ch’igiiontà, the Gwich'in language director of the Neetsaii Gwich'in tribe, citing other Native Alaskan place names that have endured for centuries. The Gwich'in language is part of the Athabascan language family. ""So, I think it's quite accurate for Murkowski to say that the name is thousands of years old.""
A 2016 National Park Service article said, ""‘McKinley’ was incompatible with the Athabascan worldview because they rarely name places after people.""
We asked Murkowski’s office for further information but received no reply. Trump’s order said the interior secretary shall reinstate the name Mount McKinley; the Senate has yet to confirm Trump’s interior secretary nominee, former North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.
Disputes over the mountain’s name are not new
In 1975, Alaska’s Legislature passed a resolution requesting the mountain’s name to revert to Denali and Gov. Jay Hammond petitioned the federal government with this request. But the Ohio congressional delegation (where McKinley had been governor) blocked attempts to change the name.

Vandegraft, the Domestic Names Committee’s former chairman and retired cartographer for the Interior Department. 
Despite that, Native Alaskans continued to refer to the mountain as Denali. 
For Indigenous people, the government’s use of native names for places is important after centuries of colonization that sought to erase native culture and identity.
""It feels to some people like a small thing, but for Indigenous people, it's really important because it's a matter of recognizing that we are here, that we were stewards of these lands in many cases for millennia,"" Forest S. Haven, assistant professor of anthropology and Alaska Native Studies at the University of Alaska Southeast, said. ""Returning these place names points to that.

Murkowski said, ""Our nation’s tallest mountain … has been called Denali for thousands of years."" 
Four Native Alaskan scholars and a retired Interior Department official who researched the history of the name agree that Denali was the name of the mountain for thousands of years.

The claim states that Denali has been the mountain's name for thousands of years.  The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.33 reflects a weak but understandable connection.  Here's why:

The connection stems from the *contradiction* between the image and the claim. The image depicts a sign clearly labeling the mountain as ""Mt. McKinley,"" a name that is comparatively recent. This directly contradicts the claim that the mountain has been called ""Denali"" for millennia.  The presence of the ""Mt. McKinley"" sign is a visual representation of a competing name, making the image relevant to the discussion of the mountain's name and its history.

The low similarity score (0.33) is likely due to several factors:

* **Indirect Relationship:** The image doesn't directly show ""Denali.""  The relationship is established through the implicit contrast: the image shows the alternative name, highlighting the debate surrounding the mountain's nomenclature.
* **Lack of Explicit Context:** The image alone doesn't provide the historical context needed to fully understand the claim.  It only presents a single, current-day sign.
* **Visual Ambiguity:**  The smaller text below ""Mt. McKinley"" remains unclear, potentially containing further information that could strengthen or weaken the connection.
* **CLIP's Limitations:** CLIP relies on correlating visual features with textual descriptions. The semantic nuance of historical naming disputes might be challenging for the model to fully grasp.

In summary, the image is considered ""Related"" because it visually presents a name directly relevant to the claim, creating an indirect comparison that highlights the conflicting naming conventions surrounding the mountain. The low similarity score accurately reflects the weak, indirect, and context-dependent nature of this relationship.  The image is relevant to the discussion of the mountain's name, but it doesn't directly support or refute the claim without further context.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement does offer a tip form, but it is also to report child exploitation or other crimes unrelated to unauthorized entry to the U.S. On the tip form, the agency says there is ""no absolute guarantee"" that tip information will result in monetary payments, but the agency has the discretion and authority to pay for information used to support criminal investigations. 
We found neither news releases from Immigration and Customs Enforcement nor credible reports when searching Google and the Nexis news database about such payments being offered. 
Absent evidence that Immigration and Customs Enforcement is offering $750 to turn in people illegally in the U.S., we rate this claim False.",FALSE,image_96.jpg,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/ice_officer_1_23_2024/dcd633cb0b61e8a249bf564b9eab5e62.jpg,Related,0.2909178435802459,"The image shows a photo of an ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) officer in uniform.  The relatively low similarity score of 0.29 suggests a weak relationship between the image and the claim.  While the image is visually relevant to the claim's subject matter (ICE), it provides no evidence to support or refute the claim about a $750 reward for reporting illegal immigrants.

The CLIP model likely classified the image as ""Related"" due to the presence of an ICE officer, a visually prominent element directly connected to the claim's subject. The algorithm associates the visual representation of an ICE officer with the concept of ICE's activities, which are the central theme of the claim.  However, the image lacks any textual or visual elements directly supporting the specific assertion of a $750 reward for tips.  There's no mention of a tip line, reward money, or any related information in the image itself.

The low similarity score reflects this lack of direct evidence.  The connection is purely contextual—the image shows someone associated with the organization mentioned in the claim, but provides no information about the specific policy mentioned in the claim. The relationship is one of weak association rather than direct support or refutation.  The algorithm recognizes the thematic connection but lacks evidence within the image to strongly link the visual data to the specific details of the claim.  Essentially, the image shows *who* might be involved, but not *what* policy is in effect.

The April 1 ballot will include a referendum question asking if the voter ID requirement should be enshrined in the state constitution. 
At a Jan. 8 news conference announcing the referendum, Republicans argued the majority of the public — including in Wisconsin — supports requiring voters to show their ID before getting a ballot.
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said the referendum will allow voters an ""opportunity to give us their final say on something that is supported, if you look at any poll, by 70 to 80% of the public.""
If the referendum fails, Wisconsin’s voter ID law would still remain in place. If passed, it would elevate the law to the state constitution, making it harder for the state Supreme Court to overturn it or future lawmakers to repeal it.
""The left has chosen one of the most extreme liberals to run for the state Supreme Court,"" Vos added, referring to Susan Crawford, who as an attorney represented plaintiffs challenging the voter ID law.

""When 80% of the public in Wisconsin is in favor of an idea, I don’t know who would be afraid of that, except the person who’s with the 20% and is on the ballot,"" he said.
So, Republicans are also saying this level of support exists in Wisconsin, not just nationwide. Let’s look at the most recent polling available. 
Nationwide surveys from 2024 found support even above 80%
When PolitiFact Wisconsin contacted Vos’ office, his chief of staff, Jenny Toftness, pointed us to two polls, including a nationwide one Gallup released in October 2024.
That poll found 84% of the public supports requiring voters to provide photo identification at their polling place, with 15% opposed. 
That support breaks down into 98% of Republicans who favor voter ID, compared to 84% of independents and 67% of Democrats, Gallup found.
The poll randomly sampled more than 1,000 adults living in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, according to its methodology section. 
PolitiFact Wisconsin also looked at a similar poll conducted by the Pew Research Center, which state Rep. Scott Krug, R-Nekoosa, cited at the news conference. That poll was released in February 2024. 
That poll showed 81% support requiring government-issued photo identification to vote, with 18% opposed. That includes 95% of Republicans and 69% of Democrats.
Marquette last polled Wisconsinites on voter ID in 2021, found 74% support
Vos’ office also referenced the Marquette University Law School poll, considered one of the nations highest-quality polls.
Marquette asked the following question across multiple polls in 2012, 2014 and 2021: ""Do you favor or oppose requiring a government-issued photo ID to vote?""
In a poll of Wisconsin registered voters released Aug. 11, 2021, 74% favored voter ID, and 21% opposed it. Five percent didn’t know, and 1% refused to answer.

When broken down by party, support was at 92% among Republicans, 71% among independents and 55% among Democrats.
Interestingly, 74% is a higher measure of support than when the Marquette poll asked the same question multiple times in 2012 and 2014. 
Support hovered around 60% for most of that period, dropping as low as 58% in a October 2014 poll, and reaching as high as 66% in January 2012, the first time the question was asked.
Former Gov. Scott Walker signed the voter ID law in 2011, but it didn’t take effect until the 2016 presidential election cycle because of court challenges.
Although that data is more than 3 years old, Republicans are still referencing the most up-to-date polling in Wisconsin, because Marquette hasn’t asked the question since 2021.
Our ruling
Vos said ""70 to 80% of the public"" in Wisconsin and the country supports requiring photo identification to vote. 
National polling from Pew and Gallup released in 2024 shows more than 80% of the public supports voter ID, including majorities of Democrats.
The Marquette poll last asked about voter ID in 2021 and found support was at 74%, a jump from 2012 and 2014.
Vos at one point said 80% of Wisconsinites support voter ID. That’s rounding up quite a bit, but he said 70% to 80% earlier in the press conference. And 74% is in the middle of that range. 
We rate his claim True.",TRUE,image_97.jpg,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/Voter_ID_sign_on_Super_Tuesday_in_North_Carolina_March_5_2024/c4789b8e3363151ca96733123753df69.jpg,Related,0.2978980541229248,"The image shows a sign at a polling place on Super Tuesday in North Carolina reading ""Voter ID Required.""  The claim states that 70-80% of the public supports voter ID laws.  The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.30 reflects a weak but understandable connection.

Here's a breakdown of why the connection is made, albeit weakly:

* **Semantic Link:** The core concept linking the claim and the image is ""voter ID."" The image directly depicts a sign mandating voter ID, a central element of the claim.  This shared semantic concept drives the connection.

* **Contextual Relevance:** The image's context – a polling place on Super Tuesday – reinforces the relevance to voting and voter identification. This contextual alignment contributes to the ""Related"" classification.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The relatively low similarity score (0.30) indicates a weak connection. This is likely because:
    * **The image doesn't directly support the claim's polling data.** The image shows a *requirement* for voter ID, not public *support* for it.  The claim is about public opinion, while the image is about a policy implementation.  This mismatch weakens the relationship.
    * **The image lacks explicit mention of public opinion.**  The sign simply states a requirement; it doesn't reflect the public's attitude towards the requirement.
    * **Visual Simplicity:** The image is visually simple – a photograph of a sign.  There's limited visual information for CLIP to process beyond the text on the sign.

In summary, CLIP establishes a connection because the image depicts a voter ID requirement, a topic directly related to the claim about public support for voter ID laws. However, the weak similarity score reflects the fundamental difference between the image (showing policy) and the claim (referencing public opinion). The image serves as relevant context but doesn't provide evidence for or against the claim's numerical assertion.

"Joe Biden
stated on January 17, 2025 in a statement:",“The Equal Rights Amendment has become part of our Constitution.”,"stated on January 17, 2025 in a statement:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/jan/22/joe-biden/bidens-false-claim-that-the-equal-rights-amendment/,,"Days before leaving office, former President Joe Biden said that 38 states had ratified the Equal Rights Amendment, an anti-sex-discrimination law Congress passed in 1972 — enough to make it the U.S. Constitution’s 28th Amendment.
Biden said he believes the amendment is in effect after Virginia became the 38th state to ratify it in 2020. Biden said he agreed with opinions by the American Bar Association and ""leading legal constitutional scholars that the Equal Rights Amendment has become part of our Constitution."" The deadline for states to ratify the amendment passed nearly four decades before Virginia ratified it. 
""I affirm what I believe and what three-fourths of the states have ratified: the 28th Amendment is the law of the land, guaranteeing all Americans equal rights and protections under the law regardless of their sex,"" Biden said in a written statement. 
Biden’s claim rests on legal interpretations that a ratification deadline Congress imposed when proposing the amendment is unconstitutional. Proponents of the Equal Rights Amendment have pushed for its recognition on these grounds, but other legal scholars consider the argument flawed.
No court in the country has recognized the amendment’s legitimacy, and the national archivist hasn't published it, despite efforts from activist groups to have the amendment recognized.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
When Congress passed the Equal Rights Amendment, which guaranteed protection against sex-based discrimination, the resolution set a seven-year time limit for three-fourths of the states to ratify the amendment and make it part of the Constitution. In 1979, Congress voted to extend the deadline by three years, to 1982. 
Not enough states ratified the amendment by 1982, but, in the intervening years, more states ratified the amendment despite the time limit on the original proposal. Five states withdrew their ratifications in the 1970s, and North Dakota did so in 2021. The debate over the amendment centers on the ratification deadline’s validity and the states’ withdrawals. 
Biden’s assessment is largely symbolic. His own Office of Legal Counsel in 2022 mostly supported an opinion from President Donald Trump’s first administration that said the amendment died when the 1982 deadline passed without the necessary support from three-fourths of the states. 
During his first term, Trump asked courts to block the amendment’s adoption.
National Archivist Colleen Shogan, a Biden appointee who oversees the National Archives and Records Administration and directs publishing constitutional amendments, said in December that the Equal Rights Amendment cannot be certified ""due to established legal, judicial, and procedural decisions.""
In a Jan. 20 statement to PolitiFact, a National Archives and Records Administration spokesperson said the amendment’s ""underlying legal and procedural issues have not changed.""
Biden did not direct the national archivist to publish the amendment. Biden’s White House press team did not respond to a request for comment. 
Amendment supporters say deadline is unenforceable
Some legal experts say the amendment became part of the Constitution when Virginia ratified it in 2020, arguing the time limit and state rescissions are not constitutionally valid. 
Harvard University law professor Laurence Tribe, who focuses on constitutional law and civil rights, told PolitiFact he was one of the scholars Biden spoke to before issuing his statement. Tribe said the Constitution’s Article V, which lays out the amendment process, doesn’t authorize Congress to set time limits on ratification outside the amendment’s text. 
Congress has periodically set time limits for ratification in the amendment’s text, as it did with the 18th Amendment on prohibition. In other cases, Congress has proposed time limits in resolutions proposing amendments, rather than in the amendment itself.
Tribe also said the states that rescinded their ratification — Nebraska, Tennessee, Idaho, Kentucky, South Dakota and North Dakota — lacked legal grounds to do so, given a dispute over the ratification of the 14th Amendment. After the Civil War, some states tried to rescind their ratification of the 14th Amendment, which guaranteed equal protection under the law for formerly enslaved people. Congress denied those efforts and declared the amendment enacted after enough states had ratified it.
A federal court in Idaho ruled in 1982 that states could rescind their ratifications for the Equal Rights Amendment. The Supreme Court did not decide on the question because it dismissed the case after the ratification deadline had passed. 
The American Bar Association approved a resolution in August aligning with Biden’s opinion and arguing that the limitations on the ratification process are invalid.
Opponents say Congress can set time limits
Courts have generally not backed Biden’s view of the amendment’s validity.

Michael Jordan said that “any athlete who kneels for our national anthem should lose their medal.”
By Claire Cranford • February 19, 2025
The U.S. Supreme Court has not ruled on the question directly, but a lower court judge said in 2021 that the existing precedent supports the argument that the time limit is legally enforceable.
The Supreme Court declined to hear the 1982 case that sought to prevent some states from rescinding their ratification of the amendment, declaring the issue moot after the ratification deadline had passed. The court’s decision to dismiss the case meant it believed the deadline had legal force, experts have argued.  
States and activists brought separate court cases around the time Virginia ratified the amendment, hoping to compel the then-National Archivist David Ferriero to certify the amendment as ratified. Both were denied because the groups lacked standing.
Accounting for the Supreme Court’s refusal to consider a case after the deadline had passed, along with other legal history, District Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled that the amendment’s deadline was valid in a 2021 opinion.
""It makes no difference if a ratification deadline is in the prefatory text of a resolution proposing an amendment or in the amendment itself — either way, the deadline is valid,"" he wrote. 
Stephen Sachs, a constitutional law professor and jurisprudence expert, said the amending resolution’s text has equal force as the amendment itself. 
""The resolution is the amendment: it’s agreed on by two-thirds of each House, and it specifies the precise changes to the Constitution that Congress wants to make,"" Sachs said. Even though Article V doesn’t expressly say Congress can impose deadlines, Sachs said it has the power to ""propose Amendments,"" which includes proposals that come with conditions.  
Given the judicial history on the issue, Sachs said Biden’s claim about the Equal Rights Amendment was ""wildly overconfident and irresponsible."" 
Our ruling
Biden said, ""The Equal Rights Amendment has become part of our Constitution."" 
The National Archives lists only 27 amendments to the Constitution. Courts have routinely dismissed the argument that it was properly ratified. 
Some legal scholars argue that the amendment was properly ratified, but for Biden to definitively say it’s ""the law of the land"" ignores precedent and the reality that no federal government entity has recognized the amendment as part of the Constitution. 
We rate Biden’s claim False.",FALSE,image_98.jpg,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/era_rally/694595f4171f786a3a094e8a1b8df936.jpg,Related,0.3061428070068359,"The image shows a photograph from an Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) rally.  The relatively low CLIP similarity score of 0.31, while classified as ""Related,"" indicates a weak connection between the image and the claim ""The Equal Rights Amendment has become part of our Constitution.""  This is because the image depicts *advocacy* for the ERA, not its *ratification* and inclusion in the Constitution.

Here's a breakdown of why the connection is weak, despite the image's relevance:

* **Visual Elements:** The image shows a crowd of people at a rally, likely protesting or advocating for the ERA's passage.  There are signs visible, although the text is mostly illegible. The overall visual suggests a period of *activism* surrounding the ERA, signifying the ongoing struggle for its ratification rather than its successful incorporation into the Constitution.  The energy and focus are on the *effort* to achieve the amendment's passage, not its actual inclusion.

* **Lack of Definitive Proof:** The image provides no concrete evidence that the ERA has become part of the Constitution.  It doesn't show a legal document, a congressional vote, or any official announcement of ratification.  It only displays the passionate support for an amendment that, at the time of the photo, had not yet been ratified.

* **Contextual Understanding:** CLIP likely recognizes keywords associated with the ERA (through signs or implied context) and connects it to the claim. However, it doesn't possess the deeper understanding of US constitutional law and the ERA's historical context to fully appreciate the crucial difference between advocacy and legal reality.  The image reflects the *desire* for the ERA's inclusion, not the *fact* of its inclusion.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The low similarity score (0.31) explicitly reflects the weak connection. It suggests that while there is a thematic link between the image (ERA advocacy) and the claim (ERA's inclusion in the Constitution), the visual evidence directly supporting the claim is minimal to nonexistent.  The image shows the *process*, not the outcome stated in the claim.

In summary, the image is related to the claim in the sense that it depicts a historical moment concerning the ERA, but the connection is weak because it shows the fight *for* the amendment, not the amendment's actual successful ratification and inclusion in the Constitution.  The low similarity score reflects this lack of direct visual evidence supporting the claim.

The classification of ""Related"" with a similarity score of 0.31, while not a high score, indicates a degree of visual relevance to the claim that the address was prerecorded and handlers were queuing it up.  Let's break down why CLIP might have made this association:

* **The presence of a video player interface:** The image clearly shows a video player interface, typical of livestreams or video-on-demand platforms. This is key.  The claim suggests manipulation of the playback, implying a prerecorded video being played.  The presence of this interface lends credibility to the possibility of such manipulation, even if it doesn't prove it.

* **The paused or buffering state (possible interpretation):** While not entirely clear from the image alone, the screen might appear to be paused or buffering. This visual cue could be interpreted by CLIP as a moment of technical interruption, hinting at the idea of someone manually managing the playback, aligning with the ""handlers queuing it up"" part of the claim.  The slight blurriness could contribute to this ambiguous interpretation.

* **Absence of live-indicative elements:** The absence of prominent live indicators (e.g., a clearly visible live counter, a chat feed, or other real-time interactive elements commonly found on live streams) might have subtly influenced CLIP's assessment. The lack of these expected features might have contributed to the algorithm's perception of a less typical, possibly pre-recorded, event.

* **Low similarity score:** The low similarity score of 0.31 is crucial.  It highlights that the image alone offers limited direct evidence supporting the claim. CLIP doesn't ""see"" handlers, nor does it directly interpret the video's playback state conclusively. The relationship is inferential, based on the context of the claim and the visual elements present.  A higher score would indicate a stronger visual match.

In summary, CLIP's ""Related"" classification isn't based on direct visual proof of pre-recording or handlers. Instead, it's a weak association based on the indirect visual cues within the image: the presence of a video player interface, a possible (but uncertain) paused/buffering state, and the absence of typical live stream indicators. The low similarity score emphasizes the weakness of this visual evidence alone in supporting the claim. Further investigation and evidence beyond the image would be required to verify the claim.

""So we are abundantly clear it has nothing to do with climate change or Donald Trump,"" Trump Jr. wrote in a Jan. 14 Instagram post, which included a clip from the business and tech podcast ""All-In.""
PolitiFact asked Trump Jr., President Donald Trump’s eldest child, for evidence behind his claim. We reached out through his website and contacted the Trump Organization, for which Trump Jr. is executive vice president. We received no reply. 
Climate scientists PolitiFact spoke to disagreed with Trump Jr. and said climate change contributed to the Los Angeles fires’ size and destructiveness. Numerous studies have linked human-caused climate change to the western U.S.’ worsening wildfires.
In a Jan. 13 analysis, scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles attributed about 25% of the brush dryness around Los Angeles to human-caused climate change. Increased heat over the summer and fall dried out the brush that fueled the fire, the report said.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
The fires would likely have been destructive even without climate change’s influence, the report said, but would have been ""somewhat smaller and less intense.""
Fully understanding what contributed to the fires — and how much climate change worsened them — will take more research, the report said. Nevertheless, the report identified factors in which ""human-induced climate change is very likely to play a role in the wildfires.""
Climate change has contributed to more intense wildfires in the western U.S. in recent decades, primarily through higher temperatures, which suck more moisture out of vegetation and make it easier to burn, said University of California, Los Angeles climate scientist Chad Thackeray, who contributed to the new report. Fires have not become more frequent, Thackeray said, but they have become larger and burned more acres.
A 2021 study the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration commissioned found that 68% to 88% of the increase in vapor pressure deficit (a measure of the air’s dryness) from 1979 to 2020 linked to human-caused warming, rather than natural atmospheric changes.
A 2016 study, funded partly by Columbia University and NASA, found human-caused climate change ""has emerged as a driver of increased forest fire activity and should continue to do so while fuels are not limiting.""
High temperatures over the past summer and fall dried out the brush surrounding Los Angeles and were the main contribution climate change made to the current fires, Thackeray said. 
""This occurs because a warmer atmosphere is ‘thirstier’ meaning it has a greater demand to evaporate water from vegetation/soil,"" he said. 
Average temperatures in California — and around the globe — have increased steadily since 1900, an effect linked to carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. 
""While dry weather is not unprecedented in the US West, 2024 was exceptionally dry in Southern California and through model experiments and statistical analysis, it’s demonstrable that part of that dryness can be attributed to climate change,"" University of California, Davis climate modeling professor Paul Ullrich said in an email.

By Ciara O'Rourke • January 27, 2025
Some of the growth in wildfires in recent decades can also be attributed to forest management practices, he said, but climate change plays a major role.
Another possible climate change-related contributor to the fire is heavy rainfall during previous rainy seasons. The rain spurred vegetation growth, and the vegetation dried out during dry months, giving the fire more fuel. UCLA’s study estimated climate change may have contributed around 10% of the excess rainfall from 2023 to 2024. 
In contrast to previous wet years, Southern California received virtually no rain during the current wet season, which began in October. Although models predict that climate change will delay the rainy season’s onset, Thackeray said research continues and there isn’t enough evidence to attribute the lack of rain in the last few months to climate change. 
""The observed decline may be simply a regression to the mean after an extended period of unusually wet falls in the mid-1900s,"" the UCLA report said.
The strong Santa Ana winds that worsened the fires in their initial days were stronger than usual for this time of year, but not unprecedented and not attributable to climate change, the report said.
During his Jan. 15 Senate confirmation hearing, Chris Wright, President Trump’s nominee to lead the Energy Department, faced questions about his 2023 description of climate-related wildfire warnings as ""hype to justify more impoverishment from bad government policies."" Wright said he stood by his comment, but he acknowledged the scientific consensus on climate change.
Our ruling
Trump Jr. said the Los Angeles wildfires have ""nothing to do with climate change."" 
There is ample evidence that higher temperatures have made California wildfires bigger and more destructive in recent decades. For these fires in particular, a preliminary report found that high temperatures, worsened by climate change, made the vegetation in Southern California dryer, contributing to the fires.

* **Visual Context:** The image directly depicts a California wildfire, a key element of the claim.  The presence of firefighters fighting the blaze strongly implies a significant wildfire event. This visual correlation is the primary reason for the model's positive, albeit weak, relationship score.

* **Absence of Explicit Denial:** The image contains no text or symbols directly contradicting the claim.  It simply shows the effects of wildfires, which are discussed in the context of the claim.  The lack of explicit counter-evidence allows for a weak association.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The low similarity score (0.32) reflects the inherent ambiguity. The image doesn't directly prove or disprove the claim. The claim is a strong statement about causation, while the image only shows a *consequence* (the wildfire).  The model acknowledges a tenuous link because the wildfire is relevant to the discussion but lacks direct evidence supporting or refuting the causation argument.

* **CLIP's limitations:** CLIP excels at associating images with text based on visual elements and commonly associated concepts. However, it doesn't possess the nuanced understanding of complex scientific relationships like climate change's role in wildfires. It's likely associating the image with the claim based solely on the shared presence of ""California wildfires"" in both, overlooking the crucial difference between a visual depiction and a causal explanation.

In summary, the CLIP model's ""Related"" classification is a result of the image's depiction of a California wildfire, a topic directly addressed in the claim. The low similarity score, however, reflects the model's inability to discern the crucial difference between simply showing a wildfire and definitively proving or disproving the claim about its causal relationship with climate change.  The model lacks the scientific understanding to judge the validity of the statement; it only identifies a shared topical element.

Other Threads users made similar claims. These posts were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)
But these posts misconstrue the scope of Trump’s executive order on birthright citizenship, which already faces legal challenges.
Birthright citizenship refers to people’s right to become U.S citizens if they’re born in the U.S., regardless of their parents’ immigration status.

Trump’s executive order says the privilege of U.S. citizenship ""does not automatically extend"" to children born in the U.S. when the mother was ""unlawfully present in the United States and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person's birth"" or when the ""mother’s presence in the United States at the time of said person’s birth was lawful but temporary.""
It lists temporary statuses such as visiting the country on a visa waiver program or visiting on a student, work or tourist visa.
The order says it will apply in 30 days to children born under those circumstances.
Usha Vance was born in the U.S. after her parents immigrated from India in the late 1970s. Her father, Krish Chilukuri, is an engineering lecturer at San Diego State University. Her mother, Lakshmi Chilukuri, is a molecular biology teaching professor and provost of Sixth College at University of California, San Diego. 
We don’t know what their immigration statuses were when Usha was born in 1986, but Trump’s executive order won’t revoke Vance’s citizenship status. That’s because the order applies to future children born in the U.S. to parents in the country illegally. It doesn’t say that this directive will be applied retroactively.
The order says, ""Nothing in this order shall be construed to affect the entitlement of other individuals, including children of lawful permanent residents, to obtain documentation of their United States citizenship.""
Trump’s directive says agencies cannot issue documents recognizing citizenship or accept any governmental documents purporting to recognize citizenship for births in those cases. He told department leaders to issue public guidance within 30 days for the order's application.
The order faces legal challenges. On Jan. 20, immigrant and civil rights groups filed the first lawsuits against the order, just hours after Trump signed it.

By Sara Swann • January 22, 2025
As Trump campaigned on this promise in 2024, legal experts told PolitiFact that attempts to end birthright citizenship would prompt a court battle over the long-standing interpretation of the 14th Amendment and could require a constitutional amendment.
The 14th Amendment says that ""all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.""
PolitiFact contacted the Trump-Vance team, but received no response before publication.
Our ruling
A Threads post claimed Vance ""will have her citizenship revoked if Trump signs his executive order banning birthright citizenship.""
Trump’s executive order seeks to end birthright citizenship for future children born in the U.S. to parents who are in the country illegally. It is to take effect next month, unless legal challenges block it.
The order would not affect Vance’s U.S. citizenship status because it does not say it will be applied retroactively to people already born in the U.S. to immigrant parents.

The image shows Donald Trump, alongside what appears to be Usha Vance and another individual (presumably her husband, JD Vance).  They are sitting outside a church.  The image conveys nothing about the legal status of Usha Vance, the existence or content of any executive order regarding birthright citizenship, nor any imminent action to revoke her citizenship.

Here's a breakdown of why the low similarity score is appropriate:

* **Lack of textual information:** The image contains no text relevant to the claim. There are no news headlines, captions, or any other written elements mentioning citizenship, executive orders, or legal proceedings.

* **Absence of contextual clues:** The setting (outside a church) and the individuals present (Trump and the Vances) provide no direct or indirect indication of the claim's veracity.  The friendly demeanor in the photograph suggests a social or political gathering, not a legal proceeding or announcement concerning citizenship.

* **Visual ambiguity:** While we can identify the individuals, the image offers no visual evidence supporting or refuting the claim.  There are no documents, official seals, or any other visual cues that would link the image to the specific legal action mentioned.

* **Low-level features:** CLIP's analysis likely considers low-level features like color, texture, and object composition.  These features in the image (people sitting outside, a building) have very little in common with the abstract concepts inherent in the claim (legal action, citizenship revocation, executive orders).

In essence, the image is a neutral photograph of a public appearance. It provides no information relevant to the claim's core assertion regarding Usha Vance's citizenship. The low similarity score accurately reflects this lack of connection.  The image simply depicts a scene; the claim asserts a specific legal event.  The two are unrelated.

Krystyna Sikora una asistente de investigación en la Alianza para Asegurar la Democracia del German Marshall Fund, nos dijo que estas son algunas de las cosas que delatan a las imágenes como creadas usando IA:
Las imágenes están demasiado estilizadas y tienen un aspecto retocado. Parecen demasiado perfectas o tienen una calidad cinematográfica. 
En la foto del ciervo, un ciervo al fondo parece tener tres orejas. La oreja del otro ciervo en la misma foto sobresale demasiado recta para ser real.
En la imagen del lobo, el animal del fondo aparentemente no tiene extremidades. En la misma imagen también hay un trozo de hierba que parece fuera de lugar y tiene texturas y colores inusualmente similares al pelaje del lobo. 
En la foto del incendio, los coches en el aparcamiento están muy borrosos y casi parece como si algunos de ellos estuvieran uno encima del otro. 
Debido a la forma en que se entrenan los modelos de IA, si se les indica, a veces pueden producir artefactos o dispositivos completamente fabricados. En una de las imágenes, el animal parece ser un híbrido de jabalí y lobo, con hocico de jabalí y cuerpo y orejas de lobo, que no existen juntos en un animal real.

The claim ""Imágenes muestran animales heridos en los incendios de Los Ángeles"" translates to ""Images show injured animals in the Los Angeles fires.""  The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.30 reflects a weak positive correlation between the image and the claim, and this is understandable given the following:

* **Absence of Injured Animals:** The most crucial reason for the low similarity score is the *lack* of any visible injured animals in the image.  The picture depicts a charred and smoky environment, consistent with a wildfire aftermath, but it does not show any animals, let alone injured ones.  This directly contradicts the core assertion of the claim.

* **Contextual Relevance:** The image's relevance stems solely from its depiction of a burned landscape, which is *contextually* related to the claim. The claim mentions Los Angeles fires, and the image plausibly shows the aftermath of such a fire.  This contextual connection, however weak, contributes to the model's ""Related"" classification.

* **Low Similarity Score (0.30):** The low similarity score (0.30) explicitly indicates that the relationship is weak.  CLIP doesn't see a strong visual match between the image content and the claim's assertion of injured animals. The score reflects the lack of direct visual evidence supporting the claim.  The model is more likely associating the image with the *general topic* of wildfires than with the specific claim about injured animals.

* **Limitations of CLIP:**  CLIP relies on visual and textual features.  It cannot infer the presence of injured animals based on the charred landscape alone.  It lacks the reasoning capability to connect the context of wildfires with the potential for animal injury.  The classification is purely based on visual similarity and textual semantic overlap, without deeper contextual understanding.


In summary, the ""Related"" classification is based on a very loose contextual link – both the image and the claim pertain to the Los Angeles fires. However, the absence of any visual evidence of injured animals leads to a low similarity score, accurately reflecting the weak connection between the image and the specific assertion made in the claim.  The model's classification highlights the limitations of relying solely on visual similarity and contextual clues without deeper semantic understanding.

Several people have expressed interest in buying TikTok, including billionaire businessman Frank McCourt, former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson, also known as MrBeast.
Some people have also floated billionaire Elon Musk, who owns the social media platform X, as another potential buyer, although Musk has not publicly announced intentions of buying TikTok. Musk has been a vocal Trump supporter, and Trump tapped Musk to co-lead with Vivek Ramaswamy the Department of Government Efficiency, an advisory group charged with cutting government spending.
Still, we wondered about what would happen if Trump did make such an announcement about buying TikTok.

By Ciara O'Rourke • January 28, 2025
Legal and government ethics experts told PolitiFact that if Trump had decided to personally buy TikTok, it likely would not have violated federal law. That’s because the president is exempt from federal conflict of interest laws that require other government officials to divest from financial interests.
""The idea at the time, some 50 years ago, was that the president does so many things that any asset could be considered a conflict,"" said Jordan Libowitz, vice president of communications at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a government ethics watchdog nonprofit.
Although not required to do so, presidents have typically divested from financial interests or put them into a blind trust before assuming office, said Jessica Tillipman, associate dean for government procurement law studies at George Washington University.
But Trump broke that status quo. During his first term, Trump raised government ethics concerns because he didn’t divest from his hotels and golf clubs. Since then, his business ventures have grown to include the social media platform Truth Social, cryptocurrency and new real estate projects abroad — presenting more opportunities for conflicts of interest.
""We’re used to presidents going out of their way to separate themselves from their assets so that the American people never doubted whose interest they were acting in, but that was always done because it was the right thing to do, not because it was legally required,"" Libowitz said.
On Jan. 17, the Supreme Court upheld the federal law requiring TikTok’s Chinese parent company ByteDance to sell the social media app or face a ban of the app in the U.S. starting Jan. 19, one day before Trump’s inauguration.
Nonetheless, this image showing Trump announcing on X that he will be ""purchasing TikTok"" is fabricated.

The relationship between this image and the claim ""President-elect Donald Trump posted on X that he is ‘purchasing TikTok’"" is tenuous, explaining the low similarity score (0.28) from CLIP.

The image provides purely visual evidence of TikTok's presence, showing its branding in the real world. It doesn't depict Trump, X (formerly Twitter), any purchase agreement, or any action related to a potential acquisition.  The image is simply a picture of a TikTok sign – a completely separate and unrelated event to a hypothetical Trump tweet.

CLIP likely assigns a *low* relatedness score because:

* **Indirect connection:** The image is tangentially related to the claim. The claim involves Trump, a purchase, and TikTok. The image only shows TikTok's existence, offering no information about Trump, a purchase transaction, or any actions relating to a potential acquisition.  The connection is purely semantic: the image contains an element mentioned in the claim (TikTok).

* **Lack of contextual information:** The image lacks any contextual information connecting it to Trump's alleged tweet or any acquisition attempt.  There's no indication of a purchase, a press conference, or any other related event.  It's simply a picture of a building with a TikTok logo.

* **Visual vs. textual disparity:** The claim is text-based (Trump's alleged statement). The image is purely visual, and the visual information doesn't directly support or refute the claim's textual content.  CLIP struggles to bridge the gap between the two modalities effectively, leading to a low similarity score.


In short, the image's relevance is purely based on the presence of the TikTok logo.  Everything else related to the claim—Trump, the purchase, the X platform—is absent.  This lack of direct visual correspondence explains the low similarity score. The visual element is a weak, indirect connection to the textual claim.

"Dana Loesch
stated on January 6, 2025 in an X post:",Buncombe County “is still demanding property taxes on homes destroyed by Hurricane Helene based on pre-Helene assessments that no longer apply.”,"stated on January 6, 2025 in an X post:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/jan/17/dana-loesch/are-north-carolinas-helene-victims-still-required/,,"Some social media users are angry that North Carolina property owners must still pay full taxes on properties that were damaged after Hurricane Helene.
The September storm was the deadliest and most damaging in state history. It brought 30 inches of rain, caused more than 1,400 landslides, and damaged about 74,000 homes in western North Carolina — where only about 5% of victims have flood insurance, according to an estimate by the state’s budget director.
In a Jan. 6 X post, Buncombe County reminded residents to pay their 2024 property taxes before they become delinquent — prompting outrage from some users of the platform.
""This county is still demanding property taxes on homes destroyed by Hurricane Helene based on pre-Helene assessments that no longer apply,"" Dana Loesch, a conservative radio show host, told her 1 million X followers in a post.
Other X users posted similar responses, suggesting that Buncombe should waive or reduce property taxes for people affected by Helene.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
A viewer emailed WRAL-TV, PolitiFact’s North Carolina partner, asking if it’s true that Buncombe County and other counties in North Carolina are collecting taxes on Helene-damaged properties. 
The county is indeed collecting taxes. But Loesch’s focus on Buncombe makes it seem as though the county is doing something out of line. In fact, Buncombe — and other North Carolina counties that are collecting taxes — are acting in accordance with state law. Although receiving a hefty tax bill may feel like a bitter pill following the disaster of losing one’s property, the reality of the state’s taxation system gives counties little flexibility. 
Properties are taxed based on what their assessed values were as of Jan. 1 of that year. Buncombe County properties were last assessed in 2021 and those values are still in place. That means the damages from Helene aren’t reflected in the most recent tax bills. And they won’t be reflected until updated assessments are applied. 
Loesch and others on social media implied that Buncombe County should waive or change a property owners’ bill for 2024. State law prevents counties from doing that, so Buncombe officials can’t give Helene victims a break on their 2024 property tax bill — even if they wanted to. There’s an appeals process, but the deadline for that ended before Helene hit. 
Buncombe County officials are encouraging property owners to tell the county about damage to their properties, so that it can be reflected in the next assessment. 
What property owners are being taxed on
  Loesch wrote that properties are being taxed on assessments that ""no longer apply."" The property’s value as of Jan. 1 still applies to a property owner’s 2024 tax bill — even if it doesn’t reflect the current market value, or what someone might be willing to pay by the end of the year.
Loesch didn’t respond to our questions about her statement.
Here’s how the taxing process works:
Counties assess the values of the properties within their borders. The assessments take into account recent comparable sales and other market factors into consideration.
Property taxes are based on the assessed property value that is in place on Jan. 1 of that year, as well as the county’s tax rate.
Most tax bills don’t go out until late summer, after the county’s property tax rate is set, and property owners have about three months to pay their tax bills.
The bills are considered delinquent and can accrue interest if not paid before Jan. 6 (which is why Buncombe posted reminders on social media that day).
Because properties are taxed based on their assessed value as of Jan. 1, damage from Helene doesn’t factor into the 2024 tax bill.
Dia Harris, a North Carolina Department of Revenue spokesperson, told PolitiFact that the agency regularly fields questions from property owners about how disasters might affect their tax bill.
""A property owner whose residence is lost to fire during the calendar year will still be responsible for payment of taxes that are due on the property for that year,"" Harris said. ""And the bill must be based on the full value of the property’s condition as of Jan. 1 of that year.""
Why are taxes based on a property’s value as of Jan. 1, as opposed to another date?
The Jan. 1 date is set by state law and provides county governments with some insight into the size of their tax base, which is helpful for county leaders as they set the next fiscal year spending plan, said Chris McLaughlin, a professor of public law and government at UNC-Chapel Hill who posted about the issue in a Oct. 11 blog entry. If values go down after an assessment, for instance, county leaders might consider raising the tax rate to make up for lost revenue. 
State legislators ""chose Jan. 1 presumably because it is well in advance of the start of the fiscal year (July 1) for which taxes will be levied,"" McLaughlin told PolitiFact in an email. ""This provides the local government with some certainty about the size of its tax base (although there will be minor changes due to appeals) so it can accurately budget and decide upon a property tax rate before the fiscal year begins.""

By Will Doran • October 19, 2016
Counties can’t offer property tax exemptions
  Some social media posts suggested that Buncombe County should waive or postpone property tax bills. However, state law prohibits counties from doing that. The law reads:
""The governing body of a taxing unit is prohibited from releasing, refunding, or compromising all or any portion of the taxes levied against any property within its jurisdiction except as expressly provided in this subchapter."" 
Unless state legislators change the law, ""local governments may not waive property taxes as a response to a natural disaster,"" McLaughlin said. If Helene victims want immediate property tax relief, he said ""they should talk to their local representatives and tell them to pass a bill.""
In the meantime, Buncombe is offering assistance in other ways. The county offers payment plans to property owners who want to avoid paying their tax bill in one lump sum. The county also offers financial assistance to low-income households in areas where increasing property value outpaces income.
In advance of the 2025 tax bill, Buncombe officials are asking residents to inform them of any damage sustained to their properties. The county’s website features a banner: ""Please report damage to your home or property caused by Hurricane Helene."" Clicking the banner opens a form that Buncombe residents can fill out online and submit to the county.
""Property that is damaged as of Jan. 1, 2025, will see a reduction in 2025’s taxable value,"" said Kassi Day, a Buncombe County spokesperson. ""Our assessment team has been working hard to survey damaged areas so values can be updated to reflect the current situation.""
Buncombe officials are also taking action that could limit the effect of property taxes in 2025.
The county was scheduled to conduct a revaluation in 2025 — taking into account how market values have risen over the last four years. Buncombe’s Board of Commissioners recently voted to delay the county’s reappraisal of properties, allowing the 2025 values to remain based on 2021 market assessments.
Our ruling
Loesch said Buncombe County ""is still demanding property taxes on homes destroyed by Hurricane Helene based on pre-Helene assessments that no longer apply.""
Buncombe and other counties are collecting taxes on properties even if they were damaged by Helene. But it’s inaccurate to suggest that the damage from Helene is relevant to the 2024 tax bill, which in North Carolina is based on a property’s assessed value as of Jan. 1, 2024 — months before Helene made landfall. 
Properties that lost value because of damage from Helene could see that reflected on their tax bill due in 2025, Buncombe officials said. Loesch and others on social media implied that Buncombe County should waive or change a property owners’ bill for 2024. Generally speaking, state law prevents counties from doing that.
Loesch’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details that might influence someone’s understanding of the situation. We rate it Half True.",,image_104.jpg,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/asheville1007/44be331a7ac0f1afd698a9c488f889c1.jpeg,Related,0.2718063592910766,"The image shows a partially destroyed house, clearly damaged by a significant weather event.  The damage is extensive enough to suggest uninhabitability and a substantial decrease in property value.  The relationship between the image and the claim is weak, explaining the low similarity score of 0.27 from CLIP.

Here's a breakdown:

* **The Claim:** The claim focuses on a *policy* issue: Buncombe County's continued taxation of destroyed homes based on outdated assessments.  It's about bureaucratic processes and fairness.

* **The Image:** The image depicts the *physical consequence* of a hurricane – a damaged house. It visually represents the destruction but doesn't provide any information about the county's tax assessment policies.  While it shows the *effect* described in the claim (destroyed homes), it doesn't show the *cause* (continued taxation based on pre-hurricane assessments).

CLIP's ""Related"" classification with a low score is likely due to the following:

* **Visual Overlap:** The image contains a visually damaged house, which is tangentially related to the claim. The claim mentions homes destroyed by Hurricane Helene, and the image shows a house that appears to be destroyed by a similar event. This shared semantic element provides a basis for the ""Related"" classification, albeit weak.

* **Lack of Direct Evidence:** The image offers no proof of the claim.  There's no mention of Buncombe County, Hurricane Helene, or any tax-related information within the image.  It only shows the physical damage, which is a necessary but insufficient condition for the claim to be true.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The low score (0.27) reflects the limited connection.  CLIP identifies a superficial link between a damaged house and a claim about property taxes on destroyed houses, but the lack of concrete evidence connecting the image to the specific context of Buncombe County and Hurricane Helene keeps the similarity score low.  The model doesn't ""understand"" the nuanced relationship between the visual and the claim's policy implications.

In summary, the image provides a visual representation of a potential scenario relevant to the claim, but it lacks the specificity required to strongly support or refute it.  The low similarity score accurately reflects this weak connection.  The image is suggestive, but not evidence.

""Some of these reservoirs have been dry for 15, 20 years,"" Vance said on Fox News Sunday as he spoke about Gov. Gavin Newsom. ""The fire hydrants are being reported as going dry while the firefighters are trying to put out these fires. There is a serious lack of competent governance in California, and I think it’s part of the reason why these fires have gotten so bad.""
During the height of fighting the Palisades fire on Jan. 7 and Jan. 8, water demand outpaced the amount of water flowing to hydrants, and some hydrants went dry. A nearby city reservoir was empty for repairs when the fire broke out, the Los Angeles Times reported Jan. 10. 
But Vance’s description of decades-long dry reservoirs is misleading. Experts on California’s water management told us they were not aware of any major reservoir that has been dry for 15 years or more. The state-managed reservoirs in Southern California are, in general, at or above their historic average storage for January. 
The Santa Ynez reservoir that supplies drinking water to Los Angeles’ local system has been empty since February 2024 because it needed repairs. The reservoir can hold up to 117 million gallons. But it’s managed by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, not the state, and it’s used primarily for drinking water.

Had the reservoir been full, it may have supplied more water pressure to the Pacific Palisades during the height of the firefighting and slowed the rate at which hydrants ran dry, said Steve Margulis, the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering chair at the University of California, Los Angeles.
But that reservoir hasn’t been closed for 15 years, so it’s unclear which reservoirs Vance was referring to.
California has close to 1,500 surface reservoirs, a 2018 Public Policy Institute of California Water Policy Center report said. Most are small and managed by local governments, said Jay Lund, the vice director of the Center for Watershed Sciences and a civil and environmental engineering professor at the University of California, Davis. 
Some reservoirs are intentionally left at low levels or empty, Lund said, because they’re used for flood control. But those reservoirs fill during heavy rainfall to prevent flooding. 
It’s possible that a local reservoir somewhere in the state has been shut down for several years, but we did not find an example, and President-elect Donald Trump and Vance’s transition team did not provide examples when PolitiFact reached out for comment. 
""I am sure there are very small reservoirs that have been empty for some time, for one reason or another,"" said Thomas Harter, a hydrology professor at the University of California, Davis. ""No major reservoirs have been empty for that long.""
Small reservoirs that serve local areas outside of Los Angeles have no relation to the city’s water system.
Los Angeles’ water comes from local aqueducts, groundwater and water purchased from Southern California’s Metropolitan Water District. The water district’s water is supplied by the Colorado River, groundwater and the State Water Project that moves water from the north to the dryer southern end.
State Water Project Deputy Director John Yarbrough said in a statement to PolitiFact that there are ""no dry reservoirs in the State Water Project system."" Most of the major reservoirs tracked by the California Department of Water Resources are at or above their historic average storage. 
In a Jan. 12 interview with NBC News, Newsom rebutted Trump’s criticisms of Northern California water management and described Southern California’s reservoirs as ""completely full."" Although the nearby state reservoirs aren’t completely full, they’re close. The state-managed reservoirs in Southern California have stores above 75% of their total capacity.
Newsom’s critics accused the governor of misleading by not mentioning the local empty Santa Ynez reservoir. After the interviewer noted the empty local reservoir, Newsom said, correctly, that the reservoir is not related to the state and federal water management system that Trump criticized early in the wildfire response.

“An ICE minivan was reportedly set on fire in Philadelphia.”
By Sofia Ahmed • February 19, 2025
Newsom on Jan. 10 called for an investigation into why the Santa Ynez reservoir was empty when the Palisades fire broke out. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power said in a Jan. 11 press release it will conduct an investigation into water resiliency and how to better respond to climate-related disasters. 
Regardless of the amount of water in the pipes, though, hydrants and local water infrastructure are built for routine structure fires, not large wildfires that consume entire neighborhoods. The water may have slowed the fire in some places, but experts said it likely would not have dramatically contained the fire. 
Margulis told us it’s unclear how much that extra water would have helped, and the reservoir’s absence should be part of a post-fire investigation. 
""Any additional reservoir would have helped maintain supply and pressure in the area that draws water from it for a longer period of time, but to what extent remains to be determined,"" he said. ""However, given the conditions, once the fire was ignited and started to spread quickly, it is unlikely that the extra supply would have made a major difference in containing it.""
The Department of Water and Power in February 2024 shut down the Santa Ynez reservoir because of damage to its cover. The reservoir supplies drinking water to the city, so it’s subject to environmental regulations to prevent contamination. 
The department said the repairs are ""subject to the city charter’s competitive bidding process which requires time."" The Los Angeles Times reported a $130,000 contract was issued to a Lakeside firm to repair the cover.
Upcoming investigations may determine that local government or management shortcomings contributed to a delay in repairing the reservoir. But the reservoir was shut down for less than a year, not 15 years or more. And it’s not indicative of a statewide problem with reservoirs.
Our ruling
Vance said that some reservoirs in California ""have been dry for 15, 20 years."" 
Experts said that statewide, there are no major reservoirs that have been dry for more than 15 years, and most of California’s reservoirs are above their historic average storage.

One reservoir that supplies water to the Pacific Palisades area has been shut down for nearly a year, and that may have eased the water pressure shortage during the height of the firefighting. 
But Vance’s statement is exaggerated. It contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts. That’s our definition for Mostly False.",FALSE,image_105.jpg,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/AP25017670057232/3d62e339c79ca2f7b681c100231593fe.jpg,Related,0.2669855952262878,"The image shows a mostly dry lakebed, cracked earth, and a small amount of remaining water in the distance.  The claim, ""Some of these (California) reservoirs have been dry for 15, 20 years,"" refers to the prolonged drought conditions in California's reservoirs.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.27 suggests a weak but detectable relationship between the image and the claim.  This relatively low score reflects the lack of direct evidence in the image to definitively support the claim. The image depicts a dry lakebed, which *could* be a reservoir that has been dry for an extended period, aligning with the claim. However, the image doesn't provide any information about the specific location, the duration of the dryness, or whether it's a reservoir at all.  It's simply a visual representation of drought conditions.

The reasons for the weak relationship and low similarity score are:

* **Lack of specificity:** The image doesn't identify the location as a California reservoir. It could be a dry lake, a dried-up riverbed, or a reservoir in another state experiencing drought.
* **No temporal information:** The image doesn't indicate how long the lakebed has been dry.  The visual clues suggest a prolonged dry period, but not necessarily 15-20 years.
* **Visual ambiguity:**  While the cracked earth strongly suggests drought, it doesn't confirm the claim's specific timeframe.  Other factors besides prolonged drought could cause a lakebed to dry up.

In summary, the CLIP model likely classified the image as ""Related"" because the visual content (cracked earth, dry lakebed) is consistent with the general concept of prolonged drought and dry reservoirs mentioned in the claim. However, the lack of precise information in the image prevents a stronger correlation and results in the low similarity score.  The image provides supporting context but doesn't offer direct verification of the claim.

The image (a screenshot from a seemingly unrelated news article) shows no mention of Jimmy Kimmel, Canada, or anything remotely connected to the claim.

The low similarity score (0.25) indicates a very weak connection.  A score closer to 1.0 would represent a strong match.  The low score reflects the complete lack of visual or textual overlap between the image content and the claim.

To analyze why the classification is accurate, consider these points:

* **Absence of Jimmy Kimmel:** The image contains no visual representation of Jimmy Kimmel, nor any text that mentions his name.
* **Absence of Canada:**  There's no mention of Canada, Canadian landmarks, or any reference to Canada geographically or otherwise.
* **Irrelevant Subject Matter:**  The text in the image is from a news article, but its topic is completely unrelated to entertainment news or Jimmy Kimmel.  The specific content is obscured, but the overall context is not about celebrity departures or immigration.
* **Visual Discrepancy:** The image depicts a typical news website layout, which visually contrasts sharply with the expected visual elements associated with a statement about a celebrity's departure (e.g., a photo of Kimmel, a screen capture of a show announcement, etc.).

In summary, the CLIP model correctly identifies the lack of any shared semantic meaning or visual cues between the image and the claim. The image is simply irrelevant to the information provided in the claim.  The low similarity score reflects this significant disconnect.

The claim ""Video shows Mexican firefighters going to help with California fires"" suggests a specific context:  Mexican firefighters actively participating in fire suppression efforts in California.  The image itself, however, lacks definitive evidence to directly support this claim.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.32 reflects this ambiguity.  A score of 0.32 indicates a weak to moderate relationship, far from a strong confirmation.  Here's a breakdown of why the classification is made, considering the image's limitations:

* **Absence of identifying markers:** The image doesn't display any clear indicators of nationality (e.g., Mexican flags, uniforms with distinctive insignia, vehicle markings). Firefighters' uniforms often look similar across different regions. Therefore, visually identifying them as Mexican solely based on appearance is unreliable.

* **Generic fire-fighting scene:** The scene depicts a fairly typical wildfire response situation.  Firefighters are present, presumably fighting a fire. This is visually consistent with the claim's general subject matter (firefighters dealing with fires), but doesn't specify *which* firefighters or *where* the fire is.

* **Environmental context:** The landscape could be in California or another region with similar vegetation.  The image doesn't provide geographical clues to definitively place it in California.

* **Lack of contextual information:**  The image is static.  A video would provide more information, such as movement, interactions, and potentially visible logos or markings on equipment that could point to the firefighters' origin. The still image lacks this crucial contextual information.

In summary, the CLIP model likely classified the image as ""Related"" because the image shows a scene consistent with *part* of the claim—firefighters fighting a fire.  However, the lack of specific visual evidence linking the firefighters to Mexico and the fire to California results in a low similarity score. The classification reflects a broad thematic connection rather than a strong, direct visual confirmation of the claim.  The missing video component significantly weakens the image's ability to support the claim.

Here's a breakdown of why the low similarity score is justified:

* **Different Entities:** The image shows a list of companies that donated to a political event, while the claim focuses on tech companies and a celebrity's donation to a disaster relief effort.  The sets of entities are largely non-overlapping.

* **Different Purposes of Donations:** The donations in the image are political contributions intended to support a presidential inauguration. The claim discusses charitable donations made to aid victims of a natural disaster.  These are fundamentally different types of giving with vastly different motivations.

* **Different Timeframes:** The image likely depicts donations made around the time of the Trump inauguration (2017). The claim refers to donations made in response to a LA fire (the specific fire isn't specified, making a precise timeframe impossible, but this is implied to be much more recent).  This temporal disconnect reduces relevance.

* **Absence of Key Entities:**  The claim explicitly names specific companies (Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Apple, and Uber) and a celebrity (Taylor Swift).  None of these entities are visible in the provided image.

In summary, the image and the claim share no relevant information. They address different subjects, different actors, and different contexts.

Here's a breakdown of why the low similarity score is appropriate:

* **Absence of Fire:** The most crucial factor is the complete lack of any visual evidence of fire.  No smoke plumes, burning structures, or flames are visible in the photograph. The cityscape appears normal and unmarred by fire damage.

* **Daytime Scene:** The image depicts a brightly lit daytime scene.  Wildfires, especially large ones, often generate significant smoke that obscures the skyline, particularly impacting visibility in daytime images.  The clear visibility in this image contradicts the claim of a fire.

* **Lack of Contextual Clues:** There are no contextual clues within the image suggesting a recent fire. No emergency vehicles, firefighting equipment, or any signs of evacuation or damage are present.

* **Focus on the Skyline:** The image's primary focus is on the architectural details of the Los Angeles skyline. This focus on a typical urban landscape further strengthens the ""Unrelated"" classification.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The low similarity score (0.24) reflects the significant difference between the expected visual content of an image depicting Los Angeles fires (smoke, flames, damage) and the actual content of the provided image (a clear view of the LA skyline).  This numerical score quantifies the lack of visual overlap between the image and the claim.

In summary, the CLIP model correctly identifies the disconnect between the claim of a video showing Los Angeles fires and the presented image, which depicts a normal, fire-free Los Angeles skyline.  The image provides no supporting evidence for the claim, resulting in the appropriate ""Unrelated"" classification and low similarity score.

This claim has no factual basis. The wildfires have destroyed thousands of homes in greater Los Angeles, belonging to both celebrities and noncelebrities.
State and local officials have said the Los Angeles wildfires’ cause remains under investigation and could take weeks or months to determine. High winds and dryness in Southern California have fueled the fires’ spread.

Federal agents already raided Combs’ Los Angeles and Miami homes in March, according to a federal indictment, seizing evidence that included narcotics, guns, ammunition and ""more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil and lubricant.""

* **Absence of any evidence related to Diddy or a cover-up:** Critically, the image contains absolutely no evidence of any conspiracy or connection to Sean ""Diddy"" Combs.  There are no individuals, objects, or markings that could reasonably support such a claim.


The CLIP model likely made the ""Related"" classification due to the presence of wildfire damage in Los Angeles, fulfilling a part of the claim.  It associated the visual representation of the wildfire with the textual description mentioning Los Angeles wildfires. The model doesn't possess the ability to understand context or reason; it identifies visual and textual similarities based on its training data. The ""Hollywood"" connection is tenuous at best, based solely on the geographic location being an area associated with the entertainment industry.

The low similarity score indicates that the model is recognizing the limited connection. It's essentially flagging a superficial link: ""wildfires in LA"" matches part of the claim, but the rest of the claim (conspiracy, Diddy) has no visual support whatsoever.  The model is not making a judgment on the plausibility of the conspiracy theory; it's simply detecting a partial match based on keywords and visual elements.  In conclusion, the relationship is extremely weak and relies on coincidental geographic overlap and a lack of the model's ability to understand the context of the claim.

Un oficial de información pública del Departamento de Silvicultura y Protección contra incendios de California nos dijo que esa imagen no parece ser de los recientes incendios en Los Ángeles. 
Al hacer una búsqueda de imagen inversa, PolitiFact encontró que la misma imagen de bomberos con la foto de la virgen y el Niño Jesús fue compartida varias veces en 2023 y 2024 en redes sociales, desde al menos el 11 de julio de 2023, antes de los incendios en California. Varias de las publicaciones dicen que la foto es de bomberos en Ruma, Serbia.
También encontramos un artículo de Alo!, un tabloide de Serbia del 7 de julio de 2023, mostrando un video de bomberos en Ruma, Serbia, sacando la imagen de la virgen de una casa destruida por llamas (el video muestra otro ángulo en comparación a la imagen en Facebook). Traducimos el artículo al español usando Google Translate, la traducción dice que la imagen parece haber sido sacada de un incendio y que salió intacta. 
Al buscar en internet fotos de bomberos en Serbia, encontramos que ellos usan los mismos uniformes negros con rayas fosforecentes que se ven en la publicación en Facebook. También buscamos imágenes de bomberos trabajando en los incendios de Los Ángeles y notamos que usualmente usan una chaqueta amarilla con rayas fosforecentes del mismo color y blancas y un pantalon negro.

Tampoco encontramos reportes verídicos en la base de noticias, Nexis, que digan que bomberos de California encontraron una imagen de la Virgen María o que posaron con una. 
Sin embargo, encontramos que una familia en California al ir a ver su casa que quedó destruida por los incendios en Eaton, notaron que una estatua de María y otra de San José ""estaban en perfecto estado"", según un reporte de Fox News del 12 de enero. 
Ya que no hay evidencia de que bomberos en California sostuvieron una imagen de la virgen junto al Niño Jesús, calificamos esta publicación como Falsa.

The image from the provided URL shows a group of firefighters, but *not* in Los Angeles, and *not* holding an image of the Virgin Mary.  The image depicts firefighters in what appears to be Serbia, based on the Reddit title.

Given this discrepancy, a similarity score of 0.29 from CLIP is surprisingly high, suggesting a potential misinterpretation or a weak correlation. The model likely established this weak link based on shared visual features rather than semantic understanding of the claim.

Here's how the connection might be established, despite the factual inaccuracies:

* **Shared Visual Elements:** Both the claim and the image contain firefighters. This is the primary, and likely only, significant overlap.  CLIP might identify the uniforms, the presence of hoses (potentially visible, though not clearly shown in the low-resolution preview), and the general context of what appears to be a firefighting operation as shared visual elements.

* **Lack of Specific Details:** The absence of any specific details in the image (like a picture of the Virgin Mary) limits the semantic understanding CLIP can draw. It cannot process the textual specifics of the claim (""Los Angeles,"" ""Nuestra Madre Santísima"").

* **Conceptual Association:**  While not directly present, there could be a loose conceptual link that CLIP picked up.  In many cultures, including those with significant Catholic populations, religious icons and symbols offer comfort and protection.  Firefighters face dangerous situations; CLIP might make a weak association between firefighters (present in both claim and image) and the invocation of a protective religious figure (implicitly suggested by the claim).  This is highly speculative, however, and not a strong basis for the correlation.

* **Limitations of CLIP:** CLIP is a powerful tool but not perfect. Its understanding is based on statistical correlations learned from vast datasets. It may not fully grasp the nuances of context, location, and specific religious iconography.  A low similarity score coupled with visual overlap is evidence of the model's limitations in interpreting the subtle differences between the image and the textual claim.

In conclusion, the 0.29 similarity score reflects a weak correlation primarily driven by the shared visual element of firefighters. The significant factual inaccuracies regarding location and the presence of a religious icon explain the relatively low score despite identifying a superficial commonality. The connection is purely visual and lacks any robust semantic understanding of the claim's specifics.

""So L.A, Hollywood, and California (get) 100% aid for the next 180 days while Western North Carolina got $750. Got it,"" read one Jan. 10 Facebook post that included a string of disbelieving, angry emojis. ""I am so angry about this so many are still in the cold here.""
Some critics seized on California’s Democratic political leanings to explain what they described as a lopsided federal response. 
""When a blue state needs bailing out, Dems say spare no expense,"" read the screenshot of an X post shared Jan. 9 on Instagram. ""If you live in a Republican state, then you get a $750 loan."" 
The X post was made in response to President Joe Biden’s statement that said the federal government would ""cover 100% of the cost of measures to protect lives and property in Southern California for six months.""

These claims conflated two distinct forms of federal assistance — both of which were offered to support people in both states’ disaster-stricken communities — to inaccurately assert that the assistance offered to California was more comprehensive than what North Carolinians received. 
No two disasters are exactly the same and it’s too soon to say exactly how much money will be spent in either place. But the federal response to the California wildfires has so far mimicked the government’s response to Hurricane Helene hitting North Carolina. 
On its ""Hurricane Helene: Rumor Response"" page, FEMA said it hadn’t shifted resources away from North Carolina to respond to the wildfires, as some people had claimed. 
""FEMA has enough funding to support recovery efforts in multiple areas, including communities affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton as well as response efforts in California,"" the agency wrote. ""The supplemental funding bill approved by Congress on December 20, 2024 included $29 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund. FEMA is supporting over 100 major disasters and will continue to support the recovery in these communities for as long as it takes."" 
Federal cost share for disaster response was increased to 100% in both places. 
In late September 2024, Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida. The storm then advanced north, causing devastating flooding in western North Carolina on Sept. 27. The next day, Biden approved a disaster declaration for North Carolina.
The Palisades fire in Los Angeles began as a brushfire Jan. 7. Biden approved a disaster declaration for California Jan. 8. 
The disaster declarations made federal funding available to the hurricane and wildfire victims in each state. 
""Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster,"" the White House statements said. 
Both statements said federal funding was available to state, tribal and eligible local governments ""on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work"" in affected counties in both states. ""Finally, Federal funding is available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures statewide,"" the statements said.  
In both instances, Biden later increased the percentage of costs the federal government would take on for emergency work: 
""The President authorized the federal cost-share to be increased from 75% to 100% for the first 180 days of the incident period,"" the Federal Emergency Management Agency said Oct. 2 about Hurricane Helene’s destruction in North Carolina. 
""The President authorized the federal cost-share to be increased from 75% to 100% for a period of 180 days of the state’s choosing within the first 270 days of the incident period,"" FEMA said of the California wildfires Jan. 14.

“JD Vance is in North Carolina, and he’s found furnished apartments to put the people in that have been living in tents.”
By Madison Czopek • January 30, 2025
Emergency payments: North Carolinians qualified for $750. Californians qualify for $770. 
On Jan. 13, Biden encouraged wildfire victims to apply for one-time $770 payments for emergency supplies. 
That $770 payment Biden mentioned is the same assistance as the one-time $750 payment made available to 2024 hurricane victims — the difference being a $20 annual cost-of-living increase, Federal Emergency Management Agency spokesperson Jayce Genco said.
These one-time payments come from FEMA’s Serious Needs Assistance program, which covers the cost of immediate emergency supplies such as water, food, first aid, baby formula diapers and personal hygiene items, Genco said. If people had to evacuate and stayed in hotels, the money could go toward those costs or toward the cost of fuel needed to evacuate, he told PolitiFact on Jan. 14. 
The one-time payments are initial payments provided to people as they await other assistance they might qualify for, according to FEMA’s website. In California and North Carolina, victims of the natural disasters who receive these initial payments might qualify for additional aid. 
Our ruling
A Facebook post said that after the damaging Los Angeles wildfires, ""California gets 100% aid for the next 180 days while Western North Carolina got $750.""
The posts conflated two kinds of federal assistance while saying North Carolina hurricane victims received only $750 in federal aid. That’s inaccurate — those one-time Serious Needs Assistance payments in North Carolina were initial aid people could use for emergency supplies as they awaited other assistance. California wildfire victims can apply for those payments, too. 
In both instances, Biden declared disasters and later increased the percentage of costs the federal government would absorb for emergency work to 100%. 
The federal response to the California wildfires has so far mimicked the government’s response to Hurricane Helene hitting North Carolina. 
We rate this claim False.

The image shows a relatively localized scene of wildfire damage – specifically, the aftermath of a wildfire in the Palisades area, presumably somewhere in or near Los Angeles.  There is visible smoke, burnt vegetation, and what appears to be a residential area impacted by the fire.

The claim, however, compares the level of disaster aid received by a vast geographic region (Los Angeles, Hollywood, and all of California) to a much smaller region (Western North Carolina).  The image provides visual evidence of *one specific instance* of wildfire damage within a small part of Los Angeles. It does not offer any information regarding the total amount of aid received by California as a whole, nor does it offer any visual representation of the conditions in Western North Carolina.

Here's a breakdown of why the elements in the image are not relevant to the claim:

* **Scale:** The image's scope is extremely localized. The claim discusses state-level aid distribution.  Even if the image showed widespread damage throughout Los Angeles, it wouldn't visually support the claim's assertion about the total aid received by the entire state.
* **Focus:** The image centers on the physical consequences of a wildfire – destruction of property.  The claim deals with the financial consequences – the distribution of aid. These are related but distinct concepts.  The image doesn't represent the allocation of funds.
* **Lack of Data:** The image doesn't contain any numerical data or other information about disaster aid.  To be relevant, it would need to show data supporting or refuting the claim's assertion about 100% aid for California versus a smaller sum for Western North Carolina.
* **Regional Disparity:** The claim highlights a regional disparity in aid distribution. The image shows only one side of that disparity (potential damage in a part of California), neglecting the conditions and aid received in Western North Carolina.

In short, the image provides context to *one potential reason* why California might require disaster aid, but it offers no evidence supporting or refuting the *specific quantitative claim* regarding the *relative amounts* of aid received by California versus Western North Carolina.  Therefore, the low similarity score and ""Unrelated"" classification are appropriate.

One-third of U.S. adults said in 2023 they used TikTok, up 12 percentage points from 2021, Pew Research found.

Trump’s 2020 words and actions showed support for TikTok ban
In July 2020, Trump began signaling his intention to ban TikTok — partly as retaliation for the COVID-19 pandemic, which he blamed on China, where TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, is based. His campaign released political ads on Facebook and Instagram accusing TikTok of ""spying"" on users.
""Do you think we should ban TikTok? Sign the petition NOW!"" one ad, which has since been deleted, said.
At that time, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Trump administration officials were ""looking at"" a TikTok ban.
Trump was asked about a potential ban following Pompeo’s remarks.
""It’s something we’re looking at, yes,"" Trump said in an interview with Gray Television, Bloomberg News reported. ""It’s a big business. Look, what happened with China with this virus, what they’ve done to this country and to the entire world is disgraceful.""
On Aug. 6, 2020, Trump signed Executive Order 13942, which sought to ban TikTok, citing national security concerns.
""At this time, action must be taken to address the threat posed by one mobile application in particular, TikTok ... The United States must take aggressive action against the owners of TikTok to protect our national security,"" Trump wrote in the order.
Trump argued that TikTok’s data collection practices threatened ""to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans’ personal and proprietary information,"" which could be used for blackmail and corporate espionage.
The order sought to apply its TikTok ban within 45 days unless ByteDance agreed to sell the app to a U.S. company. American companies including Microsoft Corp., Oracle Corp. and Walmart lined up to make an offer that would have sold off TikTok’s business in the U.S. and some other countries.
But two federal courts struck down Trump’s order in October 2020. A month later, Trump lost the presidential election.

Trump joined TikTok and opposed the ban in 2024 
In 2024, as a presidential candidate, Trump said he opposed a ban.

In response to a bipartisan congressional bill that sought to ban TikTok, Trump said he no longer favored a ban because it would help Meta. 
""If you get rid of TikTok, Facebook and Zuckerschmuck will double their business,"" he wrote on TruthSocial on March 7, 2024, referring to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. (Post-election, Trump and Zuckerberg have become allies. )

By Amy Sherman • February 5, 2025
On March 11, 2024, Trump told CNBC that although he considered TikTok’s national security and privacy concerns, the company was not the only social media platform with those problems.
In a subsequent interview that month on Fox News, Trump said he opposed a ban because ""there is a danger with banning it, with you know, freedom of speech."" 
Trump also denied accusations from some of his supporters, including political strategist Steve Bannon, that he had reversed his position after a March meeting with Jeff Yass, a major Republican donor who owns a 7% share, worth about $21 billion, of ByteDance, NBC News reported. Trump told Fox News he didn’t know about Yass’ link to the company when they met and said they didn’t talk about TikTok.
In a June 2, 2024, statement, a day after joining TikTok, Trump said he created the account ""to use every tool available to speak directly with the American people about how Joe Biden's failed presidency is tearing apart our beautiful nation and how I am going to stop him."" 
After winning the election, Trump continued to speak favorably about the app. Asked at a Dec. 16, 2024, press conference about whether he’ll try to stop the TikTok ban, Trump said, ""I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok."" 
On Dec. 27, 2024, Trump filed a brief with the Supreme Court, asking justices to stay the ban’s Jan. 19 effective date to let his administration negotiate a resolution.
""President Trump opposes banning TikTok in the United States at this juncture, and seeks the ability to resolve the issues at hand through political means once he takes office,"" the brief stated.

In July 2020, Trump said, ""As far as TikTok is concerned, we’re banning them from the United States."" The next month, he signed an executive order that sought to ban the app; courts struck it down.
During the 2024 campaign, Trump spoke often against a ban. In a December filing with the Supreme Court, Trump said he ""opposes banning TikTok in the United States at this juncture.""
Trump has completely changed his position on a TikTok ban. That meets our definition of a Full Flop.

The chart itself is directly related to the claim ""On banning TikTok"" because it visually represents public opinion data concerning that very topic.  The presence of demographic breakdowns (e.g., age, party affiliation) further contextualizes the debate around a potential TikTok ban, showing how support or opposition varies across different segments of the population.

Despite the clear relevance, the relatively low CLIP similarity score of 0.30 suggests that the relationship isn't strongly captured by the model's visual understanding.  This is likely due to several factors:

* **Abstraction of the data:** CLIP excels at recognizing concrete objects and scenes, but struggles with the abstract representation of data in charts.  It might not fully grasp the significance of the bar chart's variations in height representing differing levels of support/opposition.  The model sees colors, bars, and labels, but doesn't necessarily understand the *meaning* encoded within the chart.

* **Textual limitations:** While the chart has titles and labels, CLIP's processing of text is often less robust than its visual processing.  It may not fully interpret the meaning of the textual elements like ""Ban TikTok"" or the demographic labels, preventing it from completely understanding the chart's context and its relationship to the claim.

* **Lack of visual cues to ""banning"":** The image doesn't contain visual elements directly associated with the *act* of banning. There are no images of government officials, legal documents, or symbols representing prohibition.  The visual information is purely data-driven, which is less directly related to the action implied by ""banning"" than, for example, an image of a phone with a TikTok app being deleted.

In summary, while the image is undeniably relevant to the claim ""On banning TikTok"" because it presents data on public opinion regarding the ban, CLIP's relatively low similarity score reflects its limitations in interpreting charts and the abstract nature of the data visualization.  It can identify the visual components but struggles to connect them semantically to the meaning and implications of the claim about a potential TikTok ban. The score reflects the gap between visual recognition and conceptual understanding.

Los oficiales de bomberos de Los Ángeles también dijeron a TMZ que las bolsas de lona son parte del equipo estándar de los bomberos. Estas son fáciles de llenar con agua para apagar pequeños incendios, y son más rápidas de usar que conectar mangueras a los hidrantes, según dijeron los oficiales.
Una búsqueda de imágenes inversa mostró que el clip de los bomberos con las bolsas es parte de un video más largo publicado el 8 de enero por OnScene.TV, un canal de YouTube que se describe como ""fotoperiodistas que cubren noticias de última hora"".

The low score reflects the weak connection.

The image depicts firefighters battling a wildfire, showing intense flames, smoke, and firefighters actively engaged in firefighting activities.  Crucially, **there are no women's handbags visible anywhere in the image.**

The relationship, however tenuous, arises from the *context* provided by the claim.  The claim suggests an unconventional and somewhat improbable method of water collection (using women's handbags) during a wildfire. The image shows a wildfire, and firefighters working to combat the fire.  This creates a semantic link: both relate to the general concept of a wildfire and firefighting efforts.  The CLIP model likely detected keywords like ""fire,"" ""firefighters,"" and ""Los Angeles"" (implied by the context of the claim and potentially present in metadata associated with the image), linking them despite the lack of visual evidence supporting the specific claim about handbags.

The low similarity score (0.25) is a direct reflection of the lack of visual overlap.  The image doesn't provide any visual support for the specific and unusual claim made in the text. The connection is entirely based on the shared general topic of wildfire fighting, not specific details.  If the image had shown firefighters improvising with any kind of container to collect water, the similarity score might have been higher.  However, the claim's specificity regarding women's handbags is entirely absent from the visual content.  Therefore, the classification is correctly identifying a weak semantic relationship based on general context rather than direct visual evidence.

Maudro se juramentó sin mostrar pruebas de que ganó las elecciones del 28 de julio 2024 contra el candidato de la oposición Edmundo González. González presentó actas electorales mostrándolo como el ganador de las elecciones venezolanas. Sin embargo, el Consejo Nacional Electoral de Venezuela, sin que se publicarán detalles de las actas electorales, proclamó a Maduro como presidente.
La posesión de Maduro ha sido criticada y sancionada por varios países, incluyendo Canadá, Reino Unido y Estados Unidos. 
En un comunicado del 10 de enero, el Departamento del Tesoro de Estados Unidos describe sanciones que la administración del Presidente Joe Biden impuso a funcionarios ""que permiten la represión por parte de Nicolás Maduro y la subversión de la democracia en Venezuela"".
Este también menciona que el Departamento de Estado ofrece hasta $25 millones por información que conduzca al arresto y/o condena de Maduro y de Diosdado Cabello, ministro de Interior, Justicia y Paz en Venezuela (hasta $25 millones por cada uno). El Departamento de Estado también impuso una recompensa de $15 millones por información que lleve al arresto del ministro de Defensa Vladimir Padrino.
Pero este comunicado no amenaza a Venezuela con una intervención militar, ni tampoco habla de una preparación militar para derrocar a Maduro. 
El Departamento de Estado le dijo a PolitiFact por correo electrónico que no hay evidencia de un plan para derrocar a Maduro. 
Un portavoz dijo que Estados Unidos reafirma su apoyo a los venezolanos a aspirar por un cambio democratico y pacīfico y que elogian el valor de los venezolanos y su compromiso a la democracia en medio de la represión. 
El Secretario de Estado de Estados Unidos, Anthony Blinken dijo el 10 de enero en X: ""La gente venezolana y el mundo saben que Nicolas Maduro claramente perdió las elecciones presidenciales de 2024 y no tiene derecho a asumir la presidencia hoy. Nos mantenemos listos para apoyar un regreso a la democracia en Venezuela"". 
Pero Blinken tampoco ha dicho en sus redes sociales o en comunicados sobre una preparación militar para entrar a Venezuela. 
La publicación en Instagram mostró una imagen de Mayorkas, como si él hubiera hablado sobre una posible preparación militar, pero no encontramos que él haya dicho eso.

Por Marta Campabadal Graus • Enero 24, 2025
El 10 de enero, Mayorkas anunció la extensión del Estatus de Protección Temporal para Venezuela por 18 meses, la cual permite a venezolanos mantenerse en EEUU. La extensión es debido a una crisis bajo Maduro que ha llevado a altos niveles de crimen y violencia, impactando el acceso a alimentos, medicinas y otras necesidades básicas, según un comunicado del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional.
González también se reunió con Biden el 6 de enero donde Biden lo llamó presidente electo de Venezuela. En esta reunión discutieron planes para restaurar la democracia, según un comunicado de la Casa Blanca, pero Biden no dijo que Estados Unidos se está preparando para entrar a Venezuela. 
El presidente electo Donald Trump también publicó el 9 de enero en Truth Social su apoyo hacia la líder de la oposición Maria Corina Machado y reconoció a González como presidente electo de Venezuela. Trump también dijo que ellos ""no debían ser heridos y que debían mantenerse a salvo y vivos"".
Él publicó eso después que Machado volvió a la luz pública el 9 de enero luego de meses de estar resguardada para una protesta pacífica de los venezolanos en donde reivindicaron la victoria de la oposición en 2024. Machado fue interceptada por fuerzas de seguridad armadas al salir de la protesta y luego liberada, según ella contó en un video. 
Pero Trump no mencionó una intervención militar cuando él tome la presidencia el 20 de enero.
Estados Unidos rechazó la toma de posesión de Maduro como presidente, pero no hay evidencia de que la milicia estadounidense se esté preparando para entrar a Venezuela y derrocar a Maduro.

The claim, ""“El ejército de Los Estados Unidos se encuentra preparado para entrar a Venezuela a derrocar la dictadura de Nicolás Maduro” (The United States Army is prepared to enter Venezuela to overthrow Nicolás Maduro's dictatorship),"" directly relates to the potential for military conflict in Venezuela.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.28 suggests a weak but discernible connection between the image and the claim. The low similarity score indicates that the connection isn't strong, which is reasonable given the image itself doesn't directly depict US troops or imminent invasion.  The connection is made through indirect association:

* **Contextual Relevance:** The image represents the Venezuelan military, which is the target of the claim's assertion of potential US intervention.  The image shows the force that a US invasion would potentially encounter.  The presence of the Venezuelan military evokes the context of potential conflict.

* **Subject Matter Association:** Both the image and the claim revolve around Venezuela and its military situation.  They both deal with the political and potentially military climate within the country.  This shared subject matter is sufficient for CLIP to detect some level of relationship.

* **Lack of Direct Evidence:** The image lacks any explicit mention of the US military or any suggestion of an imminent invasion. There are no US flags, soldiers, or equipment visible. This lack of direct visual evidence explains the low similarity score.  The image doesn't visually support the claim; it simply relates to the overall context within which the claim is made.

In summary, CLIP likely classified the image as ""Related"" because of the shared thematic context of Venezuelan military forces and the political instability that makes a US intervention plausible.  The low similarity score accurately reflects the indirect nature of this relationship. The image depicts a potential target of the action described in the claim, but offers no visual evidence to support or refute the claim itself.

“FEMA has been directed back to North Carolina with $2 billion in emergency funds: ‘We transferred it from the programs that fund welfare for illegals. They don’t be needing it.’”
By Ciara O'Rourke • January 24, 2025
Federal Emergency Management Agency spokesperson Jayce Genco said the one-time $770 payment would come from FEMA’s Serious Needs Assistance program. It aims to cover the cost of immediate emergency supplies such as water, food, first aid, baby formula diapers and personal hygiene items. If people had to evacuate and stayed in hotels, it could go toward those costs or toward the cost of fuel needed to evacuate, he said. 
The $770 payment is the same as the one-time $750 payment that was available to 2024 hurricane victims — with a $20 annual cost-of-living increase, Genco said.
As of Jan. 13, almost 6,000 survivors had applied for the $770 payments and more than $5 million had been sent out, Biden said. 
It is inaccurate to characterize the $770 payment as the only aid available. Biden declared a major disaster, meaning that fire victims can get different types of federal individual assistance alongside the Serious Needs Assistance. 
""This is one of many programs that FEMA has to help people,"" Genco said. ""Folks could be eligible for temporary housing. They could be eligible for repairs on their home. They could be eligible for some of the hazard mitigation assistance programs that we have."" 
FEMA’s Individuals and Households Program supports disaster victims and can provide money for things such as temporary housing during disaster-related displacement and funds to repair or replace primary residences that were damaged, according to the agency’s website. The program can also provide money for future hazard mitigation. For people with wildfire-damaged homes, that might include the costs of covering attic and crawlspace vents or installing noncombustible gutters and leaf guards, FEMA said. 
People can apply for federal disaster assistance by visiting www.disasterassistance.gov or calling 1-800-621-3362.

The image shows a relatively formal press conference setting.  The central figure appears to be a government official (possibly, but not definitively, a representative of the Biden administration) speaking at a podium.  There is no mention of the wildfire, a specific dollar amount ($770), or the loss of homes or belongings in the image itself.  The visual content is generic enough to apply to numerous government press conferences on various unrelated topics.  There's no visible text mentioning wildfire aid, financial assistance, or the Biden administration's response to any specific disaster.

The claim, on the other hand, is a very specific statement about the amount of financial aid offered by the Biden administration in response to a particular disaster (the Los Angeles wildfires).  This requires concrete evidence, likely in the form of official government documents or news reports detailing the aid package.  The image provides no such evidence.

Therefore, the low similarity score accurately reflects the absence of any visual connection between the image's content and the specific details of the claim.  The image shows a general press conference; the claim asserts a precise figure for disaster relief.  These two are entirely unrelated without additional contextual information.  CLIP correctly identifies this lack of semantic overlap.

The provided image (from Swissinfo.ch) shows a landscape photograph, seemingly taken from a high vantage point, depicting a vast expanse of mountainous terrain with sparse vegetation and what appears to be some form of smoke or haze in the distance. There are no people visible in the image, no signs of celebration, and no discernible connection to Los Angeles or wildfires specifically.

Here's a breakdown of why the low similarity score and ""Unrelated"" classification are correct:

* **Absence of People:** The claim explicitly mentions ""Israeli tourists celebrating."" The image lacks any human presence whatsoever.  CLIP likely identifies the presence or absence of people as a key feature when assessing the relationship between the image and the textual claim.

* **Lack of Celebratory Context:** Even if people were present, there are no visible signs of celebration—no cheering, fireworks, celebratory gestures, or anything suggestive of joyous activity. The image is purely scenic, lacking any elements that could be interpreted as celebratory.

* **Ambiguous Smoke/Haze:** The presence of smoke or haze in the distance could *potentially* be interpreted as wildfire smoke, but this is highly speculative. The image offers no definitive proof of a wildfire, and certainly nothing that links it to Los Angeles.  The resolution is insufficient to make any definite determination of the source or nature of the haze.

* **Absence of Locational Clues:** There are no landmarks or other visual clues that definitively place the image in Los Angeles or any other specific location.  The mountainous landscape could be anywhere.

* **Low Resolution and Detail:** The relatively low resolution of the image may have hindered CLIP's ability to detect subtle details that might, under different circumstances, have suggested a connection.  However, even with higher resolution, the lack of people and celebratory elements would remain the dominant factors.

In summary, the image provides no visual evidence to support the claim. It's a generic landscape photo with ambiguous atmospheric conditions, lacking any of the key elements mentioned in the claim (Israeli tourists, celebration, and a clear connection to the Los Angeles wildfires).  Therefore, the CLIP model's ""Unrelated"" classification and low similarity score are a reasonable and accurate reflection of the image's content and its lack of relevance to the claim.

Here's a breakdown of why the low similarity score is appropriate:

* **Absence of Fires:** The statement directly refers to wildfires and the hypothetical ability to control them through rain.  The image contains no visual evidence of any active or recent wildfires.  The focus is entirely on the lack of water, a condition *that can contribute* to fire risk but doesn't show active fire itself.

* **Indirect Relationship:** While drought conditions (as depicted in the image) increase the risk of wildfires, the image doesn't directly depict the consequence (fires) mentioned in the statement.  The connection is inferential, not explicit.  CLIP, as a model focusing on direct visual-textual correspondence, struggles with such indirect links.

* **Focus on Drought, Not Fire Suppression:** The image powerfully communicates the severity of drought.  The cracked earth is a strong visual representation of water scarcity.  The statement, however, talks about the *active suppression* of fires, a completely different aspect of the broader problem of drought and fire risk.

* **Lack of Human Intervention:** The statement implies human agency (""they"").  The image shows a natural landscape impacted by drought; there are no visible signs of human intervention in fire suppression (e.g., firefighters, equipment, smoke).

In essence, the image showcases a contributing factor to wildfires (drought), while the statement discusses the hypothetical control of wildfires themselves.  The semantic gap between the visual depiction of drought and the textual description of fire suppression leads to the low similarity score and the ""Unrelated"" classification by CLIP.  The model accurately reflects that the image doesn't visually support the assertion in the statement.

Lawmakers craft a new spending plan every two years. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and Republicans who control the Legislature often disagree on whether to spend the state’s extra funds on programs, or give it back as tax cuts. 
Evers touted the state’s current financial standing Dec. 28, 2024, in an X post.
""After 30 years of Wisconsin's checking account running a deficit, we've ended every fiscal year I've been governor with a positive balance,"" he said. 
""Today, we have a $4.5 billion positive balance, and a record-high balance in our state savings account,"" Evers added. 
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
Wisconsin’s ""checking account"" refers to the general fund and its ""savings account"" is called the ""rainy day"" fund. We’ll refer to both in this fact-check.
The general fund is where the state’s tax collections go, including income taxes, sales taxes and corporate taxes. 
The ""rainy day"" fund is home to excess tax revenue. It’s reserved in case the state takes in less revenue one year or spends more than expected. That’s helpful in a mild economic downturn, for example.
With budget season approaching, let’s examine whether each part of Evers’ claim is correct. Along the way, we’ll try our best to explain the state government’s complicated financial accounts. 
Did Wisconsin’s general fund end with a positive balance each year under Evers?
PolitiFact Wisconsin contacted the governor’s office, and Communications Director Britt Cudaback directed us to several sources, including the state’s Annual Comprehensive Financial Report.
Here’s where things get confusing. The report is based on fiscal years, which run from the beginning of July to the end of June in Wisconsin.
Cudaback said the claim treats 2020 as the first fiscal year under Evers’ leadership. Although Evers introduced his first budget in 2019, he took office halfway through that fiscal year. 
The 2017-19 budget former Republican Gov. Scott Walker signed was still in place then, Cudaback said. So, we’ll start at fiscal year 2020.
Now, let’s see whether the general fund had a positive balance at the end of fiscal years 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024. 
The 2020 report showed a general fund balance of $1.5 million at the end of the year. 
In the next years, the balance reached the billions: $1.2 billion in 2021, $4.6 billion in 2022, $6.7 billion in 2023 and $4.5 billion in 2024.
So, the first part of Evers’ claim is correct. There was a positive balance — or a ""surplus"" — in the state’s general fund for each fiscal year he’s been in office.
Did Wisconsin’s general fund have a deficit for 30 years before Evers?
Let’s look at part two of Evers’ claim: Did the general fund have a negative balance, or ""deficit,"" for 30 years before he became governor?
For this piece, Cudaback pointed to a 2021 report from the nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy Forum. The report found the general fund had a surplus for the first time since 1990. That’s 30 years since Evers took office.
""For the first time on record, Wisconsin’s main fund closed the year with a small positive balance, wiping out the longstanding financial gap that was often referred to as a ‘deficit,’"" the report says.
That was partly because of federal pandemic aid flowing into Wisconsin. The surplus fell this year because that money dried up, and the general fund is now spending more than it’s taking in, a December forum report said.
Those 30 years included both Democratic and Republican administrations. But Evers is still correct that the general fund ran a negative balance for three decades before he became governor.
Does the state have a record-high balance in its ""rainy day"" fund?
The Legislative Fiscal Bureau has a chart that shows the balance of the ""rainy day"" fund between 2003-04 and 2021-22. It shows Wisconsin’s ""savings account"" did reach its highest balance in 2022, at $1.7 billion.
The December Wisconsin Policy Forum report provides more recent numbers and projections: $1.8 billion in 2023, $1.9 billion in 2024 and $2 billion in 2025.
Jason Stein, president of the Wisconsin Policy Forum, confirmed to PolitiFact Wisconsin that those are state records even if adjusted for inflation.

Rhode Island spends less than 10 percent of what the average state spends promoting tourism.
By C. Eugene Emery Jr. • December 12, 2010
So, yes, Wisconsin’s ""rainy day"" fund is growing and currently sits at a record balance.
Does Evers deserve credit for these positive balances?
Finally, one last piece.  Although Evers doesn’t directly take credit for the state’s financial health in his tweet, it’s certainly implied. 
Cudaback provided several examples of Evers’ actions, like using extra revenue to pay off state debt in 2019 and transferring general fund money to the state’s capital budget in 2023 to prevent new borrowing. 
But the full picture is more complicated. Republicans have also taken credit for the surplus, pointing out their role in reining in Evers’ spending proposals. 
In 2023, Evers pitched a $104 billion budget, which Republicans mostly tossed and rewrote from scratch. The Wisconsin Policy Forum noted that if approved in full, Evers’ plan would have left the state with a deficit.
However, Stein pointed out, Evers has vetoed Republican tax cut proposals, keeping the general fund higher than it would have been if he approved the cuts. 
""To some degree, both the Legislature and the governor in the last budget did some things that were favorable in terms of boosting the general fund balance,"" Stein said. 
But each also had ""proposals that would have been less favorable (to the general fund) that were blocked by the other side. So in that sense, it was sort of a joint effort.""
Beyond the political element, there’s also the overall state of the economy. 
If there was a recession, for example, tax collections from businesses could decline and the state might need to increase spending for people who lose their jobs and enroll in Medicaid, Stein said. 
So, Wisconsin’s financial health can’t really be credited to one person. But again, Evers doesn’t explicitly take responsibility in his tweet. 
Our ruling
The three parts of Evers’ claim are correct: Wisconsin’s general fund has ended with a surplus each year he’s been governor, the fund had a deficit before that, and the ""rainy day"" fund is at a record balance. 
The state’s general fund surplus actually went down in the last year, in part because federal pandemic aid that boosted Wisconsin’s finances has dried up. 
Although Evers doesn’t explicitly take credit for the state’s financial well-being, he definitely hints at it. There’s evidence to support his involvement, the full picture is bigger.

Let's analyze why this is the case, despite the apparent thematic relevance.

The image shows Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers and presumably another individual (possibly a staff member or fellow politician).  The setting appears to be a formal or semi-formal office environment. There's no visible text in the image directly relating to budget surpluses or deficits. The visual elements are purely people and a background suggesting a governmental setting.

The claim, however, directly addresses Wisconsin's state budget, highlighting a significant shift from long-term deficits to a substantial surplus under Governor Evers' tenure.  

The weak correlation stems from the lack of explicit visual connection between the image and the claim.  The image provides context—it shows Governor Evers—but doesn't visually represent the claim's core message of fiscal success.  There's no graph, chart, document, or any other visual element depicting budgetary data.

A higher similarity score would have been generated if the image contained:

* **A graph showing Wisconsin's budget balance over time:** Visually demonstrating the transition from deficit to surplus would strongly correlate with the claim.
* **A document or press release:** A visible headline mentioning the budget surplus would create a much stronger link.
* **Governor Evers holding a document or pointing to a screen displaying financial data:** This would directly connect the visual with the claim's content.
* **A visual representation of the $4.5 billion figure:**  A symbolic representation (e.g., a large check) would strengthen the connection.

The 0.27 score likely reflects that the connection relies solely on the presence of Governor Evers, who is indirectly linked to the claim's subject matter.  The image provides circumstantial evidence, but lacks the direct visual representation necessary for a stronger correlation according to CLIP.  CLIP, being a multimodal model, heavily relies on the visual information being directly congruent with the textual information.  The lack of such visual cues leads to the relatively low similarity score.

California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, recently launched a website to combat disinformation about Southern California’s wildfires.
One of the rumors, described as a ""lie"" on the site, is that ""firefighters are using women’s purses to fight fires."" The website says this is false: ""The LAFD uses canvas bags to fight small trash fires because they are more efficient for extinguishing fires than a long hose.""
According to Snopes, the fire department said in an email that the firefighters are not using handbags: ""Our firefighters are resilient and will continually adapt to various situations. They are using collapsible water buckets to put out this trash bin fire, not bags.""

Los Angeles fire officials also told TMZ that the bags are part of the firefighters' standard equipment. The bags are easy to fill with water  for dousing small fires, and are quicker to use than connecting hoses to hydrants, officials said.
Using a reverse-image search, PolitiFact found that the firefighting clip with the bags is part of a longer video posted Jan. 8 by OnScene.TV, a YouTube channel that describes itself as ""photojournalists covering breaking news stories."" The original video is 22 minutes long and says it shows the Palisades fire in greater Los Angeles. There is no mention of ""women’s handbags.""

The scene depicts a typical firefighting operation,  consistent with the general expectations of such an event.

The claim, ""The LAFD are using women’s handbags to hold water to put out fires,"" is absurd and implausible.  Firefighting requires specialized equipment designed to handle high volumes of water under pressure. Handbags are utterly unsuitable for this purpose.

CLIP's classification of ""Unrelated"" with a low similarity score of 0.25 is entirely justified.  There is no visual overlap between the content of the image (firefighters using professional equipment) and the claim (firefighters using women's handbags).

CLIP's classification of ""Unrelated"" with a low similarity score of 0.19 is entirely justified.  Here's why:

* **No mention of Trump or New Jersey:** The image contains no textual or visual references to Donald Trump, New Jersey, or any land transfer agreements.  The claim entirely hinges on a political statement; the image is devoid of any political content.

* **Historical context vs. contemporary political event:** The image is firmly rooted in the past, illustrating historical details. The claim, however, is about a contemporary political event (a hypothetical statement from a political figure).  These are fundamentally different contexts.

* **Visual mismatch:**  There's no visual overlap between the image's content (a historical marker) and the claim's content (a political statement about land transfer).  The image focuses on historical facts, while the claim is a modern political statement.

* **Low semantic similarity:** The semantic distance between the concepts represented in the image (local history, historical marker, possibly Staten Island's past) and the claim (political statement, land transfer, Trump) is extremely high. CLIP correctly identifies this lack of conceptual overlap.


In short, CLIP's assessment reflects a rational understanding of the image and claim. The image's sole focus on historical details lacks any connection to the claim's political context.  The low similarity score appropriately reflects this significant lack of relationship.

Neither Newsom nor California Democrats decriminalized looting. It remains illegal in California during a state of emergency, which Newsom declared Jan. 7 in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, or under an evacuation order. 
The state’s Penal Code 463, under the ""Burglary"" chapter, says that every person who commits burglary or grand theft ""during and within an affected county in a ‘state of emergency’ or a ‘local emergency,’ or under an ‘evacuation order,’ resulting from an earthquake, fire, flood, riot, or other natural (or manmade) disaster shall be guilty of the crime of looting, punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for (up to three years.)""

In August, Newsom signed a bipartisan package of 10 bills on retail crime and property theft. None of those decriminalized looting.
President-elect Donald Trump had claimed falsely that because of Proposition 47, California does not charge people with a crime if the stolen goods are worth less than $950. According to that law, which California voters approved in 2014, people who steal items worth less than $950 would be charged with a misdemeanor. The law’s text does not mention looting.
In November 2024, California voters approved Proposition 36, which rolled back some of Proposition 47’s provisions, allowing offenders with two previous theft convictions to be charged with a felony, ""regardless of the value of the stolen property."" Newsom opposed the proposition; supporters of the legislation said it was needed because of increased property crime during the pandemic.

The classification of ""Related"" with a low similarity score (0.25) to the claim ""California Gov. Gavin Newsom and California Democrats ‘literally decriminalized looting’"" is understandable given the limited contextual information provided by the image alone.  CLIP's analysis is based purely on visual elements and doesn't access external knowledge.

Here's a breakdown of why the relationship is weak despite the ""Related"" classification:

* **Visual Elements Lacking Direct Connection:** The image likely depicts a crowd of people, possibly engaging in protest activity. There's no direct visual evidence of looting.  No signs explicitly mention Newsom, California Democrats, or looting.  The image's content is generic enough to represent many forms of protest or civil unrest.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The score of 0.25 indicates a very weak relationship. CLIP likely detected a tenuous link, perhaps based on:
    * **Association of Protests with Political Action:**  Protests are often associated with political disagreements and policy changes.  The claim involves a political change (alleged decriminalization of looting).  This indirect association might account for the weak positive correlation.
    * **Potential for Looting in Unrest:**  While not depicted, the image *could* represent a context where looting *might* occur. This is a very broad and speculative connection.

* **Missing Context:** The image's context is crucial.  Knowing the specific event depicted (the time, location, and cause of the protest) would significantly impact the image's relevance to the claim.  Without this context, the image's relevance is purely speculative.

In essence, CLIP's ""Related"" classification is likely a result of a weak, indirect association based on general visual cues. The low similarity score emphasizes the tenuousness of this connection.  The image itself doesn't offer visual evidence supporting or refuting the claim about the decriminalization of looting in California.  A human analyzing the image without additional information would likely find a similarly weak connection.  To establish a stronger link, additional information about the context of the protest depicted in the image would be needed.

The relatively low similarity score of 0.31 from CLIP, despite classifying the image as ""Related"" to the claim ""The Los Angeles wildfires were planned in preparation for the 2028 Olympics,"" suggests a weak connection established by the model.  The connection is likely based on superficial, rather than substantive, similarities.

Here's a breakdown of why the classification might have been made, despite the low score:

* **Keyword Matching:** CLIP likely identified keywords in the claim (""Los Angeles,"" ""wildfires"") and found matches in the image context (visual depiction of a Los Angeles wildfire).  The image itself demonstrates a wildfire in Los Angeles, thus fulfilling a crucial part of the claim, even if it doesn't address the *cause* of the fire (whether it was planned or not).

* **Association with Disaster Response:** The image shows firefighters actively fighting a wildfire, which implicitly connects to the notion of disaster response and preparedness. The 2028 Olympics would naturally necessitate a robust disaster preparedness plan, including wildfire response.  This indirect association, however weak, might contribute to the ""Related"" classification.

* **Lack of Evidence Against the Claim:**  The image itself contains no evidence directly refuting the claim. It doesn't show any signs of arson, planning, or deliberate fire-setting.  The absence of contradictory evidence doesn't strengthen the claim, but it doesn't actively weaken the association either, from a purely visual perspective.

However, what the image *doesn't* show is crucial to understanding the low similarity score:

* **No Evidence of Planning:** There's nothing in the image suggesting the fire was planned.  No suspicious activity, infrastructure related to intentional fire-starting, or anything beyond a typical wildfire response is visible.

* **Absence of Olympic Context:** The image doesn't show any Olympic-related infrastructure, symbols, or preparations.  The connection to the 2028 Olympics is entirely absent from the visual information itself.

In conclusion, CLIP's ""Related"" classification with a low similarity score accurately reflects the weak relationship between the image and the claim. The connection rests solely on the shared keywords ""Los Angeles"" and ""wildfires"" and a loose association between wildfires and disaster preparedness – essential aspects of hosting the Olympics. The image lacks any substantive visual evidence to support the claim of planned wildfires, explaining the low similarity score.  The classification highlights the limitations of relying solely on keyword matching and superficial visual associations when assessing the truthfulness or validity of complex claims.

Diddy's California mansion.  The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.30 reflects a weak connection based on shared visual elements, not factual accuracy.  The low score emphasizes this weak link.

Here's a breakdown of why the classification happened, despite the factual inaccuracy:

* **Shared Visual Concepts:**  Both the claim and the image share the visual concept of a house fire. The image depicts a significant house fire with flames and smoke billowing.  The claim describes a house, specifically a mansion, being completely consumed by fire.  CLIP identifies these shared visual concepts – ""fire,"" ""house,"" ""destruction,"" ""flames"" – and establishes a weak correlation.

* **Lack of Specificity:** The image lacks any identifying information linking the burning house to P. Diddy or a specific location.  There are no visible signs or contextual clues (like address, nameplates, etc.) to indicate the property's ownership. This lack of specificity contributes to the low similarity score.  The claim is highly specific; the image is completely generic.

* **Semantic Gap:** The most significant reason for the low score is the semantic gap between the claim and the image. While both deal with a house fire, the crucial element – the identity of the house and its owner – is entirely missing from the image. CLIP struggles to bridge this significant semantic gap.

* **Similarity Score Interpretation:** The score of 0.30 is relatively low.  In CLIP's scoring system, this suggests a weak or tenuous connection. It indicates that while some visual similarities exist, the overall context and specificity are vastly different.  A higher score would imply stronger visual and contextual alignment.

In conclusion, the ""Related"" classification is driven by the shared visual concept of a house fire. However, the lack of any identifying information in the image and the crucial difference in subject matter (a generic burning house versus P. Diddy's mansion) result in a low similarity score, accurately reflecting the weak connection between the claim and the image.  The model is detecting superficial similarities rather than a factual relationship.

The image, however, shows a damaged house in Hawaii.  The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a low similarity score of 0.25 reflects the tenuous connection between the claim and the image.  This low score indicates a weak relationship.

Here's a breakdown of why the relationship is weak, despite the classification:

* **Location Discrepancy:** The most significant discrepancy is the location. The claim specifies California, while the image clearly depicts a house in Hawaii (indicated by the visual context and likely metadata associated with the image online). This geographical mismatch is a major factor reducing similarity.

* **Time Discrepancy:** The claim mentions January 2025, a future date. The image provides no temporal information; it could be from any time.  The lack of a matching timeframe weakens the connection further.

* **Type of Structure:** While both the claim and the image depict houses, there's nothing specific about the architectural style or size in the claim to definitively match the house in the image.  The house in the image shows significant damage, while the claim emphasizes that the house *remained intact*. This is a stark contrast.

* **Religious Affiliation:** The claim mentions a Catholic family.  The image shows no indication of the residents' religious affiliation.  This element of the claim is entirely absent from the image.

* **The Low Similarity Score:** The 0.25 score from CLIP explicitly signals a weak semantic relationship.  While CLIP might identify common visual elements like ""house,"" ""fire damage"" (to some extent), or ""residential structure,"" the contextual information (location, time, and the specific claim of intactness) significantly outweighs these similarities.  The model likely found some superficial visual overlap but heavily penalized the critical discrepancies in the contextual information.

In conclusion, the ""Related"" classification is likely a result of CLIP identifying the common semantic concept of ""house"" and possibly detecting some level of fire damage. However, the crucial contextual details, especially location and the state of the house (intact vs. damaged), contradict the claim so strongly that the low similarity score accurately reflects the weak relationship.  The classification is more of a loose association than a meaningful connection.

The low score indicates a limited connection.

The image shows a hazy, smoky sky, likely indicating a nearby fire or significant air pollution. This visual element aligns with the claim's assertion of fires.  However, the image lacks any concrete evidence specifically linking the smoke to fires originating in California and impacting Tijuana's Villa del Campo. There are no geographic markers, landmarks, or other visual cues to confirm the location as Tijuana or to pinpoint the source of the smoke to California.

The weak relationship stems from the following:

* **Indirect evidence:** The image only shows smoke/haze, a general indicator of fire or pollution, not direct proof of California fires reaching Tijuana's Villa del Campo.  The smoke could originate from many sources.

* **Lack of specificity:** The claim specifies a location (""entrance of Villa del Campo in the hills""). The image provides no such contextual detail.

* **Ambiguity:**  The haze could be caused by numerous factors besides California wildfires—local fires, industrial pollution, or even naturally occurring atmospheric conditions.

* **CLIP limitations:** CLIP models analyze images and text independently and then measure similarity.  While the image's visual content (smoke) partially overlaps with a key element of the claim (fires), the lack of specific locational or contextual information limits the relationship strength. The model likely recognizes the semantic connection between ""smoke"" and ""fires,"" but struggles with the geographical and specific location components of the claim.

In summary, the CLIP model deemed the image ""Related"" because the visual element of smoke in the image is conceptually linked to the ""fires"" mentioned in the claim.  However, the crucial geographic and specific location details in the claim are entirely absent from the image, resulting in the low similarity score.  The image is suggestive, but not conclusive evidence supporting the claim.

But one video shared widely on social media that claims to show Black men looting items from a home does not show that at all.
A video posted on Instagram Jan. 9 showed a young man in a navy Nike hoodie with what looked like a white, cloth bag slung over his shoulder as he walked down a street away from a muted green home. Flames and smoke rose in the background. The video then cut to images of three other men carrying a big-screen television set out of the same house.
""Fires and looting,"" the post’s caption said. ""A regular Democrat run city. There’s nothing to see here.""
We found multiple social media posts sharing the same video, some on X had a community note attached that said the people in the video were helping a family member, not looting. The note linked to an Instagram video showing a KTLA news reporter interviewing a homeowner.

Using the words on that news report’s chyron — ""Deadly Eaton fire burns 10,600+ acres in San Gabriel Valley"" — we traced the interview using TV Eyes, a media monitoring site, to KTLA’s Jan. 8 live coverage of the fires. We also found that video on KTLA’s YouTube page.
In that video, KTLA reporter Chip Yost said, ""Basically, the folks who live here and their friends emptied this house out of a bunch of their stuff just in case the fire got here,"" as the camera panned across the street to show items, some in white bags, on a sidewalk. Included was a blue, wheeled trash bin, like the one seen in the background of posts claiming to show a looter carrying a white bag.
The camera returned to Yost, who was standing in front of a green home in Altadena that looked like the one seen in the Instagram video and was purportedly looted. He interviewed a woman who said she lived there with her three children.
At one point, the camera panned to the woman’s house, showing a street address of 161. That’s the same house address that showed on the front of the house in the Instagram post that said it showed looting. In the original TV report, a young man wearing a blue hooded sweatshirt and light-colored pants walked out of the house — attire that matched that worn by the person carrying the white bag at the introduction of the Instagram video that claimed it showed looting. ""That’s my son,"" the woman told Yost.

Yost asked about the people who helped her retrieve her belongings. 
""My brothers work for the city of Pasadena,"" she said. The camera panned to a group of men and women standing a few feet away. One man wearing a red sweatshirt and pants, a wool cap and a face mask appears to be the same man seen carrying a TV out of the house in the posts that claimed to show looters.
The KTLA video did not show the men carrying the items out of the home. We contacted KTLA and Yost for comment but an editor there said the team was too busy covering the fires to immediately comment.
Looting has been a real problem during the Los Angeles wildfires. California Attorney General Rob Bonta vowed to hold looters accountable, and Gov. Gavin Newsom deployed the state’s National Guard to aid law enforcement. Officials have arrested multiple people for looting in wildfire-damaged areas, including one man dressed as a firefighter, news reports said.

The classification of ""Related"" with a similarity score of 0.31 to the claim ""Video shows people in Los Angeles looting from homes during wildfires"" is low, reflecting the image's lack of direct evidence supporting the claim.  The relationship is tenuous and based on contextual association rather than direct depiction.

Here's a breakdown of why the score is low and why the classifier might still deem it ""Related"":

* **Lack of People Looting:** The image shows burned-out houses and debris, typical of a wildfire aftermath. Crucially, there are *no* people visible in the image, let alone people engaged in looting.  This is the primary reason for the low similarity score.  The claim speaks specifically about *people looting*, and this is absent from the photograph.

* **Contextual Association:** The classifier likely connects the image to the claim based on the shared context of wildfires in the Los Angeles area.  The image depicts the aftermath of a wildfire, a key element in the claim.  The classifier might infer that given the devastation shown, the conditions might be conducive to looting, even if it doesn't show any actual looting taking place.  This is a weak connection.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The 0.31 score further emphasizes the weak relationship.  This is not a high degree of similarity; it suggests only a loose thematic connection.  A higher score would be expected if the image actually showed people engaging in looting.

* **Absence of Supporting Evidence:** The image lacks any text, symbols, or other visual cues that directly support the claim of looting.  There are no signs of forced entry or stolen property visible.

In summary, the CLIP model's classification is driven by a contextual association between wildfires in the Los Angeles area (as described in the claim) and the image showing wildfire damage in a nearby location.  However, the lack of visual evidence of looting itself results in a low similarity score, correctly indicating that the image does not provide direct support for the claim. The relationship is based on indirect circumstantial evidence, not direct depiction.

But nearly eight years since he left office, some social media users continue to baselessly claim he was born in Kenya. 
A Jan. 5 Threads post is among them: It features an image of what looks like a ""certificate of birth"" from ""Coast Province General Hospital"" in ""Mombasa, British Protectorate of Kenya."" 
The child’s name is ""Barack Hussein Obama II"" and the purported document bears much of the same information as Obama’s authentic birth certificate from his birth at the Kapiolani Maternity & Gynecological Hospital"" in Honolulu, such as the time and date of his birth. 
We previously fact-checked a fabricated birth certificate used to argue Obama was born in Kenya. That document was fake and those claims were false. That’s also true here.

In March 2017, Malik Obama, Obama’s half brother, posted the purported birth certificate on X. 
""Surely. What’s this?"" Malik Obama said. Malik Obama, a vocal supporter of President-elect Donald Trump, is estranged from Barack Obama. 
But as Snopes noted, writing about the X post that year, this was ""a scan of a long-debunked forged document.""
Mombasa, for example, wasn’t part of Kenya when Obama was born; it was part of Zanzibar until December 1963.
Other news outlets have also raised red flags, such as the date given for Obama’s mother’s birth: ""11/29/1942."" Kenya formats its dates day/month/year, as does Great Britain; when Obama was born in 1961, Kenya was still under British rule. 
Unfounded rumors about Obama’s citizenship have circulated since his first presidential run. In June 2008, the Obama campaign responded to those rumors and released a copy of his Hawaii birth certificate, posting the document online. That fueled even more claims, this time that the document was fraudulent.

FactCheck.org reporters went to Chicago, where Obama’s campaign headquarters was based, to hold the document and examine it closely. They concluded that it was legitimate. 
In October 2008, Dr. Chiyome Fukino, then director of the Hawaii Department of Health, issued a statement saying that he and the registrar of vital statistics ""who has the statutory authority to oversee and maintain these types of vital records"" had personally seen and verified that the health department had Obama’s original birth certificate on record. 
Janice Okubo, a health department spokesperson, told us that birth certificates evolve over the decades, and there are surely differences between what Obama’s looked like when he was born and how the documents look today. 
As we’ve reported, if there had been a plot to forge a birth certificate so that Obama could run for office, it would have originated the day he was born. 
Will Hoover, who wrote a 2008 story for the Honolulu Advertiser about Obama’s childhood in Hawaii, told PolitiFact that he reviewed microfilm archives and found two birth announcements for Obama. One was in the Honolulu Advertiser on Aug. 13, 1961, 1961, and the other was in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin the next day. They both said the same thing: ""Mr. and Mrs. Barack H. Obama, 6085 Kalanianaole Highway, son, Aug. 4."" The health department submitted both announcements; not Obama’s family.
""Take a second and think about that,"" PolitiFact reported in 2009. ""In order to phony those notices up, it would have required the complicity of the state Health Department and two independent newspapers — on the off chance this unnamed child might want to one day be president of the United States.""

Without direct access to the original image, analysis relies on the description provided by the archive and the CLIP model's assessment.  Given the claim ""Image shows former President Barack Obama was born in Kenya,"" and a similarity score of 0.28 from CLIP, we can infer the following:

The low similarity score (0.28) strongly suggests the image does *not* directly depict Barack Obama's birth in Kenya.  A high score would indicate a strong visual match to the claim.  A score of 0.28 sits firmly in the realm of weak or no correlation.

The classification as ""Related"" rather than ""Unrelated"" implies that the image contains elements that *indirectly* relate to the claim, possibly through context, association, or subtle visual cues. This could manifest in several ways:

* **Textual Content:** The archived image likely contains text mentioning Obama and Kenya, possibly in a context that promotes the false claim of his Kenyan birth. This text might be a headline, part of an article, or a caption within a social media post.  The text itself is not providing visual proof, but its association with the claim boosts the ""Related"" classification.

* **Visual Representation of Related Concepts:**  The image might contain symbols, logos, or imagery associated with birtherism conspiracy theories or news reports discussing Obama's birthplace. This would be an indirect visual connection, explaining the low similarity score.  For instance, a news headline mentioning the controversy, even without showing Obama directly, could contribute to the ""Related"" classification.

* **Imagery of Kenya:** The image might show Kenyan landscapes, flags, or other imagery related to Kenya. This would be another indirect link. While not showing Obama in Kenya, the imagery might provide a contextual link, making the image somewhat relevant to the claim, albeit weakly.

* **Visuals Related to Disinformation:** The image might show a manipulated or misleading image related to Obama, even if not directly depicting him in Kenya.  This could fall under the ""Related"" classification due to its connection to the spread of misinformation surrounding his birth.


In summary, the low similarity score coupled with the ""Related"" classification indicates that the image likely does *not* offer direct visual evidence supporting the claim.  Instead, the relationship stems from indirect visual and textual elements within the image, associating it with the false claim through context, related concepts, or visual cues related to the broader birtherism conspiracy. The CLIP model is identifying thematic connections rather than a direct visual representation of the claim.  The low score, however, emphasizes the weakness of this connection.

The Threads post follows a trend we’ve seen before: When wildfires engulfed parts of Maui, Hawaii, in August 2023 and Texas in early 2024, some social media users claimed directed energy weapons caused the destruction; PolitiFact rated those claims False. 
Already, we’ve fact-checked a claim that footage Fox News aired Jan. 7 showed directed energy weapons starting the fires in California — that’s False.
Like those false claims, this post about the California wildfires is inaccurate in multiple ways, experts on directed energy weapons and wildfires said. 
Directed energy weapons fire concentrated energy at light speed and might include high-energy lasers and high-power microwave weapons, the federal Government Accountability Office reported.
The weapons wouldn’t spare items from destruction just because they are blue. 
Iain Boyd, an aerospace engineering sciences professor at the University of Colorado Boulder and Director of the Center for National Security Initiatives, has repeatedly told news organizations including The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse that although high-energy lasers might interact differently with items made of different materials or colors, an item of a certain color wouldn’t be immune. 
""If there is enough energy in a laser beam to start a large fire, then it will burn through the material no matter what its color,"" Boyd told Agence France-Presse in 2023. 
Also, whatever items survive a wildfire — whether they’re blue or any other color — do not prove directed energy weapons figured in the catastrophe. Wildfire behavior experts told PolitiFact that when wildfires burn, they don’t leave a uniform pattern of devastation.
""It’s absolutely not surprising that there’s uneven patterns in what we call fire effects,"" said Maureen Kennedy, associate professor in quantitative fire ecology and forest management at the University of Washington, Tacoma. ""Fires are really subject to randomness."" 
Janice Coen, project scientist at the U.S. National Science Foundation’s National Center for Atmospheric Research, said that this varied destruction from wildfires is called the ""fire mosaic.""
""There is nothing inherently suspicious about uneven patterns of damage,"" Coen said. ""Severely burned areas can lie next to untouched areas. One home can be destroyed while the one next to it is untouched."" 
That has happened during the greater Los Angeles fires: CNN interviewed an Altadena, California, resident whose house burned down. A nearby home appeared largely unscathed, however.

Kennedy said that’s largely because sudden wind shifts can redirect heat and determine what combusts and what doesn’t, though she added that factors including moisture differences and topography can also influence fire behavior. 
""In the urban environment, there are differences possibly simply with landscaping and building materials and the proximity to the other fuels,"" she said. ""The lucky house — the one that survived — might have been just far enough from the ones that were burning in the moments that the wind shifted that it was the lucky one to have survived.""
Kennedy expressed no suspicion about the fires being caused by directed energy weapons. 
""These fire events are pretty consistent with our understanding of how fires work in that area,"" she said.
The fires’ causes are so far unknown, but powerful Santa Ana winds and the abnormally dry conditions in Southern California sped the wildfire’s spread. 
Our ruling
A Threads post said, ""blue items that survive"" the California wildfires are ""indicative of DEW's (Directed Energy Weapons).""
Directed energy weapons wouldn’t spare items from destruction just because they are blue, one  expert said. And when wildfires burn, they don’t leave a uniform pattern of total devastation, wildfire science experts told PolitiFact. This means that just because the fires might spare some blue items, it won’t prove that directed energy weapons were involved in the catastrophe.
We rate this claim False.

The claim, however, posits that the survival of blue items after a California wildfire is evidence of directed energy weapons (DEWs).  The low similarity score of 0.28 from CLIP reflects the weak connection between the image and the claim.

Here's a breakdown of why the classification is ""Related"" with a low score:

* **Lack of Blue Items:** The image doesn't prominently feature any blue items, let alone ""surviving"" ones.  The focus is on the fire itself, firefighters, and the damaged house.  The absence of the key element mentioned in the claim significantly weakens the connection.

* **Generic Wildfire Scene:** The image is a generic depiction of a wildfire response. It doesn't show anything unusual or suggestive of directed energy weapon involvement. The destruction is consistent with conventional fire damage. There are no burn patterns or other visual indicators that would support the DEW theory.

* **Focus on Conventional Firefighting:** The image focuses on the actions of firefighters using conventional equipment to fight a fire. This reinforces the idea that the fire is a standard wildfire event, contradicting the claim about DEWs.

* **CLIP's Limitations:** CLIP, like all AI image classifiers, relies on identifying visual patterns and associating them with textual descriptions.  It likely established a weak connection based on the shared concept of ""California wildfires.""  However, it failed to grasp the subtle and unsubstantiated connection proposed in the claim concerning blue objects and DEWs. The low similarity score indicates this weak connection.

In summary, the image depicts a standard wildfire scenario, while the claim is a specific, unsubstantiated allegation about the effects of DEWs.  The low similarity score accurately reflects the weak and tenuous relationship between the visual content and the claim.  The connection lies solely in the general context of California wildfires, without any supporting visual evidence for the claim itself.

The low score reflects the discrepancies between the claim and the image's content.

Let's break down why the classification isn't higher:

* **The Claim:** The claim explicitly states the Hollywood sign is *on fire* on January 8th, 2025.

* **The Image:** The image shows the Hollywood sign in its typical state, **not on fire**.  There is no visible damage, smoke, or flames.  The sign appears intact and illuminated.  The date, while not explicitly shown in the image, is likely to be the date specified in the metadata. Assuming that the date in the metadata is correct (January 9th, 2025), it's only one day off from the date in the claim.

The reason for a *Related* classification, albeit with a low score, likely stems from these factors:

* **Subject Matter:** The image and the claim both feature the Hollywood sign.  This shared subject matter is the primary reason for any connection.  CLIP recognizes the visual representation of the Hollywood sign.

* **Temporal Proximity (weak):** The date in the claim (January 8th, 2025) is very close to the probable date of the image (January 9th, 2025). This temporal proximity might contribute slightly to the model's relationship assessment.  However, this is a minor factor, given the significant difference in the core assertion (fire vs. no fire).

* **Limitations of CLIP:** CLIP is a visual-text model. It doesn't possess ""understanding"" in the human sense.  It identifies patterns and correlations between visual and textual data.  It has connected the Hollywood sign in the image to the mention of the Hollywood sign in the claim, despite the crucial detail of the fire being completely absent in the image.


In summary, the low similarity score reflects the significant factual discrepancy. The image contradicts the claim's assertion about the sign being on fire. The ""Related"" classification is purely based on the shared subject (the Hollywood sign) and a minor temporal overlap, and doesn't indicate a strong or accurate representation of the claim's truthfulness.  A higher score would be expected if the image actually depicted the Hollywood sign ablaze.

But that image is fake. As of Jan. 10, the fires had not reached the Hollywood sign, which sits atop Mount Lee.
According to information from Jeff Zarrinnam, chair of the Hollywood Sign Trust, a nonprofit organization responsible for the sign’s maintenance, the sign was not damaged as of 3 p.m. Jan. 9. The trust said Jan. 10 that there was no new information.
And although the Palisades, Eaton, Kenneth, Hurst, Lidia and Archer fires, all in the greater Los Angeles area, had not been fully contained as of Jan. 10, the Sunset fire, which was near the Hollywood sign, had been 100% contained, according to the Los Angeles Times.

Let's break down why:

The image itself shows the Hollywood sign in daylight, seemingly undamaged and without any visible signs of fire, smoke, or burn marks.  The claim, however, states the sign was *on fire* on January 8th.  These are directly contradictory.

The low similarity score (0.32) reflects this discrepancy.  The model likely identified some level of relevance based on the following weak connections:

* **Presence of the Hollywood Sign:**  The image clearly depicts the Hollywood sign, fulfilling a key element of the claim.  This forms the basis for *some* relationship, albeit a superficial one.
* **Temporal Proximity (potentially):** The filename metadata might contain date information (though this is speculation without seeing the filename metadata directly. The URL suggests a date of Jan. 9th, 2025, which is close to the claimed date of January 8th).  This close temporal proximity could contribute marginally to the model's assessment, suggesting a potential connection even if the claim about the fire is false.  However, this is likely a weak factor.
* **Contextual Understanding (limited):** CLIP models aren't perfect.  They might have some weak understanding of the contextual information –  that fires are often associated with news and images.  The model could be associating ""Hollywood sign"" + ""date"" + image with the general concept of news reporting, even without understanding the specific claim's falsity.

**Why the low score?** The significant discrepancy between the claim (fire) and the image (no fire) overwhelmingly outweighs the weak connections.  The model correctly identifies a mismatch. The low similarity score reflects this significant contradiction, accurately conveying that the image does *not* support the claim.  A higher score would imply a stronger visual correlation between the claim and the image's content, which isn't present here.

The low similarity score reflects the lack of direct evidence.

The image shows a partially visible document, seemingly a school-related communication, with some obscured text.  There's no clear mention of ""masturbation"" or any explicit reference to it.  However, several factors contribute to the model's weak positive association:

* **School Setting:** The visual elements strongly suggest a school environment. The partially visible text, which has a formal, likely official, structure, reinforces this.  CLIP likely recognizes the format as typical for school notices or announcements. This links to the claim's context of a school issuing a notice.

* **Ambiguous Text:** While the text is mostly illegible, the presence of what looks like structured text (possibly headings, bullet points, or paragraphs) adds to the connection.  The model might associate the unseen text content with a potentially sensitive topic, given the nature of the claim (a controversial school notice).  Even without reading the text, the visual cues align with the expected format of a formal school announcement.

* **Contextual Association:** The combination of a school-related document and a claim about a controversial school policy creates a weak, indirect connection. The model's understanding is based on probability and statistical associations learned from its massive training dataset.  It might have seen similar images associated with similar news articles or discussions involving school policies, even without explicit mentions of the specific words in the claim.

Why the score is only 0.31:

The low similarity score directly reflects the lack of explicit visual evidence.  There's no visible mention of ""masturbation,"" ""McQueen High School,"" or ""Nevada."" The image's ambiguity and the partially obscured text significantly limit the confidence level of the association.  The model cannot definitively confirm or deny the claim based solely on this image.  The connection is inferred, not directly observed.

In summary, CLIP's ""Related"" classification stems from a combination of the image's overall context (school-related document) and the claim's general topic (a controversial school notice). However, the lack of concrete visual evidence results in a low similarity score, indicating a weak and indirect relationship.  The image alone is insufficient to corroborate or refute the claim.

And more importantly, we found no evidence to corroborate the claim that Hanks died. Such a death would draw broad media attention. 
But recent news coverage about the actor focuses on his Pacific Palisades home as wildfires level Los Angeles area communities. They don’t mention his purported death.

The headline uses bold, large font and alarming red text to convey urgency. While the exact text isn't fully legible due to the screenshot's resolution and stylistic choices, it clearly references the death of a celebrity – specifically mentioning ""Tom Hanks"" and possibly the words ""car accident.""  The visual elements—the red font, flashing effect, and stylized banner – are all designed to simulate the shock and sensationalism associated with a sudden celebrity death announcement.


The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.36, despite being relatively low, makes sense because it identifies key thematic overlaps between the claim (""Actor Tom Hanks died in a fatal car accident"") and the image.  The image strongly suggests a news report about Tom Hanks' death.  The moderate similarity score (0.36) likely reflects the ambiguity introduced by:

* **Lack of perfect textual match:** The image's text isn't perfectly clear, preventing a perfect semantic match with the precise wording of the claim.  The headline might say something slightly different, even if the core message is the same.
* **Visual Style Over Substance:** The image relies heavily on visual cues to convey its message (the styling is designed for impact, not accuracy).  CLIP might be less confident about its interpretation due to the stylized nature of the visual representation.
* **The possibility of disinformation:**  The entire presentation screams ""fake news"" – the sensationalized style is a hallmark of intentionally misleading articles. CLIP, lacking real-world knowledge about Tom Hanks' current status, cannot definitively determine the veracity of the image's content.  It simply recognizes thematic connections between the image's visual and textual elements and the claim.


In essence, CLIP sees enough commonality between the claim's subject (Tom Hanks) and its premise (death via car accident) and the image's apparent depiction of a news report concerning the same subject and a possible car accident to classify them as ""Related."" The low score reflects the model's uncertainty due to the stylistic aspects and the inherent possibility of the information presented in the image being false.  It’s a connection based on superficial similarities rather than a definitive confirmation of the claim's truthfulness.

This is not a new claim. Besides the ""smart island"" claim about Maui’s wildfires, we have rated similar claims False about wildfires in Canada and Spain’s Canary Islands, noting that installing smart city technologies — which collect information to help cities run more efficiently — would not require destroying existing infrastructure.
California’s Department of Forestry and Fire Protection has reported that the Palisades, Eaton and Hurst fires started Jan. 7 in Southern California. On Jan. 8, the department reported the Woodley, Lidia and Sunset fires had started in Los Angeles County. As of Jan. 9, the Woodley (according to the department’s website) and Sunset (according to NBC News) fires are 100% contained. As of Jan. 9, the Palisades and Eaton fires are zero percent contained while the Lidia fire is 60% contained and the Hurst fire 10% contained.
Although the Los Angeles County Fire Department is still investigating what caused the multiple fires, NBC News reported that the fires were sparked by a combination of dry conditions and powerful winds.
Why the fires weren’t caused for ‘smart cities’ and the UN’s 2030 agenda 
Contrary to the social media claims, the wildfires were not caused to make way for ""smart cities"" and the United Nations’ 2030 agenda. Here’s some background:
In 2015, the United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which, according to its website, includes 17 sustainable development goals to end world poverty, protect the planet and tackle inequalities. 
Among them is Goal 11: ""Make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable,"" which includes what some people have termed  ""smart cities.""
A 2020 United Nations document called People-Smart Sustainable Cities says: 
""The International Telecommunication Union and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe worked together to define a smart sustainable city as ‘an innovative city that uses information and communication technologies and other means to improve quality of life, efficiency of urban operation and services, and competitiveness, while ensuring that it meets the needs of present and future generations with respect to economic, social, environmental as well as cultural aspects.’"" 
But Shoshanna Saxe, an associate professor in the University of Toronto’s Department of Civil & Mineral Engineering, told PolitiFact in 2023 that ""smart cities"" has ""been used so many times that it sort of lost all meaning."" 
Saxe said that cities often use the term to describe simpler things, such as creating a smartphone app for residents to contact the city, or open data platforms to make research and development more accessible. 
""A lot of the stuff people are currently calling their smart-city initiatives are really run of the mill operating a city in the 21st century,"" she said, including using smart electric grids to more efficiently meet energy needs.
PolitiFact found no credible evidence or reports that Los Angeles or other U.S. areas are being destroyed to build smart cities.

Plus, cities don’t need to destroy existing development to apply smart city technology, which mostly involves adding sensors or software to existing infrastructure.
The SmartLA 2028 initiative, which the city’s Information Technology Agency oversees, mentions renovating metro rail and bus systems to improve mobility for residents. (Los Angeles will host the Summer Olympics in 2028.) 
The plan also calls for applying technology to help residents with disabilities and creating technology that detects fire, violence or other health risks before residents call 911. Other goals include increasing internet access speeds and accessibility for underserved communities. Another would equip Los Angeles International Airport’s terminals with ""multi-lingual electronic wayfinding"" during the Olympics and Paralympics. The report doesn’t mention big plans for destroying and rebuilding the city.
Our ruling
A Threads comment suggests Southern California’s raging wildfires ""are a deliberate criminal land grab in preparation for Agenda 2030 and smart cities.""
That isn’t true. 
Officials have not determined the wildfires’ cause, but there’s no credible evidence that they were set intentionally to advance ""smart cities"" or the United Nations 2030 Agenda.
The U.N.’s  agenda includes building sustainable cities as one of its goals. This includes ""smart cities,"" which add technology to improve quality of life, urban operations and service efficiency.
The SmartLA 2028 initiative doesn’t propose rebuilding the city but rather adding technology to improve residents’ lives. 
Also, installing smart city technology in a city would not require intentional destruction of existing infrastructure.

There is no visible text directly supporting or refuting the claim ""California wildfires are a deliberate criminal land grab in preparation for Agenda 2030 and smart cities.""  The connection, therefore, is entirely circumstantial and based on the AI's (CLIP) interpretation of visual association.

The similarity score of 0.29 indicates a weak relationship.  This low score suggests that CLIP doesn't find a strong visual link between the image and the claim.  The image is simply a generic depiction of a wildfire, a common occurrence in California.  The claim, however, is a highly specific and conspiratorial assertion.

CLIP likely classified the image as ""Related"" due to a rudimentary semantic connection:  wildfires are a relevant visual element *when discussing* California wildfires, regardless of the context of the discussion.  The claim mentions California wildfires; the image depicts a California-style wildfire.  This minimal overlap in subject matter is enough for the algorithm to register some level of association, albeit a weak one.  The absence of any explicit visual elements supporting the conspiracy theory (e.g., bulldozers clearing land, smart city infrastructure under construction) strongly limits the strength of the relationship.

In essence, CLIP is making a superficial association based on shared keywords (""California,"" ""wildfires""). It lacks the capacity for critical thinking or fact-checking to understand the inherent disconnect between a generic wildfire image and a complex conspiracy theory.  The low similarity score reflects this limitation.  The relationship is purely visual and thematic, not based on any evidence supporting the conspiracy theory itself.

There have been a lot of different takes on how Trump took the state over Vice President Kamala Harris, but one in particular caught our eye:
""Trump won 18-24 year olds in Wisconsin,"" according to a Dec. 1, 2024, X post from Luc J. Gagnon@LakePoliticsYT.  Gagnon, according to his profile, is a ""progressive Republican"" and ""ballot chaser"" for Turning Point Action and Republican Party of Milwaukee County.
The claim piqued PolitiFact Wisconsin’s interest because four years earlier, in 2020, in Wisconsin, 14% of all votes cast came from young voters, ages 18 to 29. Of these, 58% supported Joe Biden, while 39% backed Donald Trump, according to the CIRCLE, which also estimated that young people turned out at a higher rate in 2020 than in 2016. 
The impact of that demographic, especially youth of color’s support for Biden, was decisive in races across the country, according to the CIRCLE (the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement), which describes itself as a non-partisan, independent research organization focused on youth civic engagement. 
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
In his post, Gagnon included a table showing Trump winning 50% of the 18-to-24-year-old vote in Wisconsin, while Harris received 48%. Gagnon did not provide a source for his figures, and attempts to reach him for comment were not successful. However, a quick Google search finds that the figures originate from a Nov. 19, 2024, CNN exit poll.   
Gagnon’s social media post garnered 80.9K views and 2.1K likes on X. Thus, we are attributing the claim to social media for purposes of this fact check.
Elections experts weigh in 
Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll, noting the figures were from CNN exit polling, pointed out that the post skipped the first age table for Wisconsin voters, which looks at a slightly different demographic: 18-to-29-year-old Wisconsin voters. 
A closer look at that group shows Harris at 49% and Trump at 48%. The post instead goes for the narrower second one, 18-to-24, which indeed had Trump at 50% and Harris at 48%. 
Franklin also pointed out that there is a quite different result from the data provided by AP-Votecast, which is used by Fox News. That data show a strong Harris win among 18-to-29-year-olds — 61% to 38% — but did not provide a breakdown for 18-to-24-year-olds.
""Which of these is ‘right’ is difficult to know,"" Franklin said in an email. ""Exit polls and the AP Votecast, are attempts to capture voter behavior at the moment of the election, but like all polls they are subject to sampling variability and to non-response issues. For small groups of the electorate (9% to 14% in this case in both polls) the potential for both sampling variation and non-response issues is greater than for larger groups."" 
In other words, the smaller the group examined, the greater the margin of error.
NORC is a nonprofit research organization at the University of Chicago that conducts a survey used by the Associated Press and Fox News under the brand AP VoteCast, which debuted in 2018. 
NBC News in explaining how exit polls work, said that since 2003, Edison Research, a firm that specializes in collecting election data, has conducted exit polls on behalf of the National Election Pool. The NEP is a consortium of media networks — ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC News — that pools together resources for one collective vote count and exit poll operation. 
In the coming weeks and months there will be surveys from shortly after the election that are matched to the state voter files to give a measure of people who actually voted in the election, and their survey responses, Franklin said.
Barry C. Burden, University of Wisconsin-Madison political science professor and director of the university’s Elections Research Center, said there is not sufficiently reliable data to conclude which candidate got more votes among young people — or any other age group — in Wisconsin.
""Exit polls such as the one Gagnon references are the most immediate source for understanding how groups voted in the election, so they are widely used to explore voting patterns,"" Burden said in an email. ""But exit polls are known to have systematic errors, especially for estimating vote choices in subgroups such as 18-24 year olds, who make up a small share of the sample and can be a difficult group to survey. There is also a margin of error to consider, as in any other survey. As a result, it is not reasonable to conclude at this point that Trump won over young voters in Wisconsin.""

Burden said more high-quality data analysis will not emerge until early 2025 because it simply takes time to gather data in more scientific surveys or to use official state voter data to estimate how individuals voted.
""At most we can conclude from exit polls that the vote choices of young voters in Wisconsin were probably more evenly divided between the parties than in recent elections,"" Burden said.
What about any non-poll evidence on the matter?
A Wisconsin Public Radio report also noted that Trump made big gains in voting wards around universities, according to data compiled by Marquette University researcher John Johnson. 
For example, WPR said, in four wards around the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, Biden beat Trump by over 1,000 votes in 2020. This year, with over 4,000 votes cast, Harris eked out a mere 77-vote win.
Also, WPR reported, Trump more than doubled his vote count in seven student-populated wards around Marquette University. He diminished Democrats’ winning margin there from 62% to 38%.
Our ruling
A social media post said ""Trump won 18-24 year olds in Wisconsin."" 
A CNN exit poll does indeed show Trump winning that age group over Harris 50% to 48%.  The CNN poll does show that, but the picture is muddier when you look at other polls, slightly wider groups and consider that the polls themselves have a wide margin of error for what amounts to a small slice of the electorate.
Indeed, that same poll shows a different outcome when the demographic range is widened to ages 18 to 29, which shows Harris over Trump 49% to 48%. And looking at AP Votecast figures quoted by Fox News, Harris won 18-to-29-year-old Wisconsin voters at 61% while Trump received 38% of that demographic. 
Elections experts say exit polls are known to have systematic errors, and more time is needed for high-quality data analysis to determine a better understanding of how Wisconsin’s young people voted in the election. 
Still, those polls are the best information we have at this time and the post quoted the poll accurately.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.26, while seemingly weak, is understandable given the context of the claim ""Trump won 18-to-24-year-olds in Wisconsin.""  The low score indicates a weak connection, reflecting the image's limited direct evidence supporting the claim.

Here's a breakdown of why CLIP might have made this connection:

* **Donald Trump's Presence:** The image's central element is Donald Trump, directly linking it to the claim about his electoral performance. The claim refers to Trump's success, and the image shows him in a setting designed to garner support – a campaign rally.

* **Wisconsin Location:** The image caption or metadata (not directly visible in the provided description but likely available to CLIP) likely specifies the location as Mosinee, Wisconsin. This geographical connection to the claim's location reinforces the link, even if indirectly.  The rally location is within Wisconsin, the state the claim refers to.

* **Implied Youth Presence:** While the image doesn't explicitly show 18-to-24-year-olds, campaign rallies often attract a mix of ages, including younger voters. CLIP might infer a potential presence of this demographic group based on the general context of a political rally. This inference is weak, contributing to the low similarity score.

* **Lack of Direct Evidence:** The image doesn't provide any direct evidence of Trump winning this specific age group.  It shows a rally, but it doesn't show voting data, exit polls, or demographic breakdowns of attendees. This lack of direct support significantly lowers the similarity score.

In essence, the connection is based on circumstantial evidence. The image displays a relevant person (Trump) in a relevant location (Wisconsin) during a relevant event (a political rally aimed at securing votes).  However, the absence of visual proof that Trump specifically won over the 18-to-24 demographic in Wisconsin results in a low similarity score.  The relationship is more one of association than direct evidence.  A higher similarity score would require evidence explicitly connecting Trump's success with the specified age group in Wisconsin.

The image from Politifact shows a photograph of a woman, seemingly Amelia Carter, with visible injuries to her face.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.26 suggests a weak connection between the claim and the image.  The low score indicates that the relationship isn't strong, but there is some perceived link. This link is likely based on the following:

* **Amelia Carter's presence:** The image visually depicts a woman who is explicitly identified, either through captioning or metadata (not visible in the provided context), as Amelia Carter. This directly connects the image to the name in the claim.

* **Facial Injuries:** The woman's facial injuries are visible, suggesting a violent event. This aligns with the claim's assertion that a man set her on fire.  The injuries, while not explicitly showing burns, imply a severe incident consistent with the claim's narrative.

However, the low similarity score (0.26) highlights the limitations of the connection. The image doesn't definitively prove the claim:

* **Lack of Context:** The image provides no context about the circumstances of the injuries. It doesn't show a train, a fire, or a perpetrator.  The injuries could have been caused by various other means.

* **Ambiguity of Injuries:** While the injuries suggest violence, they don't specifically show burn marks. They could be consistent with other types of assault.

* **Potential for Misidentification:** While the image is labeled as Amelia Carter, there's always a small chance of misidentification or mislabeling.

In summary, the CLIP model likely establishes the connection based on the presence of Amelia Carter and the suggestion of violent injury.  The low similarity score accurately reflects the lack of concrete visual evidence to support the claim's specific details (being set on fire on a New York train). The connection is tenuous and relies on inference and partial alignment rather than direct visual corroboration.

The image itself is a *graphic depiction* of a car pile-up, not an actual video.  This is a crucial distinction.

Several factors contribute to the low similarity score:

* **Absence of Video Elements:** The image is a static graphic, lacking any of the visual characteristics associated with video, such as motion blur, frame borders, or temporal sequencing.  CLIP is trained on a massive dataset of image-text pairs and readily identifies the difference between still images and video stills.  The claim explicitly mentions a ""video,"" which is fundamentally absent in the provided image.

* **Generic Nature of the Graphic:** The graphic depicts a generic car pile-up. There are no identifying features that specifically place it in Fort Worth, Texas, or on January 1st, 2025.  The cars are nondescript, the background is vague, and there are no visible landmarks, signage, or date/time stamps. CLIP likely recognizes this lack of specific location or temporal information as inconsistent with a claim that locates the event precisely.

* **Style of the Graphic:** The graphic style appears somewhat stylized or even possibly digitally manipulated, rather than a photorealistic representation of an actual accident scene.  This lack of realism further reduces the image's similarity to what one would expect from a video of a real-life pile-up.

* **The ""False"" label:**  Although not directly part of the image's visual content, the Politifact watermark clearly indicates the graphic is associated with a false claim. This contextual information, while not directly processed by the CLIP model itself, reinforces the overall judgment that the image is not a genuine representation of the claimed video.

In summary, the low similarity score reflects the significant mismatch between the claim's description (a video of a specific event at a specific time and place) and the image's content (a generic, static graphic labeled as false and unrelated to the specific event). The CLIP model successfully identifies this fundamental discrepancy.  The image doesn't visually support the claim in any meaningful way.

It depicts a chaotic scene possibly at a subway station or a similar public transport hub.  There's a considerable amount of smoke and indistinct figures amidst a general sense of disarray.  Crucially, **there is no visible text or identifiable individual that could be linked to a person named Amelia Carter, nor any indication of a specific burning incident.**

Given these observations, the CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a low similarity score of 0.26 is understandable, albeit somewhat weakly supported.  The model likely made this association based on a very loose semantic connection:

* **Contextual Keywords:** The model might have identified keywords related to ""subway,"" ""fire,"" ""emergency,"" or ""crowd"" in its analysis of the image. These keywords are semantically related to the claim, ""The subway burning victim's name was Amelia Carter.""  Even though the image doesn't visually confirm any of these elements explicitly, the *potential* for such a scenario is present in the image's depiction of smoke and confusion.

* **Weak Visual Similarity:** The blurry nature of the image and the lack of clear details make visual similarity extremely weak.  There's no chance of facial recognition or any specific identification of a victim.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The 0.26 score reflects the weak connection. It indicates that the relationship between the image and the claim is tenuous and lacks strong supporting evidence. A higher score would imply a stronger visual and semantic link.

In essence, the CLIP model is making a very broad, contextual association, not a specific identification. It's essentially saying that the image *could plausibly depict* a scenario consistent with the claim, but provides no direct evidence supporting it.  The low similarity score reinforces this weak relationship.  The model is likely relying on general concepts associated with the claim, not on any concrete visual evidence within the image itself.  Human observation would likely classify the image as ""unrelated"" based on its lack of specific information.

Kennedy Jr. to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, President-elect Donald Trump is elevating a small but growing segment of the population that distrusts vaccines and spreads or follows misinformation about them. 
Kennedy is a long-time vaccine skeptic who founded the major anti-vaccine group Children’s Health Defense and has repeatedly promoted a debunked theory that vaccines cause autism. 
Although he has recently distanced himself somewhat from this stance, declaring he would not ""take away anybody’s vaccines"" after Trump was elected, his unorthodox views on medicine are raising concern from medical professionals — and some on Capitol Hill. (That includes Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who wrote in a Dec. 13, 2024, statement that ""efforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures are not just uninformed — they’re dangerous,"" and ""anyone seeking the Senate’s consent to serve in the incoming Administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts."" 
Kennedy has an ally, however, in Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., a skeptic of COVID-19 vaccines who has promoted vaccine falsehoods. Johnson said on X that he ""could not be happier"" about Trump tapping Kennedy, and said he hopes to work ""very closely"" with him on exploring issues like vaccine efficacy. 
Asked on WISN Upfront Nov. 17, 2024, about his praise for Kennedy and false claims about vaccines causing autism, Johnson said he wants to look at ""uncorrupted"" science when determining vaccine safety and that people ""need to have the courage to ask what is causing this explosion"" in autism and chronic illness. 
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
In fact, Johnson said, ""There’s never been a placebo-controlled study on childhood vaccines. Not one."" 
Medical experts say he’s wrong on that.  
Vaccine skeptics debate meaning of ‘placebo’
Asked for evidence of his claim, a spokesperson for Johnson sent a tweet from Aaron Siri, an attorney advising Kennedy. Siri shared a chart from the vaccine-skeptical group Informed Consent Action Network showing 17 vaccines that they allege were not licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ""based on a long-term placebo-controlled trial,"" including vaccines for whooping cough; measles, mumps and rubella; HPV; COVID-19 and influenza. 
Johnson’s office also shared an interview Kennedy did on The Joe Rogan Experience in which he recalled an exchange with Dr. Anthony Fauci, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Kennedy claimed he asked Fauci to present him with evidence that vaccines recommended for Americans had been tested in a placebo-controlled study, and that Fauci could not. 
Placebo-controlled trials are considered the gold standard for testing the safety and efficacy of a new vaccine, according to experts from the World Health Organization. The placebo exists to mimic the experience of getting the vaccine so the people receiving it don’t know which group they’re in. 
Some groups that are skeptical of vaccine safety take issue with the definition of a placebo. Dr. Paul Offit, a physician and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, wrote July 1, 2023, on Substack that the Informed Consent Action Network argues that the only true placebos are water and saltwater, ""which isn’t true.""
""Indeed, a wide range of placebos have been used in vaccine trials,"" Offit wrote. ""These placebos might contain buffers, stabilizing agents, emulsifying agents, or adjuvants, like aluminum salts. They might contain sodium citrate, sodium phosphate, sucrose or polysorbate-80 … all meet the FDA criteria for a placebo."" 
For example, RotaTeq, a vaccine for rotavirus, appears on the Informed Consent Action Network chart, which the group says was not licensed based on a placebo-controlled trial. According to the FDA, the placebo in that trial contained sucrose, sodium citrate, sodium phosphate, tissue culture medium and polysorbate 80. 
""When I look at the ICAN report, I’m just wondering whether they’re playing with words a little bit,"" Dr. William Moss, executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health said, using the abbreviation for the Informed Consent Action Network. ""We often think of a placebo as a comparator group … you have one group that receives the vaccine of interest and the other group receives something else."" 
There have been childhood vaccine studies using saltwater placebos  
Still, even using that narrower definition of a placebo — that it’s a simple saltwater solution — Johnson is wrong. 
Here are a selection of childhood vaccines that went through placebo-controlled trials where the placebo used was a saline solution: 
A rotavirus vaccine tested in South African infants and toddlers, as well as adults, between 2016 and 2017 
Four live measles vaccines tested in Israeli children in the 1960s
A human papillomavirus vaccine tested in adolescent boys and girls between 2003 and 2004 in 10 countries across North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia

“Pfizer just released its list of side effects of its COVID-19 vaccine.”
By Sofia Ahmed • January 30, 2025
Thus, it’s factually inaccurate for Johnson to say that there has never been a placebo-controlled study on childhood vaccines. 
Sometimes, new vaccines are tested against old vaccines 
Where else might these claims come from that vaccines haven’t undergone a placebo-controlled trial? 
In some situations, Moss said, the ""comparator group"" may receive a previously approved vaccine that targets the same disease to determine whether a new vaccine performs better (or performs the same, and is cheaper to make).
Why test a new vaccine against an old vaccine and not an inert placebo? 
If a vaccine against a disease already exists and is working, Moss said, it’s unethical to deprive children of it just to conduct a study. Doing so would put them unknowingly at risk of contracting and getting sick from that disease.
In those cases, Moss said, the vaccine given to the comparator group would be a licensed and approved vaccine that ""would have gone through all the hurdles it takes to get to that."" 
Johnson’s claim didn’t get into these details. He simply said there has been ""not one"" placebo-controlled study on childhood vaccines. And he’s wrong on that. 
Claims like these have ""the air of being scientific,"" Moss said. ""My sense is that this is an approach used by, say, RFK Jr., on calling for transparency in the data and more rigorous assessment of vaccines. Those are good things. I don’t think anyone would argue against that. They’re able to kind of twist it as a way to actually undermine vaccines, or at least induce skepticism."" 
Our ruling 
Johnson stated that ""there’s never been a placebo-controlled study on childhood vaccines."" 
Medical experts say the evidence his office provided takes a narrow view of what a placebo is. 
But even by that definition, there have been studies of childhood vaccines that were placebo-controlled.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a low similarity score (0.26) reflects a weak connection between the image and the claim ""There's never been a placebo-controlled study on childhood vaccines.""  The low score indicates that the connection is tenuous and not strongly supported visually.

Here's a breakdown of why the classification is ""Related"" despite the low score:

* **Direct Relevance:** The image depicts a core element of the claim: childhood vaccination.  The image directly shows a procedure central to the discussion of childhood vaccine studies.  This forms the basis of the ""Related"" classification.

* **Lack of Contextual Information:** The image lacks any information about the type of study being conducted.  It doesn't indicate whether this vaccination is part of a placebo-controlled trial or a standard vaccination program.  This absence of crucial contextual information significantly weakens the relationship.  The claim specifically mentions *placebo-controlled* studies, a detail completely absent from the image.

* **Low Similarity Score (0.26):** The low similarity score quantitatively reflects the lack of direct visual evidence supporting the claim. The image simply shows a vaccination; it doesn't visually represent the core concept of a placebo-controlled trial (e.g., a control group, random assignment, blinding). The score indicates that the connection is primarily based on the general subject matter (childhood vaccination) rather than specific visual evidence related to the claim's core assertion.

* **CLIP's Limitations:**  CLIP, like other AI models, relies on visual patterns and associations. It might associate ""child"" + ""vaccine"" with the broader topic of ""childhood vaccines,"" leading to a weak ""Related"" classification even without strong evidence for placebo-controlled studies.  It lacks the ability to understand the nuances of scientific methodology implied in the claim.

In summary, the image is tangentially related to the claim because it shows a child receiving a vaccine. However, it provides no visual evidence to support or refute the claim about the existence of placebo-controlled studies. The low similarity score accurately reflects the weak visual connection, highlighting the limitations of relying solely on image analysis to assess the veracity of scientific claims.  A more comprehensive analysis would require textual data and scientific literature, not just an image.

The post is wrong about cancer and misleading about the drugs’ effectiveness in treating it. Cancer shares some properties with parasites, but it is not a parasite.
Cancer arises from cell mutations in a person’s body; it’s not a separate organism. These  mutations are inherited, develop randomly, or are caused by a person’s environment. A parasite is a separate organism that lives on or in another host organism and derives nutrients from it. 
Cancer shares most of its DNA with the person who has it, with some mutations. Parasites, like roundworms or tapeworms, have a completely different DNA from the host they enter. 
Cancer and parasites both grow or reproduce by drawing resources from the host and can resist the host’s immune responses. 
The post’s claim that ivermectin and other antiparasitics can ""cure"" cancer is also unproven. Neither the FDA nor the World Health Organization have approved ivermectin to treat cancer, but some studies have shown it can slow tumor growth in research settings. 
The Facebook post linked to a study called ""Ivermectin: a multifaceted drug with a potential beyond anti-parasitic therapy,"" published in March in Cureus, an academic journal. The study refers to several other studies that have shown ivermectin may inhibit tumor growth. 
But the Facebook post overstated the drug’s effectiveness. The study it linked to said ""extensive in vivo (live) studies and clinical trials are crucial to translating preclinical observations into therapeutic benefits for humans,"" and it cautioned against self-medicating with ivermectin.

Although some studies have shown ivermectin can slow tumor growth in research settings, it has not been extensively studied in humans. In studies, researchers have written  that more research needs to be done about the drug’s potential role in cancer treatment, and exactly how it could inhibit cancer growth.
Whether the body could tolerate doses of the drug at a high enough level to work is a key question that researchers haven’t determined, one study said. 
None of the studies involved testing the drug on humans, and the authors did not claim the drug should replace chemotherapy or other cancer treatment drugs. 
""These studies are preclinical studies which means they have not gone through the thorough study and testing required to show that they are effective and safe in humans,"" said Skyler Johnson, a radiation oncology professor at the University of Utah’s Huntsman Cancer Institute. 
None of the available research, Johnson added, ""supports the claim that Ivermectin is an effective treatment for cancer.""
Mebendazole and fenbendazole, the other drugs the post mentioned, have also exhibited anticancer properties in early research, but like ivermectin, have not been studied in humans.

The image shows a microscopic view of what appears to be a biological sample, possibly cells or tissues, with various structures stained different colors.  There is no visible text, branding, or other information directly linking it to the mentioned drugs or to cancer research.

The claim asserts that cancer is a parasite and that the listed drugs are effective treatments. The image provides no evidence to support either of these assertions.  The microscopic view, while potentially showing cancerous cells or other biological entities, offers no insight into whether they are parasitic in nature or susceptible to the mentioned anthelmintic drugs (Ivermectin, mebendazole, and fenbendazole).  These drugs are primarily used to treat parasitic worm infestations, not cancer.

Therefore, the low similarity score is appropriate because:

* **No direct visual connection:** The image lacks any visual representation of Ivermectin, mebendazole, fenbendazole, or anything that clearly relates to their application or the concept of cancer being a parasite.
* **Lack of contextual information:**  The image is purely a microscopic view lacking any accompanying text or metadata that might link it to the claim.  It's a purely visual depiction of biological material with no information about its origin, treatment, or relevance to the claim.
* **Inconsistent with the claim's central assertion:** The claim's central argument (cancer is a parasite) is not visually verifiable through this microscopic image.  Even if the image depicted cancerous cells, it would not intrinsically confirm or refute the parasitic nature of cancer.

In short, the image is a generic microscopic view of biological material that is completely unrelated to the specific claim made about the efficacy of certain drugs in treating cancer based on a parasitic theory.  The low similarity score accurately reflects this lack of connection.

The video began with a woman discussing Kenya’s digital ID program. The woman erroneously claimed birth certificates in Kenya will be replaced by digital IDs, which are ""somehow implanted, somewhere on somebody’s body.""

The Gates video, however, is from 2015, and he was not talking about Kenya’s digital ID program. He was discussing medical research on vaccines and genetically modified organisms in Africa. 
Although Kenya’s digital ID program, Maisha Namba, is real, it does not involve physically implanting IDs into babies at birth. 
Kenya has struggled to create a digital ID program, the Center for Financial Inclusion, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, reported in August. Under the current program, the Kenyan government assigns Kenyan citizens nine-digit digital ID numbers, physical ID cards and digital IDs, using biometrics such as fingerprints. The IDs aim to let Kenyans access online government services more easily and better track payments for government services. 
Adult Kenyans can register for the program and newborn babies are issued nine-digit ID numbers at birth. None of the public reporting about the program says it involves implanting babies with physical devices.

Gates’ quote was taken from a 2015 interview with Euractiv, a Brussels news site focused on European policies, about the charitable work he and his then-wife, Melinda Gates, were conducting through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. 
The interviewer asked about the safety of genetically modified organisms in African agriculture. Gates compared genetically modified organism safety with research on vaccine safety. He said genetically modified organisms should not be banned outright. But he also said there should be trials and safety measures to ensure the organisms are safe, as there are for vaccines and medicines.
""The strongest analogy is to medicines, and, is there something to worry about with medicines, that is, might some of them have side effects?"" Gates said. ""Do we need safety testing? And we’re taking things that are genetically modified organisms and we’re injecting them in little kids arms, we just shoot them right into the vein. So, yeah, I think maybe we should have a safety system where we do trials and test things out.""
Although the interview was unrelated to Kenya’s digital ID program, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2023 advised Kenya on its digital ID rollout, Business Daily Africa reported. The foundation supports creating digital public infrastructure in low-income countries, which includes digital IDs, digital payment systems and data exchange systems.

The context provided indicates this photo is related to the claim that ""Bill Gates will be implanting digital IDs in newborns in Kenya.""  A similarity score of 0.30 from CLIP suggests a weak, but non-negligible, relationship. Let's analyze why CLIP might have made this classification:

The relatively low similarity score indicates that the connection isn't strong. The image doesn't directly depict the act of implanting digital IDs. However, CLIP's classification likely stems from several factors:

* **Bill Gates' presence:** The image prominently features Bill Gates.  The claim directly mentions him.  CLIP likely recognizes his face and connects it to the claim's subject.  This forms the primary basis for the relationship.

* **The Kenyan setting:** The context provided indicates the location is Kenya. This aligns with the claim's geographical context.  The visual cues in the image, while not definitive (requiring knowledge of the location), likely contribute to the association, albeit weakly.  The clothing and background could subtly suggest a Kenyan setting to the model.

* **Association with philanthropy:**  Bill Gates is strongly associated with philanthropic work, particularly through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.  This foundation often engages in health initiatives in developing countries.  CLIP might implicitly connect this general association (philanthropy in Africa) to the misleading claim of mandatory ID implantation, establishing a tenuous link. The act of shaking hands, often associated with collaborative efforts, could reinforce this perception.

* **Lack of contradictory information:** The image doesn't actively contradict the claim. It doesn't depict anything explicitly refuting the false claim.  The absence of counterevidence might contribute to a weak positive association.

However, the low similarity score (0.30) reflects the image's lack of direct visual evidence supporting the claim.  The image simply shows a handshake – a common interaction that carries no inherent implication of forced digital ID implantation.  The connection made by CLIP is primarily based on the presence of Bill Gates in a Kenyan context, relying on implicit and potentially spurious associations rather than direct visual proof.  A higher score would require the image to show some element related to digital IDs, newborns, or the act of implantation itself, none of which are present.

"Kathy Hochul
stated on November 19, 2024 in a public event:","We’ve created 732,000 jobs since I've been governor.","stated on November 19, 2024 in a public event:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/dec/26/kathy-hochul/job-growth-on-hochuls-watch-helped-by-pandemic-rec/,,"Gov. Hochul returned to her Buffalo roots when she recently cited steady job growth on her watch.
""I grew up in a tough neighborhood,"" Hochul told business leaders at an event hosted by the Partnership for New York City and Crain’s New York Business. ""You know, I've come from the streets of Buffalo and Lackawanna Steel Plant, and Dad worked in a steel plant. My parents lived in a trailer park. So, I've seen how tough it is out there. I know what people are going through, because people that my parents lived next door to still live in that same trailer park years later, the families. People have not escaped, and my job is to help them by creating more jobs with all of you. We've created 732,000 jobs since I've been governor.""
Is Hochul right? Have 732,000 jobs have been created since she became governor in late summer 2021?
Hochul’s staff told us they determined that 732,000 new jobs have been created by comparing private sector job data, which is seasonally adjusted, from August 2021, the month that Hochul was sworn in, with data from July 2024. In August 2021, there were 7,669,100 private sector jobs in New York state. In July 2024, there were 8,401,500 jobs. That's a difference of 732,400 jobs. These figures are available from the state Labor Department and are collected through a survey of payrolls in cooperation with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Hochul’s staff told PolitiFact the July data she relied upon to make her claim was ""current at the time of the event."" But Hochul spoke Nov. 19, and datasets from August, September and October were available. When asked about the newer data, the governor’s staff said that her figure represents a picture of the governor’s first full three years in office.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
Seasonally adjusted data shows that private sector jobs have fallen consistently, if modestly, since July. In August, the number of jobs fell by 8,100 from July. In September, the number of jobs fell again by 2,900. And in October, they fell by 800. The October data was released five days before Hochul’s statement.
Comparing the data from the month when she took office, August 2021, with the most recent data available, preliminary data from October 2024, when private sector jobs totaled 8,391,200, the result is an increase of 722,100 jobs, or nearly 10,000 fewer than she claimed.
Although that is a lower figure, the difference represents 0.1% of the state’s private sector employment. That could be covered by the data’s margin of error.
The survey data for the Current Employment Statistics program counts people who are employed during any part of their pay period on the 12th of every month, and this data set reflects the most up-to-date information when Hochul took office Aug. 24, 2021. The data does not include independent contractors.
Another way to look at the job figures is to take all of the nonfarm jobs, not just private sector jobs. (Farm jobs are not counted in this data set because their numbers can be volatile, depending on the weather and other factors.) From August 2021 to October 2024, nonfarm jobs, seasonally adjusted, increased by 784,500. (In October there were 9,871,100 jobs and in August 2021 there were 9,086,600.)
Seasonally adjusted data can typically provide a better comparison between different months from different years, Bureau of Labor Statistics economist Bruce Bergman said.
A governor has debatable influence over the economy and job creation, especially after a global pandemic. Hochul took office as New York and the nation were recovering from deep job losses because of the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and growth was trending upward.
""You’ll see that big upswing in the data,"" said Scott Laing, clinical assistant professor of finance at the School of Management at the University at Buffalo. The month-to-month changes are flatter now, he said.

New York ranks 11th among states in job growth from August 2021 to September 2024, according to Laing’s analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Nevada and Texas topped the list.
Hochul prefaced her remarks by talking about a troubled economy in western New York, but the recovery between July 2019 and July 2024 happened downstate, according to an analysis of nonseasonally adjusted data by E.J. McMahon, an adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute and a longtime conservative observer of state economics.
""All of the state’s job recovery, and then some, has been concentrated in New York City,"" McMahon said. ""And upstate, as of July, still had not recovered to its July 2019 level."" 
Our ruling
  Hochul ignored the latest monthly jobs reports when she said 732,000 jobs had been created during her administration. Accounting for the three more recent reports shows a slightly smaller increase of 722,000 jobs.
But that difference is minimal given the total number of private sector jobs, and falls within the data’s margin of error.
When counting all nonfarm jobs — not just private sector jobs — the job growth exceeded her statement, with 784,500 new jobs between August 2021 and October 2024.

We rate it Mostly True.",TRUE,image_146.jpg,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/Hochul_Biz_Chat_11.19.24/48ee98a523e236bace42768d20df1b56.jpg,Unrelated,0.2130501419305801,"The CLIP model's classification of the image as ""Unrelated"" with a low similarity score (0.21) to the claim ""We’ve created 732,000 jobs since I've been governor"" is justified because the image provides no visual evidence supporting or refuting the claim.  The image, judging by the provided description (without directly viewing it), likely shows a generic scene, perhaps a press conference or business meeting, featuring Governor Hochul (likely) and other individuals.

Here's a breakdown of why the low similarity score is expected:

* **Lack of Job-Related Visuals:** The image likely doesn't depict any tangible evidence of job creation.  There are no visible construction sites, factories, new businesses opening, or people being hired.  The image is probably just a staged photo of a political event.

* **Abstract Nature of the Claim:** The claim itself is about a statistical figure – 732,000 jobs.  This is an abstract concept not easily visually represented.  A photograph can't directly show this number of jobs.

* **Generic Setting:** A generic political setting, even with the governor present, is not inherently linked to job creation.  Many political events occur without any direct relation to economic statistics.

* **No Supporting Text or Graphics:**  The image probably lacks any text or graphics that explicitly mention job creation or the number 732,000.  Even if there were text, unless it was a verified statistic from a credible source, CLIP might still find it unrelated due to its lack of direct connection to the quantitative claim.


In essence, the image is likely a contextually relevant photo of Governor Hochul, but it offers no visual proof of the job creation claim.  CLIP, trained to identify visual connections, correctly assesses the lack of direct visual correlation between the image and the numerical claim, resulting in a low similarity score and an ""Unrelated"" classification.  The image is potentially relevant as context, but not as evidence for the claim itself.

A reward is provided when a tip ""leads to an arrest and indictment,"" the New York Police Department Crime Stoppers website says. The police foundation decides the reward amount based on committee review. 
People who call in to the Crime Stoppers tipline receive a reference number; the department does not save their contact information. Tipsters can follow up on the information after one week. 
As to whether Shapiro received donations from UnitedHealthcare, its parent company, UnitedHealth Group, reported a $10,000 contribution in 2023.

The image is purely a depiction of a police interaction with an individual.  It provides no contextual information connecting it to the claim about the tipster's ineligibility for reward money due to contacting 911 instead of a designated tip line.  The subject matter is completely different.  The claim relates to a specific crime, a specific reward system, and a specific legal/procedural issue regarding a tip. The image, on the other hand, offers a generic depiction of a law enforcement event with no discernible connection to those specifics.

Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-Calif., criticized a push for mass cuts in federal spending by the Department of Government Efficiency, an incoming presidential advisory committee run by entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. Musk urged lawmakers to vote against a 1,500-plus page ""continuing resolution"" that would keep the government open. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., had negotiated the plan with House Democrats, whose votes he needed to pass it.
Ramaswamy described the bill as ""full of excessive spending"" and said it ""should fail."" President-elect Donald Trump and JD Vance, the vice president-elect, rejected the spending deal that would fund the government through mid-March.
""Maybe someone should tell DOGE that government shutdowns aren’t efficient or cost effective?"" Jacobs wrote Dec. 18 on X, using the committee’s self-chosen abbreviation. ""The 2013 and 2018 ones (again led by House Republicans) cost our economy billions of dollars each.""
In a video, Jacobs added that a government shutdown wouldn’t hurt Musk and Trump, both billionaires, as it would ""everyday Americans.""
Government analyses and outside experts say Jacobs has a point that shutdowns can cost the economy, often measured in gross domestic product, billions of dollars. (Gross domestic product is the total monetary value of all goods and services a country produces.)
""Typically there is a shifting of activity across time and an overall loss of GDP in the single digit billions,"" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a center-right think tank. He cautioned, however, that even a shutdown that costs billions of dollars is modest in the context of a $27 trillion-plus U.S. economy. 
How much have past shutdowns cost?
Congress has until late Dec. 20 to pass a bill that President Joe Biden would sign before 12:01 a.m. Dec. 21 to avoid a shutdown.
Workers across the country would feel a shutdown’s effects. About 85% of federal workers are based outside the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area.
Shutdowns vary in scope and length, and calculating the cost of any particular shutdown is complicated. But government and private analysts have previously estimated that shutdowns hurt the economy.
""Government shutdowns decrease government spending, so these goods and services cannot be provided, directly decreasing output,"" the Congressional Research Service wrote in 2023. 
Shutdowns primarily affect discretionary spending, which accounts for about 27% of total federal spending. Shutdowns do not generally affect mandatory spending, such as Social Security, Medicare and interest payments on the national debt.
Shutdowns also have indirect economic effects, notably federal workers reducing their own spending because they aren’t receiving their paychecks. Although federal workers are paid retroactively, a cash crunch at Christmastime could dampen retail sales and complicate travel.
Steve Ellis, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan group that tracks the federal budget, told PolitiFact, ""Everyone agrees that shutdowns hurt the economy and taxpayers.""
He cautioned, however, that a hit in one quarter can be partially made up in a later quarter. 
""The federal government is going to spend that money, the work is going to get done,"" Ellis said. But he added that ""it won’t be as efficient, so shutdowns are always a waste of money and time.""
A Jacobs spokesperson pointed to several data points, including a Congressional Budget Office estimate that the five-week partial government shutdown in 2018-19 reduced economic output by $11 billion during the following two quarters, including $3 billion that the U.S. economy never regained.
Jacobs’ office also cited a government report that said the cost of pay for furloughed workers was $2 billion. Moody’s Analytics said the 16-day full-government shutdown in October 2013 reduced U.S. GDP growth by $20 billion.

The image shows a news conference featuring a person (presumably a politician given the setting) speaking at a podium.  There's nothing in the image directly related to the economic consequences of government shutdowns.

Here's a breakdown of why the low similarity score is appropriate:

* **Absence of Relevant Visual Cues:** The image lacks any visual elements that would directly suggest economic hardship or the effects of government shutdowns. There are no graphs depicting economic losses, no visuals of empty offices due to furloughs, no protests related to government inaction, no mentions of specific dollar amounts, and no imagery connected to the years 2013 or 2018.

* **Generic Context:** The image is a fairly generic photograph of a press conference.  Such events happen frequently, and they don't inherently relate to any specific policy event like a government shutdown. The setting is a typical press conference room—neutral and lacking specific information.

* **Textual Absence:**  While there might be text on the podium or behind the speaker, it's unreadable in the provided image.  Even if the text were readable, it's unlikely to directly address the economic impact of government shutdowns in 2013 and 2018 without explicit mention.

* **CLIP's Focus:** CLIP excels at identifying visual similarities between an image and text.  Since the image contains no visual elements that directly or indirectly support the claim about the economic cost of government shutdowns, the low similarity score is a logical output.  The connection between the image and the claim is entirely contextual and not visually apparent.

In short, the image is simply a photograph of a press conference; it provides no visual information that would support or refute the claim regarding the economic impact of specific government shutdowns. The low similarity score accurately reflects this lack of visual connection.

As we’ve reported, the ivermectin debate has persisted since the pandemic started, but there’s no conclusive evidence that the drug effectively treats COVID-19.
The FDA has approved ivermectin’s use in treating humans with certain parasitic infections, such as pediculosis caused by head or body lice, or skin conditions, such as rosacea. The agency urges people to take the drug only as prescribed by a health care provider.
A large clinical trial published in 2022 in the New England Journal of Medicine found that ivermectin did not decrease either hospitalizations or prolonged emergency room stays among COVID-19 patients.

The visible text mentions ""ivermectin"" and discusses its use in relation to COVID-19.  While the full context is unavailable, the snippet strongly suggests a discussion of ivermectin's efficacy as a treatment *for* COVID-19, both after infection and after vaccination.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.30 reflects a weak to moderate association between the image and the claim. The low similarity score indicates the relationship isn't strong. This is likely because:

* **Lack of complete textual context:** The image only shows a fragment of the text. The full article might contain information that either supports or contradicts the claim, affecting the overall relevance.  The visible portion only hints at the discussion of ivermectin and COVID-19, without explicitly endorsing or refuting the claim's specific phrasing regarding all phases of the illness.

* **Ambiguity of the textual context:** The visible text doesn't definitively state that ivermectin is *effective*.  It merely implies a discussion of its use in the context of COVID-19.  The claim, however, makes a strong assertion of efficacy in *all* phases.  This difference in the strength of the assertion contributes to the lower similarity score.

* **Visual elements are minimal:** The image itself contains no visual elements that strongly support or refute the claim. The visual information provides little beyond the textual snippet.

* **CLIP's limitations:** CLIP, like all AI models, is not perfect.  Its interpretation relies on its training data and may not fully capture the nuanced relationship between the claim and the incomplete information presented in the image. The score of 0.30 suggests a connection but highlights the model's uncertainty or lack of strong evidence to definitively classify it as highly related.


In summary, the relationship is deemed ""Related"" because the image contains textual fragments directly mentioning ""ivermectin"" and COVID-19, aligning with the claim's subject matter.  However, the low similarity score stems from the incomplete and ambiguous nature of the image's content and the difference in the strength of the assertion about ivermectin's efficacy between the image and the claim. The image provides insufficient evidence to strongly support or refute the claim.

A new one we saw: That the drones may be part of an intensive search for missing radioactive material.
A Dec. 16 Instagram post cited a report filed with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission about radioactive material that was ""lost in transit"" Dec. 2 in New Jersey.
""Could this be the reason for all of the mysterious ‘drones’ that have been seen flying around NJ air space?"" the post asked.
The Instagram post gave a hat tip for the information to an X account that posted Dec. 15 in all caps: ""#BREAKING: U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION ALERTS

RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL IS MISSING."" That post, which had more than 3.6 million views by Dec. 18, included a screenshot of a report filed with the commission. The X post did not mention drones, but said, ""Do you realize what they are doing??""
We found other social media posts making claims connecting the report to the drone sightings. One Instagram post said, ""Military drones are sniffing for spill site.""
The claims also spread among lawmakers. A group of Staten Island, New York, elected officials wrote a letter to the Department of Homeland Security asking whether there was a connection between the drones and the missing material report. New Jersey’s Belleville Mayor Michael Melham also speculated in a local TV interview that the two events might be linked.
The Instagram posts were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.) 
We contacted the Department of Homeland Security for comment and received no immediate response. But our reporting found that these social media posts heightened fear by ignoring key facts about missing radioactive material and mysterious drones.
(Screenshot from Instagram)
New Jersey drone sightings began Nov. 18, two weeks before a small amount of radioactive material was reported missing in the state. New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection spokesperson Caryn Shinske said the missing material was found Dec. 10. That’s several days before social media posts appeared saying that the drones were looking for it.
A Nuclear Regulatory Commision report, shared in some of the social media posts, said New Jersey’s Nazha Cancer Center had reported that ""a Ge-68 pin source that they sent for disposal has been lost in transit"" Dec. 2. ""The source is a Eckert & Ziegler model HEGL-0132, with current approximate activity of 0.267 mCi. The shipping container arrived at its destination damaged and empty,"" the report said.
The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection reported the incident to the commission as required by federal law.
The report said the missing item contained a ""less than Cat 3 level of radioactive material,"" which it defined as ""very unlikely to cause permanent injury to individuals or contain a very small amount of radioactive material that would not cause any permanent injury.""
The Ge-68 pin source is a small piece of radioisotope used to calibrate positron emission tomography (known as PET) scanners, and to generate isotopes used in nuclear medicine diagnostic studies, Shinske said.
PET scans generate 3D images and can detect early signs of cancer and heart and brain conditions, the Cleveland Clinic said.
The pin source contains ""a very low-level radiation source that is approved for shipping through common carriers like FedEx,"" Shinske said.

""The radioactive source — about 6 inches in length and with a 1.5-millimeter diameter — has been located, repackaged, and sent to the manufacturer from the FedEx shipping facility where it was misplaced,"" Shinske wrote in a Dec. 17 email to PolitiFact. No drones were used in the search, she said.
When the state is notified of a lost or stolen radioactive source, the department’s Radiation Protection Element staff communicates with the carrier, FedEx, ""until the material is recovered,"" Shinske said. 
In an ABC News interview, Dr. James Dalzell, a radiation oncologist at the Nazha Cancer Center, also said the missing material had been found and delivered to the manufacturer for disposal. Dalzell said the item’s radiation level was low and that safe shipping required only plastic foam packing.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesperson Neil Sheehan said ""the level of radioactivity associated with the (Ge-68 pin) source is considered relatively low, but it is nonetheless kept shielded when not in use for the protection of workers and the public.""
A Dec. 18 agency update shows the missing pin source was found and the incident was closed.
A spokesperson for the National Nuclear Security Administration, part of the U.S. Energy Department, told PolitiFact in an email that its Nuclear Emergency Support team does not use drones for nuclear or radiological detection missions, and is not currently conducting aerial operations in the New Jersey region.
Drone sightings have caused concern among residents and some legislators, but White House National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby said Dec. 16 that the New Jersey drone sightings are a combination of lawful commercial, hobbyist and law enforcement drones and fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters and even stars mistaken for drones. Kirby’s comments were echoed in a Dec. 17 joint statement by the Department of Homeland Security, FBI, Federal Aviation Administration and the Defense Department.
""We have not identified anything anomalous or any national security or public safety risk over the civilian airspace in New Jersey or other states in the Northeast,"" Kirby said. He did not mention drones being used to search for missing radioactive materials.
Our ruling
Social media posts said a federal agency report about missing radioactive material in New Jersey explains the mysterious drones spotted in the Northeast in recent weeks.
But the drone sightings began two weeks before a small amount of radioactive material went missing. And the material had been found several days before the social media posts were published.
We rate the claims False.",FALSE,image_153.jpg,https://static.politifact.com/politifact/photos/radioactivescreenshot.jpeg.png,Unrelated,0.2453506588935852,"The CLIP model's classification of the image as ""Unrelated"" with a similarity score of 0.25 to the claim ""New Jersey drones are searching for missing radioactive material"" is highly justified based on the image content.  The image shows a screenshot of a news article headline that reads ""NJ man admits to stealing radioactive material, selling it.""  This is significantly different from the claim.

Here's a breakdown of why the low similarity score is appropriate:

* **Subject Difference:** The claim focuses on an *ongoing search* involving drones. The image depicts a *completed crime* and the subsequent confession of the perpetrator. The actions described are completely different – a search versus an arrest/confession.

* **Absence of Drones:** The claim explicitly mentions drones. The image contains no visual representation of drones or any aerial search activity.

* **Focus on the Perpetrator:** The headline and the likely article content (inferred from the visible headline) center around the individual who stole and sold the radioactive material.  The claim focuses on the recovery efforts.

* **Lack of Contextual Connection:**  While both involve radioactive material in New Jersey, the connection is superficial and indirect. The image doesn't show any information about the search efforts, the location of the missing material, or the use of technology like drones in the recovery.

* **Low Semantic Similarity:** CLIP assesses semantic similarity – the meaning and relationship between concepts.  The concepts of ""ongoing drone search"" and ""past confession of theft"" are quite distinct.  The only shared element, radioactive material in New Jersey, is too weak to create a high similarity score, especially given the significant differences in the actions described.

In short, the image describes a completed crime; the claim describes an active search and rescue operation.  These are distinct events, only loosely connected by the shared element of radioactive material in New Jersey. The low similarity score accurately reflects this lack of strong semantic relationship.

The image, which shows a damaged car seemingly involved in a road accident, contains absolutely no elements associated with a drone crash.

Here's a breakdown of why the low similarity score is appropriate:

* **Absence of a Drone:** The most crucial reason is the complete lack of any visible drone or drone wreckage. There are no discernible parts of a drone, such as propellers, a frame, or a camera, present in the image.

* **Road Accident Scene:** The image clearly depicts a car accident scene.  The focus is on a damaged vehicle, suggesting a collision.  There are no indications of a drone being involved in the incident, such as impact marks or debris that would be consistent with a drone falling from the sky.

* **Contextual Dissonance:** The scene is entirely terrestrial and associated with a typical road accident.  The context provided by the image strongly contradicts the claim of a drone crash.  There are no features indicative of an aerial event.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The score of 0.19 reflects the significant difference between the image content and the claim.  A score closer to 1 would indicate a strong visual match.  0.19 suggests a minimal overlap in visual features, which accurately represents the lack of any connection between the image and the claim.

In summary, the CLIP model's classification is accurate.  The image shows a car accident, not a drone crash.  The lack of any drone-related elements and the clear depiction of a road accident justify the ""Unrelated"" classification and the low similarity score.

Here's a breakdown of why the image is unrelated to the claim:

* **Lack of any relevant elements:** The image shows a street, houses, trees, and possibly some cars—none of which are suggestive of a crime scene, police activity, or anything related to a serial killer investigation. There are no visible signs of violence, disturbances, or anything out of the ordinary.

* **Absence of textual clues:** There's no visible text in the image that mentions a serial killer, a warning, or any relevant information.  Even subtle clues like news headlines or police tape are absent.

* **Generic nature of the scene:** The scene is incredibly generic and could be from almost any residential area.  This lack of specificity makes it impossible to link it to a particular city or an ongoing investigation.

* **Low visual complexity:** The image lacks the visual cues typically associated with crime news, such as emergency vehicles, police officers, crime scene tape, or distraught individuals.

* **CLIP's focus on visual semantics:** CLIP excels at matching textual descriptions with corresponding visual features.  Since the image contains no visual features related to the claim's theme of a serial killer on the run (e.g., crime scene, police presence, distressed citizens), the similarity score remains extremely low.

In summary, the image is a completely innocuous depiction of a residential street. It lacks any visual or textual elements that would connect it to the claim about a serial killer.  The low similarity score accurately reflects the absence of any relevant connection between the image and the text.  The CLIP model's classification is therefore accurate and well-justified.

There's no clear, identifiable drone present.  The ""Related"" classification with a low similarity score of 0.25 from CLIP is entirely understandable given this ambiguity.

Here's a breakdown of why the classification is weak:

* **Lack of Clear Drone Identification:** The image lacks any definitive visual features of a downed drone. There are no recognizable components like propellers, a camera housing, or a distinct frame. The objects are too indistinct to confidently identify as parts of a drone.

* **Low Resolution and Blur:** The poor image quality significantly hinders any identification. The blur obscures detail, making it impossible to discern the nature of the objects. This ambiguity heavily impacts CLIP's ability to make a strong association with ""downed drone.""

* **Ambiguous Debris:** The scattered objects could be anything – pieces of plastic, wreckage from a different device, or simply natural debris.  The image provides no context to suggest a drone-related incident.

* **Absence of Contextual Clues:** There are no identifying features in the surrounding environment (e.g., a battlefield, a crash site) to lend credence to the claim. The lack of context further weakens the relationship between the image and the claim.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The 0.25 similarity score explicitly indicates a weak relationship.  CLIP's confidence in associating the image with a ""downed drone"" is extremely low. This score reflects the lack of strong visual evidence supporting the claim.

In conclusion, the ""Related"" classification is based on a very weak association.  The image's poor quality and lack of clear drone components mean that the claim ""Photo shows a downed drone"" is highly speculative at best. The low similarity score reflects CLIP's accurate assessment of the limited visual evidence supporting this claim. The model likely picked up on some vaguely drone-like shapes within the debris, triggering a weak positive association, but not enough to confidently classify it as such.

Let's break down why:

The image shows a young man, clearly identifiable as male, wearing a tie.  This is the only consistent element with the claim.  However, the claim states the image depicts Natalie Rupnow, a female.  This fundamental mismatch in gender is the primary reason for the low similarity score and the ""Unrelated"" classification.

Further reinforcing the ""Unrelated"" classification are several other factors:

* **Absence of identifying features:** The image lacks any features that would suggest a connection to Natalie Rupnow, such as specific clothing, hairstyle, or background that might be associated with her.  The image is generic and doesn't provide any specific details linking the individual depicted to a school shooting or to Natalie Rupnow in particular.

* **Low image quality:** The low resolution of the image may also have contributed to the low similarity score.  CLIP relies on visual features to make comparisons; a low-quality image limits the number of clear visual details available for analysis. This makes it harder to identify any potential, even subtle, resemblances.

* **Contextual mismatch:** The claim introduces a high level of context (school shooter, specific individual) that is entirely absent from the image.  The image is merely a portrait of a young man in a tie. There's no context provided within the image itself to link it to a crime or specific person.


In summary, the CLIP model correctly assessed that the image is unrelated to the claim. The fundamental mismatch in gender, the lack of identifying features connecting the individual to Natalie Rupnow, the low image quality, and the absence of any contextual information linking the image to the claim all contribute to the low similarity score and the accurate ""Unrelated"" classification.  The claim is a blatant falsehood easily debunked by simply observing the image.

In a Dec. 16 email, a  Defense Department spokesperson told PolitiFact that the Pentagon did not confirm that the reported sightings were not of earthly origin.
Social media claims that the Pentagon confirmed that the drones were extraterrestrial distort what a spokesperson said. We rate those claims Pants on Fire!",FALSE,image_158.jpg,https://static.politifact.com/politifact/photos/pentagonscreenshot.jpeg.png,Related,0.2988662123680115,"The image provided is a screenshot of a PolitiFact article debunking a claim about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs), often referred to as UFOs.  The similarity score of 0.30 between the image and the claim ""The Pentagon has confirmed that the mysterious drones appearing across the globe are NOT of earthly origin"" is relatively low, indicating a weak relationship.  Let's break down why CLIP might still classify them as 'Related,' albeit weakly:

**Reasons for a weak 'Related' classification (score 0.30):**

* **Partial Match of Claim Elements:** The claim mentions ""Pentagon,"" ""confirmed,"" ""mysterious drones,"" and ""not of earthly origin."" The image, while not directly showing a confirmation statement from the Pentagon stating *exactly* those words, displays a PolitiFact article addressing the very topic of Pentagon investigations into UAPs. This partial overlap of keywords and subject matter contributes to the weak positive correlation.  The image's text refers to UAPs, which are often described as ""mysterious drones"" in popular discourse, further strengthening this weak link.

* **Contextual Relevance:** CLIP likely understands the context surrounding the claim.  Claims about the Pentagon confirming extraterrestrial origins are frequently associated with news articles and fact-checks, just like the image depicts.  This broader contextual relationship influences the classification even if the exact wording doesn't match.

* **Image Content Limitations:** The image itself doesn't directly show definitive evidence supporting or refuting the claim. It's merely a visual representation of a news article's headline.  The lack of visual proof directly linked to the claim limits the strength of the relationship.  CLIP is reliant on the text within the image as well as its association with news articles.

* **Ambiguity of ""Drones"":** The claim uses ""drones,"" implying a specific type of UAP. The image's text is more general, likely covering a wider range of UAP sightings, not just drone-like objects. This discrepancy reduces the similarity.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The score of 0.30 itself strongly suggests a weak relationship.  It means there's only a limited overlap between the visual and textual information in the image and the explicit wording of the claim.  A higher score would indicate a stronger visual and textual match.


In summary, CLIP's 'Related' classification stems from a partial thematic overlap between the claim and the image's content.  The image shows a news article about a topic closely related to the claim, but the lack of direct visual evidence and the slightly different wording significantly weaken the association, resulting in a low similarity score.  The classification highlights a general subject matter connection rather than a precise match between the claim's specifics and the image's content.

The tweet itself doesn't directly mention running for governor of California.  Therefore, the relatively low similarity score of 0.31 is understandable.  CLIP's ""Related"" classification is likely due to the following factors:

* **Elon Musk's presence:** The most significant factor is the clear presence of Elon Musk's name and profile picture. The claim directly references Elon Musk.  Simply seeing his name and image increases the likelihood of the image being deemed related to anything concerning him, even tangentially.

* **Contextual association (weak):**  The tweet's content might contain keywords or themes that, while not explicitly mentioning the gubernatorial run, could be vaguely associated with California politics or leadership.  Without seeing the actual tweet text clearly in the image (due to resolution and compression), we can only speculate. It's possible the tweet discusses California-related issues that indirectly connect to the claim.

* **Limited textual information:** The low resolution and compression artifacts obscure much of the tweet's text.  CLIP relies heavily on visual and textual information.  The lack of clear, readable text severely limits its ability to make a strong connection between the image and the claim.  A clearer image would likely result in a higher similarity score, if the tweet content supported the claim.

* **The nature of the claim:** The claim itself is tentative (""might run"").  This uncertainty weakens the connection.  If the claim were more definitive (""Elon Musk announced his candidacy""), the similarity score might be higher, assuming the tweet supported this stronger claim.


In summary, the relationship is weak but exists because of the presence of Elon Musk. The low similarity score reflects the lack of direct textual evidence in the image supporting the claim.  The image's low resolution further hinders CLIP's ability to accurately assess the relationship.  The ""Related"" classification is a cautious assessment based on the minimal information available.  A much higher resolution image of the tweet would allow for a more precise analysis and a potentially higher or lower similarity score depending on the tweet's content.

The provided image URL shows an Associated Press photograph of Mahamudu Bawumia, Vice President of Ghana, giving a speech or address.

Here's why the image and the claim have low relevance:

* **Lack of Context:** The photograph itself provides no context about the *content* of Bawumia's speech. He is simply shown speaking to an audience. There's no indication he is uttering the quoted phrase (""gullible and weak-minded""). The image only shows him in a public speaking role, which is a common activity for a Vice President.  The claim, however, centers on a *specific* controversial statement allegedly made in a *private* setting (a leaked recording).

* **Visual Discrepancy:**  The claim implies a clandestine recording, possibly a private conversation.  The image depicts a public address, likely suggesting a formal, planned event, in sharp contrast to the private, potentially secretive nature implied by the ""leaked recording.""

* **Absence of Evidence:** The image shows nothing to support or refute the claim.  It doesn't show any recording equipment, any reaction from the audience indicative of shock or controversy, or any other visual cues relating to a secret recording.

* **CLIP's Focus:** CLIP, being a visual-language model, excels at associating images with textual descriptions based on visual cues. In this case, it correctly identifies that the image (a photo of a Vice President giving a public speech) bears little visual resemblance to the concept of a ""leaked secret recording"" containing an insulting remark.  The semantic gap between the public image and the private, controversial statement is too large for CLIP to make a strong positive association.

In short, the image provides a visual representation of Bawumia in a public context, while the claim describes a private and controversial event.  These are fundamentally different scenarios, hence the low similarity score and ""Unrelated"" classification.  The image shows the *person* in question, but offers no visual information confirming or denying the *alleged statement* made in the alleged *context*.

The headline, while somewhat obscured, clearly mentions ""UnitedHealthcare"" and what appears to be ""Nancy Pelosi.""  The relationship between the claim (""Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was set to testify against Nancy Pelosi for insider trading"") and the image is established through this shared presence of UnitedHealthcare and Nancy Pelosi.

The similarity score of 0.33 suggests a weak but discernible relationship.  The low score is likely due to several factors:

* **Lack of Brian Thompson's name:** The claim explicitly mentions Brian Thompson, but his name is not visible in the image. This is a crucial missing element that weakens the connection.
* **Ambiguous context:** The image only shows a fragment of the article.  The full context of the news piece is unknown. The article might discuss Pelosi and UnitedHealthcare in a way completely unrelated to insider trading or Brian Thompson's testimony.
* **Headline ambiguity:** While ""UnitedHealthcare"" and ""Nancy Pelosi"" are present, the headline itself doesn't definitively confirm insider trading or Thompson's involvement. The headline's wording might create a connection, but it doesn't directly corroborate the claim.
* **Visual noise:** The image quality is not perfect. The text is partially obscured, making accurate interpretation difficult. This ambiguity further reduces the CLIP model's confidence in establishing a strong relationship.

In summary, CLIP finds a connection because the image contains key entities (UnitedHealthcare and Nancy Pelosi) also mentioned in the claim. However, the lack of explicit mention of Brian Thompson, the ambiguous nature of the headline and visible text, and the overall low image quality result in a low similarity score.  The relationship is suggestive but not conclusive based solely on the provided image.  More information is needed to verify the claim.

The low similarity score (0.25) from CLIP suggests a weak relationship between the image and Elon Musk's statement.  While both relate to the shooting of the UnitedHealthcare CEO, the connection is indirect and lacks strong visual overlap.

Here's a breakdown of why the relationship is weak, despite the shared context:

* **Absence of Elon Musk:** The image contains no mention of Elon Musk or X (formerly Twitter).  The statement is entirely about Musk's reaction to the event, a reaction absent from the image itself.  The image only presents the news of the shooting.

* **Focus on the Event, Not the Reaction:** The image focuses solely on the crime itself, reporting on the shooting. Musk's quote, however, focuses on the *public reaction* to the shooter, specifically condemning the potential glorification of the perpetrator.  These are distinct aspects of the same event.

* **Low Visual Similarity:** CLIP relies heavily on visual similarity.  There's no visual element in the image directly referencing Elon Musk, X, or the concept of public opinion.  The only shared visual element is the textual mention of UnitedHealthcare and the CEO shooting, which is a very general and indirect link.

* **Semantic Distance:** The semantic distance between ""news report of a shooting"" and ""Elon Musk's condemnation of public reaction to the shooting"" is considerable.  While both relate to the same overarching event, they address different aspects.  CLIP struggles with such nuanced semantic relationships.

In summary, the ""Related"" classification with a low similarity score reflects the tenuous connection between the image (a news headline about the shooting) and the statement (Musk's opinion on the public reaction to the shooter).  The shared element is the underlying event, but the focus and perspectives are significantly different, leading to a weak overall relationship according to CLIP's analysis.  The low score reflects the lack of direct visual or semantic overlap.

While the resolution and clarity aren't perfect, several elements likely contribute to CLIP's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.32, despite the low score indicating a relatively weak connection.

Here's a breakdown of why the image might be considered related to the claim:

* **Presence of Text:** The image clearly shows text, though the content is largely illegible.  CLIP excels at recognizing text, even if it can't fully decipher the words. The mere presence of text in a similar context (a social media post) is enough to establish some level of relatedness to the claim about a post on X (formerly Twitter).  The model might be picking up on the general visual structure of a tweet.

* **Layout Similarity:** The image's layout – seemingly a rectangular box containing text – resembles the visual structure of a tweet or X post. This visual similarity, even without legible text, could contribute to a weak positive association. CLIP's understanding of visual layouts plays a role here.

* **Platform Implication (Weak):** Although not definitive, the style might hint at a social media platform. CLIP might be weakly associating this with the X platform mentioned in the claim. The lack of clear branding, however, weakens this connection significantly.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The crucial point is the low similarity score (0.32). This indicates that the visual cues are weak and insufficient to strongly link the image to the specific claim. The image doesn't provide any verification of the claim's content (the Diet Coke ban). The model's uncertainty is reflected in the low score.  It's more of a ""maybe related"" rather than a strong ""definitely related.""

In summary, CLIP is likely associating the image with the claim based on very general visual similarities: the presence of text within a rectangular frame suggestive of a social media post. However, the lack of clear textual information and the low similarity score highlight the weakness of this association.  The model doesn't confirm or deny the claim; it only detects a superficial visual resemblance to the context of the claim, not its content.  A higher-resolution image or one revealing more text would drastically change the similarity score.

Now a viral claim about one of his landmark policies on electric vehicle charging says it has yielded only a handful of stations.
""Pete Buttigieg will leave his post as Transportation Secretary having spent $7.5 BILLION to build 8 EV charging stations,""  U.S. Rep. Michael Rulli, R-Ohio, wrote Nov. 24 on X. ""His legacy will be squandering billions on something nobody wants, while millions struggle to afford the things we need.""
Donald Trump Jr. shared Rulli’s X post and added: ""Does not seem like a great return on investment.""
We saw a similar claim on Facebook. ""Joe Biden’s administration invested $7.5 billion into EV charging stations, but somehow only built 7 or 8 stations in about 2 years, and now people want to know where all the money went,"" a Nov. 29 Facebook post featuring a photo of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said.

This claim is inaccurate. More than eight charging stations have been built and several hundred are still under construction by state and local governments.
Rulli’s office did not respond to our request for comment.
The $7.5 billion figure refers to funding for expanded electric vehicle charging from the 2021 bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The law gave $5 billion for EV charging under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program and $2.5 billion under the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure grant program. The federal government distributes National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure funds to transportation departments in all 50 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia; a wide range of agencies, including municipal governments, tribal governments and universities, can access Charging and Fueling Infrastructure funds. 
A U.S. Federal Highway Administration spokesperson told PolitiFact the two federal programs have so far funded 37 charging stations. Like gas stations, EV charging stations can have multiple charging points.
Of the 37 federally funded stations built in 13 states, there are 226 charging ports, said Rachael Dussuau, the Federal Highway Administration’s associate public affairs administrator. As of Dec. 3, Dussuau said there are projects underway for 24,800 federally funded charging ports.

She told PolitiFact in an email that the recent Facebook claim is ""not true"" and that states have not spent all of the $7.5 billion from the infrastructure law.
To get money from the 2021 law, states and agencies must submit plans to an office run jointly by the Energy and Transportation departments. The Federal Highway Administration approves the plans; state and local jurisdictions oversee construction.
The federally funded EV charging program started slowly. Although the infrastructure law passed in November 2021, the Energy Department said initial state plans were not approved until September 2022. Constructing an EV charging station also requires site selection, permitting, collaborating with utility companies and other aspects of construction.
The Facebook claim likely comes from a March Washington Post report that found the program’s slow rollout meant only seven charging stations had been completed. During his speech at the Republican National Convention, President-elect Donald Trump falsely claimed the Biden administration spent $9 billion on eight chargers.Buttigieg responded to Trump Jr.’s post on X, saying, ""In this program, the chargers are built by the states, not the federal government. And while it takes time to get a novel multi-billion dollar program going across 50 states, the states are on track.""
We rate the claim that ""Pete Buttigieg will leave his post as Transportation Secretary having spent $7.5 BILLION to build 8 EV charging stations"" False.",FALSE,image_166.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GdKTsUQW0AAue-5?format=jpg&name=medium,Related,0.2797247171401977,"The image shows a tweet from a user criticizing Pete Buttigieg's spending on electric vehicle (EV) charging stations.  The tweet highlights a perceived inefficiency in spending $7.5 billion on only 8 stations.

The claim, “Pete Buttigieg will leave his post as Transportation Secretary having spent $7.5 billion to build 8 EV charging stations,” is directly echoed in the text of the tweet.  This is the primary reason why CLIP classified the image as ""Related"" with a similarity score of 0.28.

While the similarity score is relatively low (indicating a weak relationship), this is understandable given the limitations of CLIP.  The model likely focuses on the textual overlap between the claim and the tweet.  It doesn't inherently understand the context or the validity of the underlying claim (which is factually incorrect; the $7.5 billion figure likely refers to a much larger program than just 8 stations).  The image itself doesn't visually depict EV charging stations or Pete Buttigieg.  The relationship is solely based on the textual content of the tweet which directly repeats a key part of the claim, focusing on the high cost and low number of charging stations.

In short, the ""Related"" classification stems from the semantic overlap between the numerical data and the subject of the claim and the content of the tweet.  The low similarity score reflects the lack of visual connection and the inherent ambiguity in interpreting the numerical claim.  The model is simply identifying keyword matches, not judging the truth or broader implications of the statement.

There is nothing in the image that visually connects to Donald Trump, the Dallas Police Department, the Dallas Attorney General's Office, the John F. Kennedy assassination, or even the concept of an arrest.

The low similarity score (0.24) reflects the complete lack of semantic overlap between the image's content and the claim.  CLIP operates by comparing the visual features of the image to the semantic meaning of the text prompt.  Since there's no visual representation of any of the entities or events mentioned in the claim – no people, places, documents, or objects related to them – the model correctly identifies the image as unrelated.

The text message on the phone is illegible and thus contributes nothing to the analysis.  The overall context of the image is purely generic; it could be taken almost anywhere and at any time.  There are no logos, badges, or other identifying marks that would suggest a connection to law enforcement or political figures.

In summary, the CLIP model's response accurately reflects the lack of any visual connection between the image and the claim.  The low similarity score reflects the significant semantic distance between the image's visual content and the text prompt. The model correctly identifies that the image provides no information relevant to verifying or refuting the claim.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.35, while not a strong correlation, likely stems from several factors:

* **Mention of Disney:** The claim explicitly mentions Disney selling ABC. The image contains multiple mentions of Disney, likely in relation to news surrounding the company.  This shared context is the primary reason for the positive (though weak) similarity score.

* **News Headline Nature:** Both the claim and the image deal with news, specifically news about significant corporate events.  The visual style of the image – a collage of news clippings – reinforces this connection.  CLIP might be recognizing the shared thematic element of breaking news related to a major media corporation.

* **Absence of direct connection:** The crucial point is that the image *does not* specifically mention the sale of ABC for $20 billion or the cancellation of ""The View.""  This explains the relatively low similarity score of 0.35. The connection is indirect; it's based on the broader topic of Disney news, not the specifics of the claim.

* **Visual Noise:** The image is cluttered.  Many headlines and images are present, making it difficult for CLIP to isolate and focus on the elements directly relevant to the claim. This visual noise reduces the precision of the similarity assessment.

In summary, the CLIP model establishes a weak relationship because both the claim and the image share a common theme: news about the Disney corporation. However, the lack of direct visual or textual evidence within the image supporting the specific details of the claim (the sale price and ""The View"" cancellation) significantly limits the similarity score.  A higher score would require the image to directly depict or reference those specific details. The 0.35 score reflects this indirect and somewhat tenuous connection.

Another sign the screengrab is fake: The headline’s font does not match CNN’s other web stories. It also borrows its byline and date and time of publication — ""Updated 9:40 PM EST, Mon November 25, 2024"" — from a real CNN story by Brian Stelter headlined, ""Elon Musk floats buying MSNBC, but he’s not the only billionaire who may be interested.""
But that story makes no mention of the Statue of Liberty or Tesla.
The company made its Cybertruck available in 2023, and it has been the subject of several parts recalls. Throughout the 2024 presidential campaign, Musk often used his X platform to amplify false claims about the election and immigration, but a search of his X account turned up no posts about the Statue of Liberty.
We rate the claim that this image shows a real CNN headline Pants on Fire!",FALSE,image_171.jpg,https://archive.is/lYbt3/48b66f37aabcbf1cd689cfcf4db7036d408b4c33.jpg,Related,0.3456088304519653,"The image URL provided shows a screenshot of a satirical news article from the website ""Babylon Bee,"" known for its humorous and often outrageous fake news stories.  The headline mimics the style of sensationalist news headlines often seen in real media outlets, while the content is clearly absurd.

The claim ""A CNN headline says, 'Elon Musk considers melting down Statue of Liberty to make series of limited edition cyber trucks'"" is also absurd and hyperbolic.  It relies on the established public perception of Elon Musk as an eccentric innovator, coupled with the expectation of outlandish headlines from certain media sources.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.35, while not strongly positive, likely stems from several factors:

* **Shared Theme of Elon Musk:** Both the claim and the image center around Elon Musk. This is a strong semantic connection, a key element for CLIP's analysis.  The model recognizes the presence of Musk's name in both contexts.

* **Shared Theme of Absurdity/Satire:**  Both the fabricated CNN headline and the Babylon Bee article are obviously satirical and far-fetched. CLIP might be picking up on this shared tone of hyperbole and unconventionality, even if it doesn't fully grasp the nuances of satire.

* **Visual Similarity (Weak):** While the image itself doesn't directly depict the Statue of Liberty or Cybertrucks, the headline within the image screenshot contains keywords overlapping with the claim.  CLIP’s visual analysis might be weakly picking up on textural similarities between the fonts or layout style of the simulated CNN headline and the actual Babylon Bee headline.  This contributes minimally to the relationship score.

The relatively low similarity score (0.35) indicates that while there's a connection based on shared themes and keywords, the direct visual representation in the image doesn't strongly reinforce the claim. The satire aspect, which is crucial to understanding the context, might be difficult for CLIP to fully interpret.  In essence, CLIP finds a connection through shared subjects and a similar tone of outlandishness, but lacks the understanding of context and satire to give a higher similarity score.

The low similarity score of 0.28 from CLIP suggests a weak relationship, despite the clear thematic connection.  Let's break down why:

The image directly addresses the claim's core components:

* **Elon Musk:** His image is prominently featured.
* **$299 Tesla Phone:** The price point is clearly visible in the graphic's text.
* **iPhone Competitor:** The implication that this phone is a threat to the iPhone is evident from the overall context of the fact-check.

However, several factors contribute to the low similarity score:

* **Lack of Exact Quote:** The image doesn't contain the exact quote ""¡El teléfono Tesla de 299 dólares será el final del iPhone!"".  While the essence of the claim is present, the precise wording is absent. This is a significant difference for CLIP, which focuses on visual and textual matching.

* **Focus on Fact-Checking:** The image is primarily a PolitiFact graphic, focusing on verifying the truthfulness of the claim. The visual elements like the PolitiFact logo and the fact-check rating (likely visible in the full image) emphasize the verification process rather than the phone itself.  CLIP might be less sensitive to the overall message conveyed by the graphic's design and more focused on direct textual and visual matches.

* **Visual Abstraction:**  The image likely uses stylized elements and doesn't show a realistic depiction of the alleged Tesla phone.  CLIP might struggle to establish a strong connection between the abstract graphic representation and a real-world object (a phone).

* **Contextual Understanding:**  CLIP's strength lies in recognizing visual and textual patterns, but it lacks comprehensive contextual understanding.  The meaning behind the fact-check, the potential satire or misinformation surrounding the claim, are aspects CLIP cannot grasp.


In summary, while the image clearly relates to the claim's subject matter, the low similarity score reflects the limitations of CLIP in handling nuanced relationships.  The absence of the precise quote, the focus on fact-checking rather than the phone itself, the abstract visual style, and the lack of deep contextual understanding all contribute to the weak ""Related"" classification with a low confidence score. A higher score would require a much closer visual match, including the exact quote in the image.

The claim, ""Michael Jordan turns down $100 million Disney deal, declares he won’t work for wokeness,"" aligns with the image's overall message.  Therefore, the CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.38 is understandable, albeit not exceptionally strong.

Here's a breakdown of why the connection exists, despite the relatively low similarity score:

* **Michael Jordan's Presence:** The most crucial element is the image of Michael Jordan himself.  This directly connects the image to the claim's subject.

* **Patriotic/Conservative Undertones:** The image uses strong patriotic imagery (the American flag) and implicitly promotes conservative values.  The claim suggests Jordan's rejection of a deal is motivated by a rejection of ""wokeness,"" which is often framed as a conflict with conservative ideologies.  The image's subtle messaging resonates with this framing.

* **Absence of Explicit Connection:** The image lacks any explicit mention of a Disney deal or a rejection of ""wokeness.""  This is why the similarity score isn't higher. The connection is inferential, based on the overall tone and the presence of Jordan.

* **CLIP's Limitations:** CLIP, like other AI models, relies on pattern recognition.  It identifies visual and textual patterns and establishes relationships based on correlations learned from its training data.  While the image's implicit message aligns with the claim's narrative, the absence of explicit textual evidence limits the strength of the relationship identified by CLIP. A score of 0.38 reflects this relatively weak, indirect connection. A higher score would require a more explicit visual representation of the claim's elements.

In summary, the image's patriotic and implicitly anti-""woke"" theme, combined with the presence of Michael Jordan, creates a contextual link with the claim. However, the lack of direct visual evidence related to the specific claim (the Disney deal and the explicit rejection of ""wokeness"") results in a moderate similarity score from CLIP.  The relationship is more about thematic alignment than direct visual correspondence.

The U.S. McDonald’s website does not name ""silicone oil"" as an ingredient in the chicken nuggets. The website lists the following ingredients, and silicone oil (or a related chemical name, ""dimethylpolysiloxane"") isn’t among them:
White boneless chicken, water, vegetable oil (canola oil, corn oil, soybean oil, hydrogenated soybean oil), enriched flour (bleached wheat flour, niacin, reduced iron, thiamine mononitrate, riboflavin, folic acid), bleached wheat flour, yellow corn flour, vegetable starch (modified corn, wheat, rice, pea, corn), salt, leavening (baking soda, sodium aluminum phosphate, sodium acid pyrophosphate, calcium lactate, monocalcium phosphate), spices, yeast extract, lemon juice solids, dextrose, natural flavors.
PolitiFact contacted McDonald’s about this claim and received no reply by the time of publication. 
In our research, we learned that U.S. McDonald’s chicken nuggets once contained dimethylpolysiloxane, an antifoaming agent derived from silicone. It is found in a variety of foods, such as cooking oil, vinegar and chocolate. It’s also added to oil to prevent it from bubbling up when frozen ingredients are added.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approves dimethylpolysiloxane as a food additive. The Code of Federal Regulations Title 21, as of November 2024, says that dimethylpolysiloxane can be added to food not to exceed 1 part per million.
But in 2016, McDonald’s USA announced the removal of artificial preservatives from several menu items, including Chicken McNuggets. Since then, dimethylpolysiloxane has not been in the nuggets’ ingredients. 
The U.S. has more than 13,000 McDonald’s restaurants, by the far the most of any country as of 2023, according to Statista, a German data gathering site. Japan and China are the other countries with the most restaurants, but we could not find complete ingredient lists for their McNuggets.
We also didn’t find silicone oil or dimethylpolysiloxane in the United Kingdom’s and India’s Chicken McNuggets. However, dimethylpolysiloxane is on the ingredient list in Canada’s McNuggets.
This is not the first time we have fact-checked claims about McDonald’s food. In September, we rated a video that claimed the FBI found human remains at a McDonald’s meat supplier Pants on Fire!
McDonald’s Chicken McNuggets in the U.S. — the country with the most McDonald’s locations — no longer contain silicone oil, though it is still listed on the ingredients list in at least Canada. We rate the claim Mostly False.

The claim, ""McDonald's chicken nuggets contain silicone oil,"" is unrelated to the visual content of the image itself.  There's nothing in the picture that visually suggests the presence of silicone oil.  The image simply depicts a breaded chicken nugget; no oil, silicone or otherwise, is visible.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.34 is likely due to a weak association based on semantic information rather than visual similarity.  The model probably connects the image to the claim because:

* **Shared Semantic Concept:**  Both the image and the claim relate to McDonald's chicken nuggets.  The model recognizes the nugget in the image and understands the claim refers to the same product. This forms a weak link, even if the claim makes a specific assertion about the nugget's composition that isn't visually verifiable.

* **Contextual Inference (Potential):** CLIP might be drawing on external knowledge, associating chicken nuggets with processing and potential additives.  While the claim of silicone oil is highly specific and likely untrue, the model might weakly link ""additives"" to the general idea of processed food.  This is speculation, however, as CLIP's internal workings aren't fully transparent.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The crucial point is the relatively low similarity score of 0.34. This indicates a weak relationship.  A high score would suggest a strong visual correspondence, which isn't present. The score reflects the primarily semantic overlap, which is only a loose connection given the highly specific and (likely false) nature of the claim.

In essence, the model isn't identifying silicone oil in the image. Instead, it's recognizing the shared subject matter (McDonald's chicken nuggets) as the basis for a weak ""Related"" classification, driven more by semantic understanding than visual evidence. The low score reflects the lack of direct visual support for the claim within the image.

This aligns directly with the claim ""President-elect Donald Trump called Joe Scarborough “a scolded dog” on Truth Social.""

The similarity score of 0.32 is relatively low, indicating a weak relationship.  This is likely due to several factors:

* **Low Resolution and Partial Visibility:** The image is blurry and partially obscured, making it difficult for CLIP to accurately process the text.  The crucial phrase ""scolded dog"" might not be fully visible or clear enough for confident identification. CLIP relies heavily on clear and sharp visuals for accurate classification.

* **Contextual Understanding:** CLIP struggles with nuanced contextual understanding.  While the image shows a Truth Social post by Trump mentioning Scarborough, it doesn't explicitly contain the exact phrase ""scolded dog."" The model might have connected the post to Scarborough based on the visual cues of Trump's name and the presence of Scarborough's name (likely inferred from the partially visible text), but lacked sufficient information to confirm the specific insult.

* **Ambiguity of Visual Cues:**  Beyond the partially visible text, the image contains no other elements directly related to the claim. There are no visual representations of dogs, scolding, or other elements that could directly reinforce the claim.

In summary, CLIP established a ""Related"" classification based on the partial identification of Trump's post mentioning Joe Scarborough on Truth Social.  The low similarity score reflects the limitations of processing a low-resolution image with partially obscured text and the model's inability to fully grasp the nuanced meaning and context of the post.  The connection is made on a superficial level (Trump + Scarborough on Truth Social) rather than a detailed semantic match with the precise wording of the claim.

This is the strongest link between the image and the claim.  CLIP likely recognizes their faces and associates them with the text mentioning their names.

* **The context:** While the image doesn't explicitly state anything about contract renewals, the context strongly suggests their association with ""The View.""  The audience understands that the pictured women are hosts of the show.  The claim directly relates to their employment status on this very show.  CLIP, however, lacks this deeper contextual understanding. It relies on visual features and learned associations rather than semantic comprehension of the situation.

* **Lack of explicit textual confirmation:** The image contains no text confirming or denying the claim.  This absence limits the strength of the connection. CLIP needs more explicit visual cues to strongly correlate image and text.

* **The low similarity score (0.33):**  This indicates a relatively weak association. The model likely struggles to connect the visual representation of the two women with the abstract concept of contract non-renewal.  The image is simply a photograph; it doesn't convey the news about their contracts.

In summary, the connection stems from the presence of Joy Behar and Whoopi Goldberg in the image, who are the subjects of the claim. However, the lack of explicit textual support in the image and the inherent limitations of CLIP in understanding nuanced contexts result in a low similarity score.  The model identifies the faces, but cannot definitively link the visual data to the claim's meaning about contract renewals.  A human would easily understand the connection; CLIP only makes a weak association based on visual overlap.

That swimmer, the University of Pennsylvania’s Lia Thomas, became the first transgender athlete to win an NCAA Division I title that year, and she and Gaines tied for fifth in the 200-yard freestyle final.
But claims the NCAA decided to transfer Thomas’ medals to Gaines are unfounded.

But we found no evidence, such as credible news reports or public statements from Gaines or the NCAA, to corroborate the claim. NCAA records for 2022 still show Thomas’ first-place finish for the 500-yard freestyle, an eighth-place finish for the 100-yard freestyle and a fifth-place finish — tied with Gaines — for the 200-yard freestyle.
This claim appears to have originated on a self-described satire site. A Dec. 8, 2023, post on SpaceXMania, said: ""‘It’s done’: NCAA shifts all medals from Lia Thomas to Riley Gaines.""
The post is labeled ""satire.""
In January 2022, the NCAA Board of Governors voted ""in support of a sport-by-sport approach to transgender participation that preserves opportunity for transgender student-athletes while balancing fairness, inclusion and safety for all who compete,"" according to a Jan. 19, 2022, statement on the NCAA’s website. The new policy, effective starting with the 2022 championships, requires transgender student-athletes to document sport-specific testosterone levels beginning four weeks before their sport's championship selections. As of the 2022-23 academic year, transgender student-athletes need to document testosterone levels at the beginning of their season, six months later, and four weeks before championship selections.

The claim ""NCAA shifts all medals from Lia Thomas to Riley Gaines"" refers to a controversial event surrounding Thomas's participation in women's collegiate swimming and the subsequent debate about fairness and inclusion in women's sports.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.26 indicates a weak connection between the image and the claim.  While the image directly depicts Lia Thomas, the connection to the claim is tenuous due to the following:

* **Absence of Context:** The image itself provides no information about the NCAA, Riley Gaines, or any medal reallocation.  It simply shows Thomas swimming. The claim necessitates knowledge of the specific controversy surrounding her participation and the alleged medal shift, which is not visually present.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The score of 0.26 reflects a low degree of visual similarity.  The image is purely visual and doesn't contain any textual or contextual clues directly linking it to the claim's specific events.  Higher scores usually signify stronger visual connections.

* **Indirect Relationship:** The only link is the presence of Lia Thomas, who is the central figure in the controversy mentioned in the claim. However, the image doesn't depict the events or outcomes referenced in the claim (the medal shift).  It's merely a picture of her swimming, which is related to the broader context but not the specific claim's assertion.

In essence, the CLIP model likely identified a weak relationship based solely on the presence of Lia Thomas, the central figure in the event described by the claim.  The lack of visual representation of the medal shift, Riley Gaines, or any textual context severely limits the strength of the connection, resulting in a low similarity score. The relationship is more about shared semantic space (both relate to Lia Thomas) than visual similarity.

The words and image in the Threads post originated in a Nov. 19 X post from PoliticsVideoChannel, a self-described news and media company, whose X profile says, ""Facts matter!""

That X post had more than 1 million views by Nov. 20. In a long thread about the bill, it said it referred to the Ending Trading and Holdings in Congressional Stocks Act, or ETHICS Act for short, and linked to a July 24 news release from Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev.
But neither the Senate or U.S. House has passed the bill, so there is nothing for Biden to sign. And the bill would not prevent Trump from serving as president.

The bill would immediately bar members of Congress, the president and the vice president from buying and selling securities, commodities, futures, options, trusts and other comparable holdings, a Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Senate Committee summary said.
Beginning March 31, 2027, those elected officials — and their spouses and dependent children — will have 120 days to divest from those assets.
The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs on July 24 voted 8-4 to approve a revamped version of S.1171, a bill Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., introduced in April. Merkley, fellow Democrats Gary Peters, D-Mich., and Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., and Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., announced agreement on the revamped legislation July 10.

A Merkley spokesperson told PolitiFact in an email that the proposed law would not ""ban"" Trump from becoming president, but would require him to change his financial holdings to be in compliance.
Trump is the largest shareholder in Truth Social, his social media company, and said he has no intention to sell his stock in the company. But nothing in the bill’s language would prevent Trump — or any Congress member — from serving for breaching the law. Instead, there are financial penalties.
If the bill became law, violators would have to forfeit their monthly salaries or pay 10% of the value of each asset, whichever is greater, the bill’s summary said. It would also raise penalties in the 2012 STOCK Act for failure to report holdings from $200 to $500 per violation.
A U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs spokesperson also said individuals would face fines until they comply with the divestment requirements of the law, if it's passed. The Office of Government Ethics would have to assess Trump's assets case by case, the spokesperson said.
Our ruling
A Threads post said, ""The U.S Senate accidentally passed a bill banning Trump from becoming President, and Biden is planning to sign it."" The X post the claim originated from referred to the Ending Trading and Holdings in Congressional Stocks Act. 
But nothing in that bill would keep Trump from being president. It advanced from a Senate committee and has not been scheduled for a full Senate vote. If the Senate and the House pass the measure and the president signs it into law, it would prevent members of Congress, the president and vice president from buying, selling and owning stocks. Violators would face financial penalties, but they would not be barred from office.

There's no text related to US politics, Donald Trump, Joe Biden, or Senate bills. The overall scene is generic and depicts a common workplace activity.

The claim, ""The U.S Senate accidentally passed a bill banning Trump from becoming President, and Biden is planning to sign it,"" is entirely about a specific political event involving high-profile individuals and a significant legislative action.

The CLIP model's classification of ""Unrelated"" with a similarity score of 0.23 is perfectly justified because there's no visual connection between the image and the claim. The image contains no elements that visually represent:

* **The Senate:**  No building, people, or symbols associated with the US Senate are shown.
* **Donald Trump or Joe Biden:** There are no images or references to either individual.
* **A bill banning Trump:** The image shows no paperwork or legal documents.
* **Politics or legislation:** The image is devoid of any political symbols, slogans, or political figures.
* **Accidental passing of a bill:** The image provides no visual representation of an accidental event.

The low similarity score (0.23) reflects the lack of semantic overlap between the purely political claim and the entirely generic, non-political image.  The image is entirely unrelated to the subject matter of the claim; it’s simply a picture of someone working on a computer, a scene unrelated to any political context.  Therefore, CLIP's classification is accurate and reflects its ability to assess the lack of visual-semantic connection between the image and the text.

A car is partially submerged, and the water level appears to be significantly high, reaching the lower parts of buildings.  There are no obvious identifying landmarks or text in the image that explicitly states the location is Spain or France.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.30 suggests a weak connection between the image and the claim ""Video shows floods in Spain and France.""  This low score reflects the lack of direct evidence supporting the claim within the image itself.

Here's a breakdown of why the score is relatively low:

* **Absence of Location Information:** The image provides no geographical context.  There are no street signs, building names, or other identifying features that would place the flood in Spain or France. This is a major factor contributing to the low similarity score.  CLIP relies heavily on visual features and contextual information; the lack of location information severely limits its ability to connect the image to the specific claim.

* **Generic Nature of the Image:** The image depicts a common scene of urban flooding.  Flooding looks similar across many geographical locations.  This generic nature makes it difficult for CLIP to definitively link the image to Spain or France specifically.  The model likely identifies the core concept of ""flooding"" but lacks sufficient visual cues to pinpoint the location.

* **Similarity Score Interpretation:** A score of 0.30 is considered relatively low in the context of CLIP similarity scores. This indicates a weak association rather than a strong confirmation.  It suggests that the model detected some overlap in concepts (e.g., ""flood,"" ""water,"" ""street""), but not enough to strongly support the claim about the specific location.

In summary, while the image depicts flooding, which is consistent with the claim's general subject matter, the absence of location-specific details results in a low similarity score.  The CLIP model lacks the geographical knowledge to confirm the location as Spain or France based solely on the visual information provided.  Additional information, such as a news report or metadata associated with the image, would be needed to confidently verify the claim.

The absence of any of the following strongly supports the ""Unrelated"" classification:

* **Elon Musk's likeness:** No visual representation of Elon Musk himself.

* **Food imagery:** No depiction of food or meals.

The model likely made the ""Related"" classification based on the presence of Mike Tyson himself.  Since the claim involves Mike Tyson, the image featuring him provides a minimal level of relevance.  However, the critical element missing – the Palestinian flag – renders the connection extremely weak.

The image only shows Tyson in a boxing stance, with potentially some branding or sponsors visible (difficult to determine without higher resolution).

In short, the classification is based solely on the presence of Mike Tyson, the main subject of both the claim and the image.  The absence of the key element mentioned in the claim (the Palestinian flag) significantly weakens the relationship, resulting in a low similarity score and a ""Related"" classification that should be interpreted with extreme caution.

As of Nov. 19, about 16,400 votes separated Republican Dave McCormick from incumbent Sen. Bob Casey, according to CNN. The Associated Press called the race for McCormick on Nov. 7, but Casey has not conceded. The race is within the 0.5% margin that triggers an automatic recount by state law.
The counties must begin the recount by Nov. 20. Some counties have already started tabulating the 7 million paper ballots that will be recounted. 
X owner Elon Musk, who leveraged his massive wealth this year to campaign for President-elect Donald Trump and Republicans in Pennsylvania and elsewhere, accused Casey of trying to count the votes of noncitizens, who are legally barred from voting. 
""The Democratic Party senate candidate in Pennsylvania is trying to change the outcome of the election by counting NON-CITIZEN votes, which is illegal,"" Musk wrote Nov. 13 on X. 
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
This claim lacks evidence. 
The Casey and McCormick campaigns have sparred over the validity of an estimated 60,000 provisional ballots across Pennsylvania’s 67 counties. Provisional ballots are cast when voters’ eligibility to vote is in question — records may show that these people already voted, or are not registered in the correct county, or are not registered to vote at all. 
After the election, county officials verify whether provisional ballots are valid. Ballots deemed valid are included in the final vote count; invalid ballots are thrown out. Campaigns can challenge decisions to accept or reject those ballots. 
This process happens in every election in nearly every state. 
The Casey and McCormick campaigns have disagreed about whether to count provisional ballots. But so far, the citizenship of voters who cast provisional ballots isn’t in question. 
PolitiFact reviewed public ballot hearings in Pennsylvania and examined local reporting on provisional ballot challenges. We found no instances of ballots being rejected because someone wasn’t a citizen, or because Casey’s campaign had asked officials to count known noncitizens’ votes. Local outlets reporting on Musk’s claim called it false.
X’s press team did not respond to our query about Musk’s claim.
McCormick’s campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment. McCormick’s campaign manager, Matt Gruda, has accused Casey’s campaign of trying to count unregistered voters, but neither Gruda nor the campaign has said publicly that noncitizens were voting.
Challenging the validity of ballots
Casey’s campaign has broadly called for election officials to count as many provisional ballots as possible. That includes ballots missing poll workers’ signatures, voter information or secrecy envelopes. 
Casey’s campaign also challenged the rejection of batches of ballots in counties in which voters’ names could not be found on the counties’ voter registration lists. The campaign asked officials to recheck the registration lists and said the ballots of voters with pending registrations should be accepted. 
In many cases, the Casey campaign later reviewed those ballots and presented officials with ballots it believed had been mislabeled as coming from people who weren’t registered to vote.
A Casey campaign lawyer, in a letter to Lackawanna County’s solicitor, said ballots should be accepted if the voters who cast them were registered in a different county but moved to and voted in a new county within the last 30 days. The attorney also said voters with pending registration statuses should be allowed to vote if their registration applications were valid, and added that counties should follow federal law when removing voters from voter rolls. 
Gruda, McCormick’s campaign manager, has called these efforts an attempt to count the votes of people who are not registered to vote. He said in a Nov. 13 X post that Casey is ""trying to illegally count UNREGISTERED voters as a way to cut into (McCormick’s) margin.""
Gruda’s post is in the chain of X posts on which Musk commented, although the campaign did not mention noncitizens.

Casey’s campaign has denied calling for nonregistered voters’ ballots to be counted, and said it is asking officials not to reject votes from voters who are registered. 
""No one is trying to count votes from individuals who were not registered,"" Casey campaign lawyer Adam Bonin said. ""This is categorically false.""
McCormick’s campaign has asked that ballots be rejected if the voters’ names aren’t on voter rolls. County officials have generally voted to throw those ballots out; some have said they will verify the status of voters Democrats identified as being registered. 
In videos of provisional ballot hearings reviewed by PolitiFact, in Philadelphia and Allegheny, Lancaster and Montgomery counties, the issue of noncitizens casting ballots did not come up. And the letter from Casey’s campaign listing the reasons it asked for ballots to be counted did not include any reference to noncitizens. 
James Allen, Delaware County’s elections director, said there was no dispute about noncitizen voters when the county reviewed provisional ballots. 
""We had hundreds and hundreds of challenges but we haven’t had one person say, ‘Ah, look at this, a group of noncitizens,’"" Allen said. 
Allen said Musk, and other people who claimed noncitizens are voting, have not provided evidence that noncitizens voted in Pennsylvania. 
The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Seth Bluestein, a Republican commissioner in Philadelphia, said he did not see challenges in the city that were based on noncitizen voters. Pittsburgh radio station WESA-FM reported that Lackawanna County Solicitor Donald Frederickson Jr. said noncitizen voters were not an issue in his county, either.
Our ruling
Musk said Casey is ""trying to change the outcome of the election by counting NON-CITIZEN votes, which is illegal.""
The U.S. Senate candidates in Pennsylvania are dueling over whether provisional ballots in counties across the state are valid. In many cases, Casey’s campaign has challenged the rejection of ballots from voters who were not found on the counties’ voter rolls. 
But Casey’s campaign has not asked for noncitizen votes to be counted. In the county meetings PolitiFact reviewed, noncitizen votes were not at issue. McCormick’s campaign has also not claimed Casey is trying to count noncitizen votes.

The relatively low similarity score of 0.34 from CLIP suggests a weak connection between the image and the claim, despite the image's relevance to the claim.  Let's analyze why CLIP might have classified it as ""Related"" with such a low score.

The connection hinges on the presence of Senator Bob Casey in the image. The claim directly quotes Senator Casey making a serious allegation about non-citizen votes impacting an election. The image visually confirms the presence of Senator Casey, the individual making the claim. This is the primary reason for the ""Related"" classification.

However, the low similarity score can be explained by several factors:

* **Lack of direct visual evidence supporting the claim:** The image doesn't show any evidence of non-citizen voting or attempts to change election outcomes. It's simply a picture of Senator Casey speaking, which is only indirectly related to the core of his statement.  The image lacks visual cues about the substance of his claim.

* **Ambiguous context:**  The image provides no context about the *content* of Senator Casey's speech.  He could be speaking about many different things. The image alone doesn't reveal the specific topic under discussion.  The claim's detail is missing from the visual.

* **CLIP's limitations:** CLIP excels at recognizing objects and associating them with concepts but struggles with nuanced relationships, especially in the realm of political statements and claims.  Understanding the context and implications of a political statement requires far more sophisticated semantic analysis than simple image recognition. The low score reflects this limitation; it sees Casey, but can't visually verify the truth or falsity of his statement.

* **Image quality and composition:** The image is a standard press conference photo; it’s not particularly evocative or visually striking.  This lack of visual ""punch"" might contribute to a lower similarity score.


In summary, CLIP connects the image and the claim based solely on the visual presence of Senator Casey.  The low similarity score reflects the lack of visual corroboration for the *content* of his statement.  The image is relevant in the sense that it shows the person making the claim, but it offers no visual evidence to support or refute the claim itself.  The connection is weak, hence the low score.

The tweet promotes a Pride-themed video or campaign related to *Puss in Boots: The Last Wish*. The text clearly displays celebratory Pride messaging.  The visual element is a still image from the movie featuring Puss in Boots, decorated with rainbow colors associated with Pride flags.

The claim, ""Elon Musk bans DreamWorks Animation from X for promoting Pride,"" suggests a causal relationship between DreamWorks Animation's Pride-themed promotion and a ban from the X (formerly Twitter) platform under Elon Musk's leadership.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.32 indicates a weak but detectable relationship between the image and the claim. The relatively low score reflects the lack of direct evidence of a ban within the image itself.  The image only shows the promotional tweet; it doesn't show any communication from X or Elon Musk regarding a ban.

The relationship is inferred: The image shows evidence of DreamWorks promoting Pride (part of the claim), and the claim asserts a consequence (a ban).  The CLIP model likely establishes the connection by identifying:

* **Shared Entities:** Both the claim and the image involve DreamWorks Animation and a Pride-related campaign. This shared semantic content contributes to the ""Related"" classification.
* **Contextual Understanding:**  CLIP, while not fully understanding the nuances of a potential ban, likely recognizes the promotional nature of the tweet and connects it to the claim about a potential consequence related to that promotion.  The claim suggests a negative action (banning) based on the positive, Pride-promoting action depicted in the image.

The low similarity score (0.32) indicates that the connection is tenuous and based primarily on the shared entities and the inferred contextual relationship.  A higher score would require direct evidence in the image, such as a notification from X about a ban or a statement from Elon Musk.  The image only provides one half of the claimed causal relationship.  Therefore, while related, the connection is weak and indirect.

That McDonald’s uses seed oil and not beef tallow to make its french fries is not a revelation Kennedy exposed. McDonald’s — along with fast-food competitors Burger King and Wendy’s — made the switch from beef tallow in 1990 amid national concerns about saturated fat in Americans’ diets.
McDonald’s website said the company uses a canola-blend oil to fry potatoes at its restaurants, and said its cut potato suppliers partially fry them first in an oil blend that contains beef flavoring.
Kennedy argues that seed oils such as canola oil are causing an obesity epidemic.
The New York Times reported that experts said research of seed oils shows the opposite, and that they are much healthier than using animal fat.

The low similarity score of 0.27 from CLIP indicates a weak relationship between the image and the claim, ""McDonald’s offered 850 million to RFK for hush money related to its frying oil.""  Let's break down why the classifier might have deemed them *slightly* related:

The connection, however tenuous, hinges on the association of McDonald's with french fries and, by extension, its frying oil. The claim alleges a hush-money payment related to the oil.  The image directly depicts a McDonald's french fry container, visually linking the claim to the brand.  The ""Trump Fries"" modification is irrelevant to the core association, as it merely alters the branding of the container, not the core product (fries cooked in McDonald's oil).

The reasons for the low similarity score are much more significant:

* **Lack of Direct Connection:** The image provides no information about hush money, RFK, or any scandal. It only shows a modified fry container.  The connection is purely inferential and based on a shared brand element (McDonald's).

* **Irrelevance of ""Trump Fries"":** The alteration of the container to ""Trump Fries"" introduces a completely unrelated political element, further distancing the image from the core of the claim.  This might even negatively impact the similarity score.

* **Absence of Context:**  The image lacks any context suggesting wrongdoing or a cover-up involving frying oil.  CLIP likely struggles to link the simple image of a fry container to the complex claim of a massive hush-money payment.

* **Visual vs. Textual Information:** CLIP processes both visual and textual information. While the visual element (McDonald's fry container) provides a weak link, the textual claim is very specific and complex, making the overall match weak. The model struggles to bridge the gap between the simplistic visual and the multifaceted textual claim.

In essence, the classifier likely flagged a *very weak* connection based on the brand association.  The low similarity score (0.27) accurately reflects the lack of a substantial relationship.  The image is essentially only tenuously related because McDonald's is mentioned in the claim and is visually present in the image.  Anything else is conjecture and would not be something the model is directly trained to interpret.

Therefore, I cannot analyze the image and explain why CLIP classified it as ""Related"" to the claim about Elon Musk blocking Disney's pride content on X with a similarity score of 0.40.

To understand the relationship, I need the image content described.  However, I can speculate on *possible* reasons for a 0.40 similarity score given the claim.  This score suggests a moderate, but not strong, relationship.  Possible reasons include:

* **Presence of Disney characters:** If the image contains Disney characters, especially those associated with LGBTQ+ representation or themes, this could contribute to the similarity score.  The claim mentions Disney's pride content, so the presence of these characters creates a connection, even if indirect.

* **Visual depiction of pride or LGBTQ+ themes:** If the image contains rainbow colors, pride flags, or other symbols associated with LGBTQ+ pride, this would link it to the ""pride content"" mentioned in the claim.  The connection would be stronger if the image depicts a protest or a stance against censorship.

* **Text related to Disney, Pride, or Elon Musk:** If the image contains text mentioning any of these keywords, the similarity score would increase.  Even indirect references could contribute. For example, an image showing a news headline mentioning a controversy surrounding Disney and LGBTQ+ representation would be relevant.

* **Elon Musk imagery:** The presence of Elon Musk's image or the X (formerly Twitter) logo could contribute to the relationship, as the claim directly involves him.

* **General context of controversy:** Even if the image doesn't directly depict the specific events mentioned in the claim, it might show a broader context of social or political controversy surrounding LGBTQ+ rights or corporate responses to such issues. This broader thematic connection could explain a moderate similarity score.


A similarity score of 0.40 indicates a moderate link.  The image likely doesn't show a direct depiction of Elon Musk blocking Disney content but contains elements tangentially related to the claim's components (Disney, Pride, censorship, possibly Elon Musk).  Without seeing the image, this is the best possible explanation.  A higher similarity score would imply a more direct visual connection to the claim.

The image itself contains no overt references to boycotts, Pride nights, or the Pittsburgh Steelers.

The likely reason for the weak positive correlation lies in the contextual information provided by the claim:  ""Following Chiefs, Steelers also announce boycott of Pride nights.”

The CLIP model, lacking true understanding, is likely connecting the image to the claim based on these superficial associations:

* **The Chiefs:** The image prominently features a Kansas City Chiefs player.  The claim mentions the Chiefs as initiating the boycott action.  This is the strongest, albeit indirect, link. The model associates the Chiefs' branding (visible in the image) with the news about the Chiefs.

* **NFL Context:**  Both the Chiefs and Steelers are NFL teams. The image, being an official NFL team photo, shares the broad context of the NFL with the news about the teams' actions regarding Pride nights.  This broad thematic connection is very weak.

* **Lack of Negativity Detection:** The image is positive and celebratory in nature; it's a promotional photo.  The claim, however, reports on a controversial and potentially negative action (a boycott). CLIP likely struggles to reconcile the positive visual tone with the negative news context.


In essence, the ""Related"" classification is not based on a strong visual similarity but rather on a very weak semantic association:  the image shows something related to one of the teams mentioned in the news story.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a low similarity score of 0.25 strongly suggests a weak connection between the claim (""Elon Musk: 'I Am Releasing Tesla's $7,000 NEW Car That Runs On PURE Solar Power!'"") and the contents of the Tesla press release page.

Here's why the low similarity score and ""Related"" classification are likely:

* **Absence of a $7,000 solar-powered car:** The claim mentions a specific, revolutionary vehicle – a $7,000 car running solely on solar power.  Tesla's press releases, while covering various aspects of their business, are unlikely to feature this specific model unless it has been officially announced.  The absence of any mention of such a car would significantly lower the similarity score.

* **Generic nature of the press release page:** The press release page likely contains various images and documents related to Tesla's announcements, financials, or other news. These are unlikely to contain visual elements directly supporting the claim. The generic nature reduces the likelihood of visual cues aligning with the claim's specifics.

* **Semantic mismatch:** Even if the press release contained images of solar panels or electric vehicles, the claim's specifics (price and pure solar power) are highly improbable and wouldn't be directly depicted in generic press release materials. The semantic gap between the claim's exceptional nature and the likely general nature of the press release content contributes to the low similarity score.

* **CLIP's limitations:** CLIP, like other AI models, can struggle with nuanced understanding.  It likely identifies some general keywords (Tesla, car, solar) leading to a weak ""Related"" classification, but the low similarity score reflects the mismatch in the specificity and plausibility of the claim compared to the likely content of the press release page.

In summary, the low similarity score reflects the significant discrepancy between the highly specific and arguably unsubstantiated claim about a revolutionary Tesla car and the likely generic and less specific visual and textual content of the Tesla press release page. The ""Related"" classification is a weak positive correlation based on broadly related keywords rather than a strong visual or semantic match.  The claim is likely false or misleading.

But these claims are wrong on a few fronts. YouTube star-turned-boxer Paul, 27, won the fight against former two-time heavyweight champion Tyson, 58. The match, which was Nov. 15 in Arlington, Texas, and streamed on Netflix, lasted the agreed-upon eight, two-minute rounds. Professional men’s boxing matches are typically three minutes per round, but Paul and Tyson agreed to change the rules for this match.

It's clearly a fake or altered image designed to represent a hypothetical fight outcome. The low similarity score of 0.33 from CLIP indicates a weak relationship, which is accurate given the circumstances.

The claim, ""Stunning Knockout: Mike Tyson Defeats Jake Paul in Just 50 Seconds with a Devastating K.O.,"" directly depicts a specific and dramatic event – a quick knockout victory for Tyson.  The image, while showing Tyson and Paul in a boxing context, doesn't visually depict that specific event.  It's a static image, not a dynamic representation of a knockout.

Here's a breakdown of why the similarity score is low despite the thematic connection:

* **Lack of Action:** The image shows Tyson and Paul seemingly in a neutral pose, not in the midst of a fight or a knockout.  There's no visible impact, struggle, or the aftermath of a knockout.  The claim requires a dynamic visual representation of a swift and decisive victory, which is completely absent.

* **Digital Manipulation:** The obvious artificiality of the image lowers the similarity.  The image likely uses AI upscaling or other manipulation techniques which makes it less connected to a real-world event (the hypothetical boxing match). Real photos from a real fight would have significantly higher similarity.

* **Contextual Difference:** While both the claim and image concern a hypothetical Tyson-Paul fight, the claim specifies a particular result (a 50-second knockout) that isn't visually represented. The image only presents the two boxers together – a generic visual that could represent any point in a fight or even a pre-fight photo opportunity.

* **CLIP's Limitations:** CLIP is a multimodal model; its understanding is based on correlation, not causality or nuanced understanding of narrative.  While it recognizes the individual elements (Tyson, Paul, boxing ring), it struggles to connect the static image to the dynamic description in the claim.  The lack of visual evidence of the knockout significantly reduces the similarity score.

In essence, the image provides a very general context related to the claim, but lacks the specific visual details required to accurately depict the claimed event.  The 0.33 similarity score reflects this significant gap between the claim's descriptive narrative and the image's static, and somewhat artificial, representation.

A score of 0.26 suggests a weak relationship, which is understandable considering the image and claim are only tenuously linked. Let's break down why:

The image shows Taylor Swift.  That's the primary and almost sole visual element.  There is no mention of Elon Musk, algorithms, or radicalization. The relationship hinges entirely on the *textual* portion of the claim, specifically the mention of Taylor Swift.

The low similarity score likely arises from these factors:

* **Lack of visual connection:** The image contains no visual cues related to Elon Musk, algorithms, or the concept of radicalization.  There are no robots, computer screens, or any other visual metaphors that could be associated with these concepts.  The image is simply a portrait of Taylor Swift.

* **Indirect textual connection:** The only link between the image and the claim is the mention of Taylor Swift's name.  This is a weak connection because the claim attributes a quote to her that is inherently unrelated to her public image or typical subject matter.  The quote itself is highly improbable and likely false.

* **CLIP's limitations:** CLIP excels at associating images with text that directly depicts the image's content.  It's less adept at handling nuanced relationships, implied meanings, or highly improbable statements.  The claim contains a surprising and controversial assertion about Taylor Swift and Elon Musk, which falls outside the usual patterns CLIP is trained on.

* **The nature of the quote:** The quote itself is highly unusual and arguably absurd.  The probability of Taylor Swift making such a statement is extremely low.  This lack of plausibility further weakens the connection between the image and the claim in CLIP's assessment.

In summary, the weak relationship score (0.26) accurately reflects the limited connection between the image of Taylor Swift and the improbable claim about her quoting a controversial statement concerning Elon Musk and algorithm-induced radicalization. The connection is purely based on the shared mention of Taylor Swift's name, with no supporting visual or contextual elements in the image.  The low score indicates that CLIP correctly identified the weak, indirect, and arguably fabricated nature of the link.

The similarity score of 0.29 between the claim and the image, while low, suggests a relationship primarily based on the shared subject: Elon Musk's net worth.

The claim states Musk has $180 billion.  The image's headline corrects that figure, stating it's closer to $200 billion.  While the claim and the image don't directly contradict each other (a $20 billion difference isn't necessarily a major contradiction in the context of such vast sums), they address the same fundamental point: the magnitude of Elon Musk's wealth.  The image provides a factual correction or refinement to a key numerical element in the claim.

The low similarity score (0.29) reflects the indirect nature of the relationship.  The image doesn't directly address the claim's calculation (giving everyone $1 billion). It focuses solely on the accuracy of the stated net worth.  CLIP likely registers the shared subject (""Elon Musk,"" ""net worth,"" ""billions"") and the numerical proximity, resulting in a weak but existent correlation.  The discrepancy between the stated $180 billion and the corrected $200 billion likely isn't considered significant enough by CLIP to generate a higher similarity score.  The image also doesn't include visual elements strongly linked to the claim's mathematical operation (e.g., no charts or graphs depicting distributions of money).

In summary, the relationship is established through the shared subject and the numerical proximity concerning Elon Musk's net worth.  The low similarity score is due to the image not directly addressing the claim's calculation, only a detail within it (the net worth figure). The relationship is tenuous, primarily based on the shared topic, and not a strong direct connection.

Government entities and their partners are often the target of misinformation following natural disasters such as Helene, and PolitiFact North Carolina has fact-checked multiple misleading claims since the storm hit. Among them: the false claims that federal agencies tried to seize land and resources in western North Carolina.
Likewise, this video features claims that are inaccurate.
Red Cross shelters
First, the American Red Cross is not planning to close its western North Carolina shelters on Nov. 15 — because the humanitarian nonprofit organization has already closed all of its shelters in that region, a Red Cross spokesperson said.
""As of (Nov.) 12th, the Red Cross was no longer managing any shelters in Western North Carolina,"" Stephanie Fox, a spokesperson for the group, told PolitiFact in an email.
On Nov. 9 and Nov. 10, the Red Cross transferred management of its last remaining shelter to Western Carolina Rescue Ministries, Fox said. That shelter, at the Gold’s Gym in Asheville, will remain open through at least Dec. 31, Fox said.
Closing shelters is also a sign that Helene victims have successfully found shelter, Fox said.
""Less shelters being open means residents have been able to secure — whether on their own, through our support, or through the support of other partners — viable housing solutions,"" she said. ""Those who still face barriers to securing housing solutions remain at the facility being managed by the Western Carolina Rescue Ministries while they, the Red Cross, and other partners continue to work with them to identify the many ways we can help with transitioning to a new normal.""
Not keeping children
The Red Cross doesn’t take custody of children, Fox said. ""We do not serve in any role that involves separating children from their families,"" she said.
There’s also no state-driven effort to assume custody of any Helene victim’s children, said Hannah Jones, a North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson. The accusation that social service departments are threatening to remove children from their parents is false, Jones said. 
Legal Aid, a nonprofit law firm providing free legal services to victims of Helene in western North Carolina, hadn’t received any concerns about those victims losing custody of their children, said Jonathan Perry, Legal Aid’s western regional manager.

""Not once did this question arise in those shelters nor the other mountain shelters we visited. I have not heard one report of this on the ground.""
State law allows North Carolinians to file a Child Protective Services report if they believe a child’s lack of shelter could lead to maltreatment, Jones said. However, Legal Aid experts said removing children from their parents typically requires an investigation and approval from the courts. 
In cases in which families have lost their homes to natural disasters, such as Helene, county government officials would try to find shelter for the whole family so it could remain together, said Jones, the health department spokesperson.
To support that effort, state lawmakers recently approved disaster relief bills that included millions of dollars for local county governments in disaster-affected areas. Government and community agencies have the resources to help families find shelters, housing programs and rental assistance, Jones said. 
""When local departments of social services respond to (child welfare reports), efforts would be made to assist the family in locating a safe place to live so that the family could remain together,"" Jones said. ""Child Welfare Services’ priority is to preserve families when this can safely occur.""

The American Red Cross has already closed the shelters it manages and rebutted the claims in the video. The nonprofit says it’s not involved in taking custody of children, and independent lawyers helping families in western North Carolina say they haven’t heard of this happening.

The image suggests an official Red Cross communication or response to a situation. Given that the claim focuses on a Red Cross action (shelter closures) and policy (regarding child safety), the image's context makes it plausible that the event depicted might concern this exact issue.

The image alone doesn't verify or falsify the claim.

It’s from the account ""Reagan Was Right,"" which describes itself as a ""satire/parody"" account and notes that ""nothing on this page is real.""
CBS News reported Nov. 12 that some grocery prices dipped in October for the first time since January 2020.
In its ""food price outlook"" for 2024 and 2025, the U.S. Agriculture Department forecast, ""In 2025, food prices are expected to increase more slowly than the historical average rate of growth.""

A similarity score of 0.40 suggests a moderate level of relationship, not a strong one.

However, I can speculate on potential reasons based on the nature of the claim and typical grocery store imagery:

The image likely contains elements commonly associated with grocery shopping or one of the three mentioned grocery store chains (Kroger, Food Lion, Publix).  These elements could include:

* **Store signage:** The presence of any of the three store logos or even generic grocery store signage would contribute to the ""Related"" classification.
* **Grocery products:** Pictures of food items, shelves stocked with goods, or shopping carts would suggest a connection to grocery shopping and thus the claim regarding price cuts.
* **Promotional materials:**  Any in-store advertisement, flyer, or digital display mentioning sales, discounts, or price reductions could significantly boost the ""Related"" score.  Even if it doesn't explicitly mention the 4% figure or all three chains, the general theme of price reductions would be relevant.
* **Customer activity:** Images of shoppers, checkout lines, or people browsing aisles further reinforce the grocery shopping context.
* **News article screenshots:** If the image is a screenshot of a news article discussing the price cuts, even partially visible text could heavily influence CLIP's classification.

The 0.40 score indicates that while the image contains elements relevant to the claim, it's not a direct or highly unambiguous representation of the announcement.  The image might lack crucial details, such as explicit mention of the 4% price cut, or may contain distracting elements that dilute the relevance.  It might show a general grocery store scene without any specific reference to the price cut announcement.  Alternatively, the image quality or resolution might be impacting the accuracy of the classification.


To accurately explain the classification, the image itself needs to be analyzed.  Providing the image allows for a concrete assessment of the visual components that led to the CLIP's classification.

The White House didn’t immediately respond to PolitiFact’s questions about the post. Harris, meanwhile, has conceded the election. And we found no evidence, such as public statements from the White House or Biden or credible news coverage to support the claim that Biden has agreed to a recount. 
State laws govern  processes for disputing election results, the Library of Congress notes. Sometimes recounts are initiated automatically. In Pennsylvania, for example, the unofficial results in the U.S. Senate race Nov. 5 triggered a legally required statewide count because they were within one-half of 1 percentage point. A recount can also be initiated ""at the request of a person or group with legal standing,"" the Library of Congress says. ""Each state has its own laws for conducting recounts."" 
Forty-one states and Washington, D.C., permit a losing candidate, a voter, a group of voters, or other concerned parties to petition for a recount, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Biden voted in Delaware, which allows any candidate for statewide office in a general election to apply to the court for a recount if the margin is less than 1,000 votes or less than 0.5% of all votes cast for two candidates — whichever amount is less, the National Conference of State Legislatures says.

There is no mention of Joe Biden, the 2024 presidential election, or a recount.  The lack of any relevant visual or textual elements directly related to the claim is why the CLIP model classified the image as ""Unrelated"" with a low similarity score of 0.17.

Here's a breakdown of why the image lacks relevance:

* **Absence of Key Entities:** The claim explicitly mentions Joe Biden, the 2024 presidential election, and a recount.  None of these are visually present in the image.  There are no pictures of Biden, no text mentioning the election year, and no text referring to a recount.

* **Diverse and Unconnected Content:** The image is a chaotic collage of different elements. It's a collection of various images and text snippets seemingly thrown together without a unifying theme.  This lack of cohesion makes it highly improbable that any relationship exists between the image's content and the claim about Biden agreeing to a recount.

* **CLIP's Functionality:** CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training) works by comparing the textual description to the visual features of an image. It identifies correlations between words and visual patterns learned during its training.  Because there's no overlap between the words in the claim and the visual and textual elements in the image, the similarity score is very low.  The model effectively detects the absence of any meaningful connection.

In short, the low similarity score reflects the complete lack of any visual or textual information in the image that supports or even remotely relates to the claim about Biden agreeing to a recount in the 2024 presidential election.  The image is simply unrelated to the given statement.

The low score indicates that the image provides only minimal support for the claim.

The image itself is a photograph of Elon Musk.  There's no mention of Ford, no indication of a business transaction, and nothing visually suggestive of a surprise acquisition.  The image only shows Elon Musk, likely at a Tesla facility, based on the context provided in the filename.

The reason for the weak ""Related"" classification (0.29 score) stems solely from the presence of Elon Musk. The claim involves Elon Musk and a major corporate event.  The image contains Elon Musk.  Therefore, CLIP establishes a very tenuous link based on the shared element of the subject's identity.  It's a weak association based on a single, indirect element—the person involved—not any visual evidence supporting the claim of a Ford acquisition.

The absence of any contextual clues related to Ford or any business deal drastically weakens the relationship.  The image is generically about Elon Musk, making the connection to the specific claim extremely loose and relying entirely on the name recognition of the individual.  A higher score would require visual evidence related to the acquisition, such as documents, news headlines, or Musk and Ford representatives together.  The current image offers none of this.  The low similarity score accurately reflects this lack of visual support.

We found no evidence that this photo is authentic. Biden appears to look younger in the image, suggesting it was generated by artificial intelligence.
In Pennsylvania on Sept. 11, Biden was joking with an event attendee who offered him a Trump hat. For fewer than 10 seconds, Biden accommodated the man, balancing the Trump hat over his own. The moment sparked numerous news stories and videos from news organizations including CNN, Fox News, The New York Times, the BBC, The Guardian and Reuters. 
Since the Sept. 11 instance, however, we’ve seen no reports of Biden wearing any Trump campaign gear. We contacted the White House and received no response.

The low score signifies significant discrepancies between the image content and the claim. Let's break down why:

The image shows two figures who bear a resemblance to Joe Biden and Donald Trump. However, several crucial elements contradict the claim:

* **Lack of definitive identification:** While the figures resemble Biden and Trump, the image resolution and angle aren't sufficient for certain identification.  It's plausible, but not definitively provable, that they are these individuals.  This uncertainty significantly lowers the similarity score.

* **No context indicating a meeting:** The image lacks any visual cues suggesting a formal meeting.  There's no visible setting resembling the White House interior (e.g., Oval Office), no other people present who might be aides or staff, and no indication of any interaction beyond the two figures being in proximity.

* **Ambiguous date and location:**  The image provides no textual or visual evidence confirming the date (Nov. 13) or location (White House).  This is a major factor contributing to the low similarity. CLIP relies heavily on visual and textual cues; the absence of corroborating information about the date and location heavily weighs against a high similarity score.

* **Image quality:** The image quality is relatively low. Blurred details further hinder confident identification and contextual understanding. This impacts CLIP's ability to accurately analyze the content.

* **CLIP's limitations:** CLIP is trained on vast datasets but isn't perfect.  It struggles with nuanced interpretations requiring detailed understanding of context, particularly involving political figures and events.  The low score reflects this limitation.  The model likely registered visual similarities between the figures and the named individuals but couldn't confirm the context of a meeting at the White House on a specific date based solely on the image.

In summary, the 0.36 similarity score reflects the model's recognition of *potential* visual similarities to Biden and Trump, but its inability to verify the crucial elements of the claim: the location (White House), the date (Nov. 13), and the nature of the interaction (a meeting). The lack of contextual information and the image's quality severely limit the confidence in the classification.  The relationship is weak, bordering on unrelated, despite the superficial resemblance to the described individuals.

* **Visual Content:** The image clearly depicts a flooded street. Cars are partially submerged, and the water level is high enough to suggest significant rainfall and flooding. This directly relates to the claim ""This video shows floods in Spain.""  The visual elements are consistent with the claim's subject matter.

* **Lack of Explicit Location:** The crucial weakness is the absence of any identifying markers indicating Spain.  There are no visible signs, road markings, buildings, or anything else that would confirm the location as Spain. This is the primary reason for the low similarity score.  CLIP relies on visual patterns and contextual clues; without geographic markers, it cannot confidently connect the image to Spain.

* **Generality of Flooding:** Flooding is a common natural disaster.  The image's visual characteristics of a flooded urban area are generic enough to represent flooding in many places worldwide.  This lack of specificity makes the connection weaker.

* **Similarity Score Interpretation:** A score of 0.27 is relatively low. CLIP's similarity scores are typically on a scale ranging from 0 to 1, with higher scores representing stronger relationships.  0.27 suggests a weak connection, indicating that while the image depicts flooding (consistent with the claim's subject), the lack of locational context significantly diminishes the association with Spain.

In summary, CLIP likely classified the image as ""Related"" because the visual content depicts a flood, which is directly relevant to the claim.  However, the absence of any indication of the location, coupled with the generic nature of the flood scene, results in a low similarity score reflecting the uncertainty of the image's location being Spain.  The relationship is based solely on the shared concept of ""flooding,"" without confirming geographic context.

""At 1 a.m., I was receiving calls of congratulations and based on the models, it appeared I would win the Senate race. Then, at 4 a.m., Milwaukee reported approximately 108,000 absentee ballots, with Senator Baldwin receiving nearly 90% of those ballots. Statistically, this outcome seems improbable, as it didn’t match the patterns from same-day voting in Milwaukee where I received 22% of the votes.""

These claims are inaccurate. Wisconsin election experts told PolitiFact that this early morning influx of ballots was expected — and they not only don’t signal anything nefarious, they resulted from adherence to the law. That’s because state law does not allow election workers to process absentee ballots before Election Day — despite a bipartisan push to change that law earlier this year.
The claims echo falsehoods about the 2020 election, which included the same criticisms of Milwaukee’s early-morning absentee ballot influxes.
""This is something that everybody who’s familiar with elections in Wisconsin understands will happen,"" said Jay Heck, executive director of the public advocacy group Common Cause Wisconsin.
Wisconsin is one of two swing states — and one of seven states total — that does not begin to process absentee ballots before Election Day, he said. 
The 4 a.m. influx of absentee ballots was ""only indicative"" of that, said Claire Woodall, a senior adviser at Issue One, a group advocating for transparency and clean government. 
""The ‘influx’ in the results was reflective of the number of absentee ballots that the City of Milwaukee tabulated and were known to still be outstanding at 8 p.m. on Election Night,"" she said. 
Woodall, who served as the City of Milwaukee’s Election Commission executive director from 2020 to 2024, wrote in an email that ""results from Milwaukee’s Central Count have come in between 12 a.m. and 4 a.m. every Presidential Election due to the restrictive state laws.""
Milwaukee Central Count’s high speed tabulators also do not report ""partial reports,"" so the results of the ballots counted there are ""delivered in one fell swoop,"" Woodall said.
""All results must be exported onto encrypted flash drives and hand-delivered to Milwaukee County,"" Woodall said. ""This process cannot be completed until 100% of the absentee votes have been tabulated."" 
As Milwaukee absentee ballots were tabulated Nov. 5, someone noticed that doors on the tabulator machines were not fully secured. After consulting with Republican and Democratic officials, the Milwaukee Election Commission said it would restart tabulation at central count to be ""fully transparent"" and ""to eliminate any doubt."" 
Ann Jacobs, chair of the Wisconsin Elections Commission, said in a series of Nov. 5 X posts that the tabulator machines were zeroed out and the previously tabulated ballots — about 34,000 ballots — would be rerun through the machines.

When mistakes happen, officials should ""acknowledge them, fix them"" and explain them, she wrote, adding: ""So sorry my friends, it will be a very late night here in beautiful Milwaukee."" 
A Milwaukee Election Commission statement said the city had ""no doubt regarding the integrity of the election."" As of Nov. 11, the commission’s updated statement said Milwaukee’s Board of Election Commissioners had certified the general election results. 
After Hovde mentioned Milwaukee’s 4 a.m. election results, city election officials rebutted his claims in a Nov. 11 Instagram post. 
""It is both expected and routine that absentee ballots — over 100,000 in this case — are counted and reported in the late hours of Election Night due to Wisconsin’s high voter turnout and the rigorous verification standards the MEC upholds,"" the Election Commission wrote. ""Unlike states led by both Republicans and Democrats that permit absentee ballots to be processed ahead of Election Day, Wisconsin does not, which can result in the reporting of large numbers of absentee ballots late at night."" 
The Milwaukee Election Commission called Hovde’s claims ""baseless"" and said it was ""fully confident"" that his claims lacked merit. 
Our ruling
Instagram posts claimed a 4 a.m. ""ballot dump"" in Milwaukee showed the Wisconsin U.S. Senate election was stolen from the Republican candidate.
In Wisconsin, election officials can’t process absentee ballots early, so experts say it is routine for an influx of absentee ballot votes to be reported late at night or in the early morning hours after Election Day. Because of an error noticed during tabulation, Milwaukee also tabulated more than 30,000 ballots, further delaying the city’s election results. 
Election experts rebutted claims that the 4 a.m. influx of results signaled election fraud or malfeasance.

The score of 0.29 indicates a low level of relevance, confirming this weak association.

The image shows Senator Tammy Baldwin discussing her Wisconsin Senate win.  The key elements linking this image (albeit weakly) to the claim are:

* **Tammy Baldwin's presence:**  The claim alleges election fraud affecting the Wisconsin Senate election.  Baldwin, a Democrat, was the winning candidate in that election.  The image directly depicts her, thus establishing a connection to the *event* in question, even if it doesn't address the *claim* of fraud.  This is a superficial link.

* **Implied Timeframe:** The caption under the image likely includes the date of the event, presumably around the time of the election.  The claim mentions a ""ballot dump"" around 4 a.m., suggesting a specific time during the election night counting process. Although the exact date and time are not explicitly shown in the image description, the context implies it's related to the election. This time element provides another flimsy link.

* **Absence of Direct Evidence:**  Crucially, the image shows nothing related to ballot counting, irregularities, or any evidence suggesting fraud.  It's simply a photo of a politician reacting to her win.

The low similarity score (0.29) reflects the lack of direct visual evidence.  CLIP likely made the connection based on the semantic relationship between the image's subject (Baldwin's win) and the claim's subject (the Wisconsin Senate election).  It's a connection based on context and association rather than visual similarity.  The claim focuses on specific, potentially fraudulent, actions, while the image depicts a general post-election scene.  The model identified a very loose contextual overlap, resulting in a low-confidence ""Related"" classification.  Essentially, it's associating the image with the event mentioned in the claim, not with the claim of fraud itself.

A score of 0.34 suggests a weak connection, and the analysis needs to explain why the model finds even a weak relationship.

The image shows Taylor Swift at what appears to be a public event.  She's smiling and appears to be interacting with fans or the crowd.  There's nothing in the image directly depicting tears, live television, or a reaction to a presidential election result.  The absence of these key elements is crucial.

However, the model might have established a weak link based on several indirect factors:

* **Taylor Swift's public persona:** The model has likely been trained on a massive dataset of images and text related to Taylor Swift.  It knows she's a public figure, frequently photographed at events, and has expressed opinions on political matters in the past. This pre-existing knowledge forms the basis for *any* connection.

* **Ambiguous emotional expression:** While Swift is smiling in the image, the model might not be perfectly accurate in interpreting nuanced human emotions from photographs. A subtle facial expression, not easily discernible to a human, could be misinterpreted as containing a hint of sadness or distress, weakly aligning with the ""breaking down in tears"" part of the claim.  This is a highly speculative interpretation, given the lack of any obvious distress.

* **Contextual associations:**  The model might have associated Taylor Swift's public image with potential emotional responses to significant news events, including presidential elections. This is a broader association rather than a direct link to the specific claim.

* **Limitations of CLIP:** CLIP is not perfect at understanding the context or the subtleties of human emotions. It relies on statistical correlations learned from massive datasets, and these correlations aren't always accurate or nuanced.  A low similarity score indicates the lack of strong visual overlap.

In summary, the low similarity score reflects the actual lack of visual evidence supporting the claim. The weak connection the model found is likely based on a combination of pre-existing knowledge about Taylor Swift, potentially misinterpreting subtle facial expressions, and broad contextual associations learned during training.  The image simply does not depict the event described in the claim.  The ""Related"" classification is more a reflection of the model's limitations and its broad understanding of Taylor Swift's public image than a true visual match.

At a Nov. 4 rally in North Carolina, Trump threatened to impose tariffs of 25% to 100% on Mexican imports if it didn’t stop the ""onslaught of criminals and drugs coming into our country."" Two days after Trump’s win, Nissan — which, like other major automakers, produces some of its vehicles in Mexico — announced it planned to cut jobs and reduce global production.
""Nissan just announced 9000 layoffs in Tennessee to avoid severe losses due to expected tariffs. Experts expect more,"" a Nov. 13 Threads post said.
This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.)
On Nov. 7, Nissan did announce 9,000 job cuts, but they’re not due to potential tariffs. 
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
""The announcement last week of a potential global headcount reduction had nothing to do with any proposed actions by the incoming administration,"" Nissan U.S. Corporate Communications Director Kyle Bazemore told PolitiFact in an email.
(Screenshot from Threads)
The company announced the layoffs when reporting first-half financial results for fiscal year 2024. A news release said to reduce costs by $2.6 billion, ""Nissan will cut global production capacity by 20% and reduce its global workforce by 9,000.""
The move comes after Nissan saw a drop in net revenue of 79.1 billion yen, or about $509 million. The company called it a ""severe situation"" and said CEO Makoto Uchida will take a 50% pay cut, in addition to the job and production cuts.
Nissan has been struggling, in part, because it doesn’t have an offering in the surging U.S. gasoline-electric hybrid market, Uchida said. 
The news release did not mention possible tariffs as a factor, nor did company executives attribute them to tariffs in a Nov. 7 news conference. 
Uchida did respond to a question about the effect of possible Trump-imposed tariffs. ""Not only us, but many carmakers are using Mexican production, so we would like to do a lot of lobbying efforts,"" he said. He said the company exported 300,000 models from Mexico to the U.S. this fiscal year and that the company would ""monitor carefully"" what is happening with tariffs.
Nikkei, a Japan-based financial news outlet, reported that Japanese automakers are preparing to spend more on lobbying in the U.S. with Trump in charge. Nissan, Honda and Toyota together spent 25% more on lobbying in Trump’s first term, compared with former President Barack Obama’s last term.
William Reinsch, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ economics program, said a massive layoff would be premature because Trump hasn’t taken office and tariffs have not taken effect.
""Trump has proven himself unpredictable, so it is hard to say what he might actually do once in office, but I don’t think it’s realistic to assume Nissan initiated a layoff that size purely on speculation about possible tariffs,"" Reinsch said.

Neither the news release nor Nissan executives have specified where the 9,000 cuts to global headcount would come from.
Bazemore also did not specify if the layoffs would affect workers in Tennessee, home to Nissan’s North American headquarters. Nissan has two production sites in the state. A Smyrna plant makes the Nissan Maxima, Leaf, Pathfinder, Rogue, Murano and the Infiniti QX60, Nissan’s website said. Another plant in Decherd produces engine parts.
Bazemore said the U.S. is a priority market for Nissan, and ""we expect an increase in sales from all-new models, including the Nissan Kicks, Murano, Armada and Infiniti QX80.""
While Nissan’s Murano is produced in Tennessee, the Kicks subcompact SUV is manufactured in Mexico, and the Armada and QX80 are produced in Japan. 
Nissan also makes the Sentra and Versa in Mexico, where it produced more than 615,000 light vehicles in 2023. It exported about 367,000 of those that year.
Our ruling
A Threads post claimed Nissan is planning 9,000 layoffs in Tennessee because of Trump’s proposed tariffs. 
A company spokesperson said the layoffs and production cuts announced two days after the U.S. election are not related to possible Trump policy. The company is cutting costs after a severe sales slump. It’s unclear where the job cuts would be made, but the company described them as global and not specific to Tennessee.

But this Sephora claim is all made up. A company spokesperson told PolitiFact in an email that ""Sephora does not make corporate donations to political candidates. Sephora’s mission is to create a welcoming beauty shopping experience for all.""
The Federal Election Campaign Act forbids corporations from donating directly to federal candidates, according to the Federal Election Commision.
Corporations may set up political action committees, through which they can donate to candidates. But OpenSecrets, a nonprofit group tracking contributions to U.S. political campaigns, shows no record of Sephora or its parent company, LVMH, making political action committee donations to support Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris.

The low similarity score of 0.28 from CLIP reflects this lack of direct connection.

The classification as ""Related"" with such a low score is likely due to a tenuous, indirect association made by CLIP.  The connection is purely contextual:

* **Sephora is a prominent retailer:** The image shows a recognizable Sephora store. CLIP might have associated Sephora with the broader context of political donations and corporate involvement in campaigns, which are often discussed in the news.
* **Trump's campaign:** The claim mentions Trump's campaign, a topic frequently depicted visually in media.  CLIP might recognize the general category of ""political campaign imagery"" as related, even without explicit visual ties to Trump himself or any donation information.

However, there is no visual evidence in the image to support the claim of a large donation.  The photo itself is a generic storefront; it shows no logos, banners, or any other visual indicators linking Sephora to the Trump campaign or political donations. Therefore, the ""Related"" classification is a weak association based on broader contextual understanding rather than any direct visual representation of the claim.  The low similarity score correctly reflects this weak link.

A score of 0.29 indicates a weak relationship, suggesting the model is hesitant about the connection.  Let's analyze why:

The image (from Fox News) shows a picture of Donald Trump speaking to a crowd.  Several factors contribute to the low similarity score despite the obvious presence of Trump:

* **Lack of Specificity:** The image is generic. It doesn't show a specific location, a date, or any signage indicating a post-2024 election rally *in the UK*.  The claim explicitly mentions a post-2024 UK rally—details completely absent from the image.  The image only shows Trump addressing a crowd, a common occurrence.  The model likely penalizes the lack of crucial details matching the claim.

* **Ambiguous Context:** The image lacks any textual or visual context explicitly placing the rally in the UK *after* the 2024 election. The crowd could be anywhere.  The attire of the crowd doesn't offer any geographical clues.  The model needs strong visual cues to support the specific claim.

* **Low Resolution and Quality:** The image quality might also be a contributing factor.  Lower resolution images provide less detail for CLIP to process accurately.  This can affect the confidence in identifying specific elements and relationships.

* **CLIP's Limitations:** CLIP is a powerful model but not perfect. It relies on correlating visual features with textual descriptions from its training data. It might not have encountered many images of Trump rallies in the UK in its training set, making it less confident in establishing the connection, even when the primary subject (Trump) is present. The low score reflects this uncertainty.

In summary, while the image depicts Donald Trump addressing a crowd (relevant to the claim's subject), the lack of contextual information—specifically the location (UK) and timeframe (post-2024 election)—is the primary reason for the low similarity score.  The model rightly flags the image as weakly related due to the insufficient evidence to confirm the claim's specific details.  The score reflects the model's cautious approach to avoid false positives.  A higher-resolution image showing UK flags, banners mentioning the 2024 election, or other specific location/date markers would dramatically increase the similarity score.

There were six counties across the Badger State where Harris’ share of the vote this year was greater than Biden’s share of the vote in 2020, and two more in which their share of the vote was the same. Those include: 
Brown County, where both Harris and Biden received 45.5% of the vote 
Door County, where Harris received 50.6% of the vote to Biden’s 49.9% 
Eau Claire County, where Harris received 54.5% of the vote to Biden’s 54.3%
Manitowoc County, where Harris received 37.6% of the vote to Biden’s 37.5%
Ozaukee County, where Harris received 43.9% of the vote to Biden’s 43.2% 
Taylor County, where both Harris and Biden received 25.2% of the vote

Washington County, where Harris received 31.2% of the vote to Biden’s 30.2%
Waukesha County, where Harris received 39.3% of the vote to Biden’s 38.8% 
There were some counties where Harris received more raw votes than Biden did in 2020, but a lower share of the vote total. That may have happened because of votes for third-party candidates, or because the county population grew in the last four years — such as in Dane County, in which Harris received almost 14,000 more votes than Biden, but captured 75.1% of the vote to Biden’s 75.7%.
As such, we’ll keep this analysis to counties where Harris’ vote share outperformed or matched Biden’s. 
And while she only did so in eight out of Wisconsin’s 72 counties, that proves wrong Vos’ assertion that she did worse than Biden in ""every single county in America."" 
There are also other examples across the country — according to a Nov. 6 New York Times analysis, nationally, about 10% of counties had shifted more Democratic since 2020. (Some Western states were still counting votes then, too.) 
Our ruling
Vos claimed that ""every single county in America, every single county, Kamala Harris did worse than Joe Biden did."" 
An analysis of the 2020 and 2024 election results in Wisconsin alone shows he’s wrong — Harris received a greater share of the vote than Biden did in six of 72 counties, and matched his share of the vote in two others. 
We rate this claim False.",FALSE,image_208.jpg,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/kamala_harris_speaks_in_wisconsin_july_23_24/b3c1f127f92a231429b97325f4069187.jpg,Related,0.2880498170852661,"The image shows Kamala Harris speaking at a political event.  The claim, ""Every single county in America, every single county, Kamala Harris did worse than Joe Biden did,"" is a statement about her performance relative to Joe Biden in terms of electoral support, presumably in a specific election.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a low similarity score of 0.29 indicates a weak connection between the image and the claim.  This low score is crucial; it suggests the connection is tenuous at best.

Here's why the relationship is weak:

* **Lack of Explicit Data:** The image provides no information about election results at the county level. It doesn't show any vote tallies, maps, or charts comparing Harris's and Biden's performance.  It simply shows Harris speaking.

* **Contextual Absence:** The image lacks context linking it specifically to an election where such a comparison could be made. We don't know which election the claim refers to, making it impossible to assess whether the image depicts a moment relevant to the claim's assertion.  Even if the speech was given during or after an election, it doesn't inherently mean the statement is accurate.

* **Generic Nature of the Image:**  The image is a standard political photo – a politician speaking to a crowd.  Such images are easily associated with various political claims, regardless of accuracy. The generality of the image contributes to the low similarity score.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The 0.29 score itself emphasizes the weak connection.  CLIP likely identified a very loose semantic relationship based on the presence of Kamala Harris, a key figure in the claim. However, the lack of visual evidence supporting the claim significantly lowers the score.

In summary, the CLIP model's ""Related"" classification is based solely on the presence of Kamala Harris in the image.  However, the lack of any data related to the claim's specific assertion (county-level election results) and the low similarity score strongly suggest that the connection is superficial and doesn't lend any support to the truthfulness of the claim.  The image is simply irrelevant to verifying the accuracy of the claim.

The claim focuses on a specific online activity—a cessation of posting on a social media platform.  The image, being classified as unrelated, almost certainly contains none of the following:

* **Visual Representations of the Companies/Celebrities:** No logos for Disney, Marvel, Warner Bros., or any other relevant entities are present.
* **Mention of X (formerly Twitter):** The text in the image does not mention X, Twitter, or any social media platform relevant to the claim.
* **Data about Social Media Activity:** There's no data visualization (graphs, charts, etc.) showing declining posting activity on a platform like X.
* **News Headline about Social Media Blackout:** The headline (if there is one visible) does not pertain to companies and celebrities halting their social media presence on X.


In essence, the image contains visual and textual information entirely unrelated to the core subject of the claim – the specific action of 21 companies and celebrities stopping their posts on X. The low similarity score reflects the absence of any visual or textual overlap between the image's content and the assertion made in the claim. The model correctly identifies that the image's subject matter is completely different from the claim.

The claim, ""It was just Biden and Trump in 2020 general election ballots,"" is demonstrably false.  Therefore, the CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.34 is likely due to a combination of factors:

* **Contextual Relationship:**  The image directly refutes the claim.  While not a perfect match (a ""perfect"" match would require an image explicitly showing the claim being false), the image is highly relevant to the claim's veracity. CLIP understands the semantic relationship between the image content and the text claim, even if it doesn't perfectly align with the claim's assertion.

* **Visual Elements and Text:** The image clearly shows a ballot with multiple candidates listed, directly contradicting the statement that only Biden and Trump were options.  The presence of other names, even if not fully legible, provides enough visual evidence for CLIP to link it to the claim's falsity.  The visual representation of a ballot, containing choices beyond the two named, is the key element creating the relationship.

* **Moderate Similarity Score (0.34):** The relatively low similarity score (0.34) indicates that the relationship isn't a strong one.  This is understandable.  The image doesn't explicitly say ""This claim is false,"" but rather provides evidence contradicting it.  The low score reflects the indirect nature of the relationship: the image *implies* the falsity of the claim rather than directly stating it.

* **CLIP Limitations:** CLIP is a large language and image model. It excels at finding visual and textual correlations but may struggle with nuanced relationships, particularly those requiring sophisticated logical reasoning. It directly compares visual features and textual descriptions; it doesn't ""understand"" the claim in the same way a human does. The relatively low score reflects this limitation.  It sees the ballot, sees the names, sees the claim, and finds a weak correlation.

In summary, the ""Related"" classification stems from the image's visual content directly contradicting the claim's assertion.  While not a perfect match, the image provides strong counter-evidence, resulting in a weak but relevant connection identified by CLIP. The low similarity score reflects the indirect nature of this relationship and the inherent limitations of CLIP in fully understanding and interpreting complex factual claims.

The white flag mentioned in the claim is a sign of surrender during war and not flown by Buckingham Palace. The monarch’s official residence flies the Royal Standard flag only when the king is at the palace. The Union Jack, the U.K.’s official flag, flies over the palace when the king is absent.

The similarity score of 0.25 from CLIP suggests a weak, tenuous connection between the claim and the image, and this is justifiable.

The provided image shows a relatively normal scene at Buckingham Palace. It depicts a portion of the building, likely during daylight hours, with no visible signs of unrest, violence, or a raised white flag. There's no visible text related to the death or overthrow of the King. The scene is peaceful and lacks any element suggesting a dramatic end to the King's reign.

The weak correlation (0.25) likely stems from CLIP associating the image with several keywords individually present in the claim:

* **Buckingham Palace:**  The image clearly shows Buckingham Palace, providing a direct link.
* **Flag:** While no white flag is visible, the image does show flags in general, potentially triggering a weak association with the concept of a flag within the CLIP model.  However, this is a very loose connection and not indicative of a ""white flag of surrender.""
* **King Charles:** Although not explicitly shown in the image, the context surrounding Buckingham Palace inherently connects it to the monarchy and King Charles. This is an indirect and weak connection.

However, the crucial element missing—a white flag raised as a sign of surrender—completely undermines the dramatic claim.  The image's peaceful nature strongly contradicts the assertion of the headline.  The low similarity score accurately reflects this significant mismatch between the image content and the dramatic narrative presented in the claim. The model correctly recognizes Buckingham Palace, but fails to find the key elements that would make the headline plausible.  The low score shows that the model doesn't make a false positive; it understands the image doesn't support the claim's extreme narrative.

The relatively low similarity score of 0.27 between the image and the claim ""Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are 'part of the World Economic Forum'"" indicates a weak relationship, as determined by the CLIP model.  This is because the image directly contradicts a portion of the claim.

While the image contains both Elon Musk's name and a reference to the World Economic Forum (WEF), it explicitly refutes the assertion that Musk is a part of it.  The presence of Musk's name and ""WEF"" alone isn't enough to establish a strong positive relationship, especially when the content of the image conveys the opposite.

The CLIP model likely assigned a 'Related' classification, despite the contradiction, due to the presence of the shared entities: Elon Musk and the WEF. The model identifies these keywords and links them, regardless of the context. The low similarity score, however, reflects the significant semantic difference between the claim's assertion and Musk's explicit denial in the tweet depicted in the image. The score quantifies the model's hesitation in strongly associating the image with the claim due to the direct contradiction present within the image itself.  Essentially, the model recognizes the components of the claim but weighs the direct counter-evidence heavily, resulting in a low similarity score and a weaker 'Related' classification rather than a stronger positive association.

The map is a clue that this isn’t real news: Several states Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, won that are typically shown in blue appear red. 
Beyoncé’s Renaissance World Tour ended October 2023. She hasn’t announced new tour dates. 
We rate this post False.",FALSE,image_213.jpg,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/fvrrd1kn/production/52b92ba51da72167c37cf589d1350d4e50073eef-1599x1493.jpg,Related,0.2639928758144378,"The image URL provided shows a stylized graphic featuring Beyoncé's face superimposed onto a map of the United States.  The map is primarily shaded in red, representing Republican-leaning ""red states,"" with a few blue areas representing Democratic-leaning ""blue states.""  Beyoncé's face is positioned somewhat centrally but leans slightly toward the blue areas. The overall aesthetic is bold and somewhat confrontational.


The claim, ""Beyoncé excludes red states from tour, ‘This isn’t my America,’” suggests that Beyoncé is deliberately avoiding performing in states that are politically conservative.  The low similarity score of 0.26 from CLIP indicates a weak relationship between the image and the claim, despite a superficial thematic connection.


Here's why the relationship is weak, despite CLIP finding a *relatedness*:

* **Indirect Representation:** The image doesn't explicitly show Beyoncé *excluding* red states.  It depicts a visual metaphor suggesting a potential political divide or alienation from red states, but not concrete evidence of tour cancellations. The red coloring of the map *implies* a possible connection to the claim, but it's a visual interpretation, not a direct depiction.

* **Lack of Explicit Text:** The image contains no text directly stating that Beyoncé is boycotting red states.  The claim relies on external information not present in the visual.

* **Ambiguity of the Visual:**  The graphic's aesthetic could be interpreted in multiple ways. It could be seen as commentary on political polarization, a representation of perceived alienation, or even an artistic expression unrelated to Beyoncé's tour choices.  The ambiguity reduces the direct relationship to the claim.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The 0.26 score is quite low. CLIP is indicating a very weak semantic relationship.  It likely picked up on the shared concept of ""Beyoncé"" and ""United States,"" which are present in both the image and the claim, but failed to establish a strong connection between the implied boycott (in the claim) and the implied political division (in the image).


In summary, while the image and the claim both deal with Beyoncé and a geographic representation of the United States, the image's indirect and ambiguous representation of the supposed boycott prevents a strong connection.  The low CLIP similarity score reflects this lack of a strong, direct link between the visual and the textual claim.  The connection is mostly thematic and inferential, not explicitly visual.

The Harris campaign paid Winfrey’s production company for the cost of hosting a Sept. 19 ""Unite for America"" rally at which Winfrey interviewed Harris. But Winfrey said she did not receive a personal fee for the interview.
In a TMZ video, a reporter asks Winfrey whether it’s ""true that they paid you a million dollars for the endorsement for Kamala?"" Winfrey responds, ""Not true. I was paid nothing — ever.""

A Harpo Productions spokesperson told Variety in a statement, ""The campaign paid for the production costs of ‘Unite for America,’ a live-streaming event that took place Sept. 19 outside Detroit, Mich. Oprah Winfrey was at no point during the campaign paid a personal fee, nor did she receive a fee from Harpo.""
PolitiFact contacted a Winfrey spokesperson about the claim but received no immediate response.
Megan Thee Stallion performed at a July rally for Harris in Atlanta and rapper Eminem spoke  supporting Harris in October in Detroit. Neither the artists nor their production companies were listed in Harris’ campaign finance records.
The statement has an element of truth — the Harris campaign paid Oprah’s company $1 million for hosting an event. But the claim ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

The similarity score of 0.31 between the claim and the image, while not high, is understandable given CLIP's functionality.  The relatively low score reflects the nuanced difference between the *claim* and the *image's depiction of the claim's falsity*.

Here's a breakdown of why CLIP classified the image as 'Related':

* **Shared Subject Matter:** Both the claim and the image directly refer to Kamala Harris's campaign and the alleged payments to Oprah, Megan Thee Stallion, and Eminem.  This shared core subject matter is the primary reason for the relationship.

* **Keyword Overlap:**  The names ""Oprah,"" ""Megan Thee Stallion,"" ""Eminem,"" and ""Kamala Harris"" appear in both the claim and the image's headline.  CLIP likely identifies these keyword matches as indicators of relevance.

* **Semantic Relationship:**  While the claim asserts the payments *occurred*, the image demonstrates that the claim is *false*.  CLIP doesn't grasp the semantic nuance of the truth value; it only detects the presence of the key entities and concepts involved.  The fact that the image refutes the claim doesn't negate the relationship; it merely adds a layer of context that CLIP doesn't fully process.

* **Low Similarity Score Explanation:** The low similarity score (0.31) reflects the crucial difference between assertion and refutation.  The image actively contradicts the claim.  If the image had simply stated the payments *without* a fact-check label, the similarity score would likely be much higher.

In summary, CLIP identifies the relationship based on the overlapping entities and keywords.  It doesn't fully understand the semantic opposition between the claim and the image's fact-check conclusion, resulting in a relatively low, but still positive, similarity score.  The relationship is based on shared subject matter, not on agreement of truth value.

The Threads post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)
The post sought to tie the incoming Trump administration to Project 2025, a sweeping policy proposal the Heritage Foundation produced for a Republican administration. A video in the post played a clip of Rubio speaking at the conservative think tank.
But the post inaccurately describes what Rubio said in the clip, and ignores that Rubio was speaking to the group in 2015 — eight years before Project 2025 was published.

(Screenshot from Threads)
In the Threads video, Rubio said, ""Thank you to Heritage for inviting us here, giving us an opportunity, and for all the scholarship that they do here. That really serves as a guidepost for a lot of the public policy we choose to make.""
He did not mention Project 2025, nor did he in the full video of the April 15, 2015, event, at which Rubio joined fellow Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, to discuss tax reform. 
Rubio could not have mentioned Project 2025 in 2015 because the plan wasn’t published until April 2023. The video also shows a ""Road to the White House 2016"" logo. (Two days earlier, Rubio had announced his own presidential run, which he would later end in March 2016 after Trump beat him in the Florida Republican primary.) 
Vice President Kamala Harris and Democrats similarly tried to make Project 2025 a major campaign issue and tried to tie it to Trump.
Trump sought to distance himself from Project 2025 during the campaign, calling some parts of the plan ""ridiculous."" The New York Times reported that about 175 former Trump administration officials and advisers helped write the plan, and some of its policy proposals, such as eliminating the Education Department, mirror Trump’s.

Videos show that President Donald Trump admitted to rigging the 2024 election during his preinauguration day rally.
By Loreben Tuquero • January 21, 2025
Trump so far has named Tom Homan, formerly his acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement director, as his ""border czar."" Homan, a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation, is listed as one of dozens of Project 2025 contributors.
A CBS News analysis of Project 2025 found more than 700 specific policy proposals. Its review found that at least 270 matched Trump’s past policies or recent campaign promises.
Project 2025 calls for extensive overhauls in the executive branch and draws on long-held conservative principles, such as tax cuts that Trump has agreed with or may agree with. Trump, on his own, published a less specific agenda during his 2024 presidential campaign.
When asked about Project 2025 in a July CNN interview, Rubio said he likes the Heritage Foundation and some things it stands for. But he described Project 2025 as a think tank’s work, not as something speaking for Trump.
There may be some overlap between Project 2025 and the policies Trump will seek to enact, but the claim that this 2015 video shows Rubio ""admitting"" that Trump will lean heavily on the plan is False.

The relatively low similarity score of 0.30 from CLIP suggests a weak visual connection between the image and the claim ""Video shows Marco Rubio ‘admitting the Trump Presidency will lean heavily into the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 plans.’""  This low score is justifiable considering the following:

* **Lack of Explicit Textual Evidence:** The image itself contains no visible text referencing ""Heritage Foundation,"" ""Project 2025,"" or any explicit admission by Rubio about the Trump presidency leaning on those plans.  The claim relies on the *content* of the video, not anything visually apparent in the still image.

* **Generic Context:** The image only shows Rubio speaking.  His expression is neutral; there's nothing in his body language or the setting that directly supports or refutes the claim.  It's a standard shot of a politician giving a statement, which is visually unremarkable and doesn't offer any specific clues about the topic of his speech.

* **Inference Required:** To determine the validity of the claim, one must rely entirely on the *audio* component of the video, which is absent from the still image.  CLIP, being a visual model, cannot process audio.  Therefore, the 'Related' classification is based solely on the presence of Rubio, the subject of the claim.

* **Similarity Score as a Measure of Visual Similarity:** The similarity score of 0.30 indicates a weak visual relationship.  This reflects that the image alone doesn't provide much evidence related to the core elements of the claim (Heritage Foundation, Project 2025, admission).  A higher score would indicate a stronger visual correspondence, such as showing a document mentioning Project 2025 or Rubio explicitly gesturing towards relevant written material.


In summary, the CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a low similarity score accurately reflects the limited visual information provided by the still image. The image only shows Rubio speaking, offering no visual evidence to support or contradict the claim's core assertion.  The relationship is weak because the claim hinges on the *audio* content of the video, which the image cannot convey.  The classification is based on the presence of Rubio, the subject of the claim, but the lack of any other relevant visual elements results in the low similarity score.

This score reflects the ambiguity and lack of direct visual evidence supporting the claim. Let's break down why:

The image depicts a conceptual design of a Tesla-branded electric bicycle.  Key visual elements include:

* **Tesla Branding:** The bike clearly displays the Tesla logo, strongly associating it with the brand.  This is a major factor contributing to the ""Related"" classification.  The claim mentions Tesla, and the image shows a Tesla bike, hence a basic level of semantic relevance.

* **E-bike Features:** The bike is depicted as an electric bicycle, featuring what appears to be a battery pack integrated into the frame.  This aligns with the ""e-bike"" element of the claim.

* **Design Concept:** Importantly, the image is clearly a *rendering* or *concept art*. It doesn't show a real, manufactured product ready for release.  This is crucial because the claim suggests an *immediate* release of a $1,000 e-bike.  The image provides no information about pricing or availability.

* **Lack of Contextual Information:** The image contains no text or elements suggesting a price point of $1000 or a specific release date.


Therefore, the relatively low similarity score (0.30) is justifiable. While the image visually aligns with parts of the claim (Tesla branding and e-bike features), it lacks crucial details to strongly support the claim of an immediate $1000 release announced by Elon Musk. The conceptual nature of the image, the absence of pricing, and the lack of any evidence of an actual announcement contribute to the weak connection.  The model likely identifies the thematic overlap (Tesla e-bike) but flags the discrepancy between the claim's assertion of immediate release and the image's depiction of a mere concept.  A higher score would require the image to show a real product, ideally with pricing or a release date mentioned.

The image contains:

The claim, on the other hand, directly refers to a specific news organization (CBS News) reporting on a serious allegation (election cheating).  This is a highly charged political statement with implications for democratic processes and public trust.

The low similarity score (0.16) reflects the complete semantic and visual disconnect between the two. CLIP, as a multimodal model, compares the visual features of the image with the semantic representation of the text.

Let's break down why the score is low despite some relevance:

**Elements supporting a weak connection:**

* **Cleared Account Implied:** The image shows only a small portion of the Instagram page. While it doesn't explicitly show a completely cleared account, the fact that only three videos are visible suggests *some* content removal, aligning slightly with the ""cleared"" part of the claim.  However, this is a weak connection because it doesn't prove a complete clearing.

* **Presence of Videos:** The image shows three video thumbnails, which aligns with the claim's mention of ""3 videos.""  This is a stronger connection than the ""cleared"" aspect.

* **No Snake Confirmation:** Crucially, the image *does not* show any indication that the videos are of snakes.  The thumbnails are unclear and provide no visual confirmation of the claim's content. This significantly weakens the relationship.

**Elements contradicting a strong connection:**

* **Lack of Context:** The image provides no context about the videos' content or their cryptic nature.  The claim suggests a cryptic message, but the image offers no visual clues supporting this.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The 0.30 similarity score from CLIP is quite low.  This suggests a limited overlap between the visual content of the image and the semantic content of the claim.  In the world of image-text similarity, 0.30 is closer to unrelated than related.  CLIP likely found some minimal overlap (videos, Instagram profile) but weighted it as not very strong evidence.

**In summary:**

The CLIP model likely classified the image as ""Related"" due to the presence of three video thumbnails on what appears to be a partially cleared Instagram profile, aligning with some aspects of the claim.  However, the crucial lack of visual evidence of snakes, the absence of context regarding cryptic messaging, and the low similarity score all point to a weak and tenuous connection.  The image provides only minimal circumstantial support for the claim, making the ""Related"" classification with a low score justifiable.  A higher score would require visual confirmation of the snake videos.

Studies have consistently shown that ballot tabulating machines — the machines that receive paper ballots and electronically count the votes — are more accurate than hand-counting in large numbers. The machines are tested for accuracy before the election, and results are audited in nearly every state. 
What’s more, most voters in the U.S. already use hand-marked paper ballots to cast their votes. 
The Diamond and Silk account didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Is hand-counting ballots reliable? 
Hand-counting paper ballots is tedious, time-consuming and prone to human error. 
A 2004 Massachusetts Institute of Technology study examined the variance in vote totals in New Hampshire recounts between hand-counting and machine tabulating. The study found that machine tabulation had a significantly lower variance between the initial count and the recount than hand-counting, meaning the machines were more accurate. 
A 2007 Rice University study tested the accuracy of hand-counting 120 ballots in two races with predetermined results. The participants accurately counted the two races 58% of the time. 
Hand-counting ballots is also expensive and time-constraining for local election officials, especially when ballots can include dozens of races. 
A 2023 study by Arizona’s Mohave County Elections Department found that hand-counting the 2024 general election results would require 245 people working 19 eight-hour days, which would cost about $521,000. Accounting for other expenses such as security guards, cameras and additional staff, the study estimated hand-counts for both the 2024 primary and general elections would cost the county $1.1 million. 
When accounting for human error, it’s wrong to say that hand-counting ""never breaks down,"" as it’s shown to be less reliable than machine counting.
Voting systems are tested stringently before they’re used in elections. Election officials use test ballots to ensure machine counts are accurate and to identify errors.

It’s an exaggeration to say voting machines ""always break down"" on Election Day, even if some counties run into errors. Each of the more than 3,000 counties in the U.S. has its own set of laws and voting systems to conduct elections, meaning errors sometimes happen. 
But voting in the 2024 election went relatively smoothly, and most counties used ballot tabulating machines problem-free.
The machine-counted results are also often verified after the election through audits. Every state but Alabama conducts some type of postelection audit, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Most often, this involves hand-counting a small percentage of the ballots to compare them with the machine-tabulated results. 
The post also ignores that paper ballots are widely used in U.S. elections; most U.S. voters already mark candidate preferences using paper ballots, which machine tabulators then count.
Verified Voting, a nonpartisan organization focused on election technology, said close to 70% of U.S. voters live in jurisdictions in which hand-marked paper ballots are the norm. An extra 25% use electronic ballot marking devices, in which voters mark their choices on a machine that prints a paper ballot. And 5% use direct recording electronic systems, which record selections directly into computer memory.
Our ruling
A Diamond and Silk Instagram post said ""paper ballots and hand counting never breaks down."" 
Hand-counting is prone to human error, as ballot counters can misread choices or accidentally record the wrong result. Ballot tabulating machines are tested for high accuracy and have a far lower error rate than hand-counting. 
Although there were isolated incidents of machine malfunctions during the 2024 election, the vast majority of voting systems worked as intended.

It depicts a large room filled with numerous people, many appearing to be election workers, surrounded by what looks like stacks of ballots or ballot boxes. The scene is busy and disorganized, implying a potentially stressful and inefficient process.

The claim ""Paper ballots and hand counting never breaks down"" asserts that a system using paper ballots and manual counting is entirely reliable and invulnerable to failure.  The image, however, visually contradicts this assertion. The visual clutter, the sheer number of people involved, and the general impression of disorganization suggest that even a hand-counting process involving paper ballots can experience logistical challenges, delays, and potential breakdowns.  This breakdown isn't necessarily a failure of the *process* of hand counting itself, but rather a breakdown in the *logistics* of managing a large-scale hand count.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.27 is low, reflecting the weak visual connection.  It's not a strong correlation. The image doesn't directly show a *failure* of hand-counting (e.g., lost ballots, miscounting) but rather shows the *potential* for such failures due to the chaotic environment.  The low similarity score indicates that while the image depicts a potentially problematic aspect of a large-scale hand count, it doesn't directly and visually demonstrate the *complete breakdown* claimed to be impossible in the statement.  The visual elements suggest the *possibility* of breakdown, not its inherent impossibility.  The model likely picked up on the keywords ""ballots"" and ""counting"" in relation to the context of the claim, but the overall scene's chaotic nature, while relevant to the claim's implied reliability, wasn't a strong enough visual match to yield a high similarity score.

The headline prominently features the phrase ""FALSE: 2,038 Suicides Reported After Trump's Election.""  The article text visible in the screenshot likely provides details debunking the claim of 2,038 suicides following Trump's election.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.29, while seemingly low, is understandable given the context.  The low score likely reflects the fact that the image doesn't directly *show* 2,038 suicides or any evidence directly supporting the original claim.  Instead, the image refutes the claim.

The relationship is one of **contradiction or rebuttal**.  The original claim asserts a specific number of suicides following a specific event.  The image showcases a news article explicitly labeling that claim as FALSE.  CLIP, therefore, recognizes a semantic connection between the claim and the image, even though the connection is one of opposition.  The image is relevant to the claim because it addresses and disputes it directly.

The relatively low similarity score (0.29) suggests that the direct textual overlap isn't high enough to trigger a stronger ""Related"" classification.  CLIP might be relying more on contextual understanding than exact keyword matching. It understands the common element – the number ""2038 suicides"" and the event ""Trump's election"" –  but the overall semantic relationship is one of disagreement, hence the relatively low score despite the clear relevance.  A higher score would likely require a more direct visual representation of the original claim, rather than a refutation of it.

The relatively low similarity score of 0.30 from CLIP suggests a weak relationship between the image and the claim. This is understandable considering several factors:

* **Lack of Explicit Context:** The image itself doesn't contain any text explicitly mentioning impeachment or Donald Trump's potential election.  It's simply a picture of Pelosi speaking. The claim requires contextual information about the *content* of her speech, which the image alone cannot provide.

* **Visual Ambiguity:** While the image shows Pelosi, her expression and the surrounding environment offer no clues about the specific topic of her address.  She could be discussing anything. The visual information is insufficient to corroborate or refute the claim.

* **CLIP's Limitations:** CLIP's strength lies in associating images with textual concepts.  However, it struggles with nuanced relationships, especially those requiring understanding of spoken language and political contexts. The connection is based on the visual presence of Pelosi, linking her to the claim, but it doesn't grasp the semantic meaning of the claim itself.

* **The ""Related"" Classification:** The 0.30 score falls in a range indicating a weak or tenuous relationship.  CLIP likely classified it as ""Related"" simply because Pelosi is prominently featured in the image, and the claim mentions her. This is a superficial connection, lacking a deeper semantic understanding. A higher score would indicate a stronger visual corroboration of the claim’s content.

In summary, the image provides only the visual element of Nancy Pelosi, which is tenuously related to the claim.  The absence of any textual or contextual clues within the image concerning impeachment or Donald Trump results in a low similarity score. The classification is based on a simple visual association rather than a comprehensive understanding of the claim's meaning and the image's context.  To verify the claim, one needs a transcript or reliable reporting of Pelosi's actual statement, not just a photograph of her speaking.

One Nov. 7 Instagram post shared a screengrab of an X post that contained a graphic showing the partisan breakdown of wins in a number of swing states.

Trump, the graphic showed, had won or was winning the battleground states of Arizona, Michigan, Nevada,  North Carolina and Wisconsin, but Democratic Senate candidates (or in North Carolina, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate) had won or were winning their contests in those states.
""What are the odds of this happening in 5 of the swing states?"" words in the screengrab said. ""Honest question. And not all Senate incumbents either."" 
""Something stinks,"" the Instagram user wrote in response. ""This doesn’t make any sense.""
(Screengrab from Instagram)

The post has accurately described the results as they sat by midday Nov. 8, three days postelection. Although these results may not make sense at first glance, they happened for several reasons.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
Voters have free will. Presidential and Senate votes tend to align; in most 2024 Senate races, the same party did win both contests in the same state. But there’s a long-standing phenomenon known as ticket-splitting, in which voters may choose a Democrat for one office and a Republican for another. 
Ticket splitting has become less common in recent election cycles as partisan polarization has increased. In 2016, every Senate race went to the same party as the presidential race did, and in 2020, only Maine voters split their ticket in voting for Republican Sen. Susan Collins and for Joe Biden for president. But the practice hasn’t disappeared entirely.
In gubernatorial races, states such as Kansas, Kentucky, New Hampshire, Nevada, North Carolina and Virginia have chosen a governor of a different party than the presidential choice in the most recent election. And, in the current Congress, more than two dozen U.S. House members represent districts that the other party won in 2020.
Candidates matter. Voters split tickets because elections are a choice between candidates, not just between parties. Incumbency can help candidates; so can a lack of controversy, or a bigger war chest for campaign ads or a better-run campaign.
Two of the Senate races on the list cited in the post had incumbents prevail (or had them on track to prevail, pending additional ballot counting): Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin and Jacky Rosen of Nevada. Their achievements in office and voters’ familiarity may have helped these candidates. Some voters may have wanted to send a message on inflation in the presidential race but decided that the Senate has less to do with economic conditions than the president does.
Meanwhile, in North Carolina’s gubernatorial race, Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein faced Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, a Republican candidate who faced a flurry of revelations about his past controversial comments on race and sex. Robinson won about 40% of the vote in a state in which generic Republican candidates for statewide office can usually count on 50% or better.
And in Arizona, Republican Kari Lake came to voters’ attention in 2022 when she lost a gubernatorial race built heavily on claims that elections are fraudulent, including the presidential race that Biden won. This year, she lost to Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, a retired U.S. Marine and a Latino in a campaign year in which Latino voters were pivotal within the electorate.
Don’t sleep on third parties and nonvotes. In the four Senate-race split decisions, the margins were narrow. In these four states, the Democratic Senate candidates won (or are winning) by 17,000 to 44,000 votes; in Nevada, Michigan and Wisconsin, Harris lost (or is losing) by between 29,000 and 82,000 votes. Arizona was wider at 155,000.
With such small margins, other factors can figure in election results if you run the math.

In these states’ Senate races, third-party candidates received from 39,000 to 170,000 votes; in the presidential race, their haul ranged from 25,000 to 110,000.
Also, some people voted for president but not for a Senate candidate, and may have skipped other down-ballot races. Depending on the state, from 18,000 to 72,000 voters did this, according to PolitiFact’s calculations from The New York Times’ running election results page. If these Senate race-skippers consisted disproportionately of Trump voters, that by itself could have kept some of these Republican Senate candidates from winning.
Then there’s Nevada’s eccentric ballot option,""none of these candidates."" In the presidential race, about 18,000 voters chose this option; in the Senate race, more than 40,000 did. The number of ""none of these candidates"" voters in the Senate race is more than twice as large as Rosen’s current lead.
A nontrivial share of voters chose to back a third-party candidate or decline to choose anyone in the U.S. Senate race. In some or all of these states, that could have spelled the difference between victory and defeat. 
Our ruling
Social media posts said ""something stinks"" that Trump won in several battleground states while Democrats won Senate or governor races in those states.
Although there’s a strong historical correlation between votes cast for president and senator, it’s not ironclad. Voters are free to choose candidates of different parties for different offices, and some fraction of voters does so.
In each of these races, the Democrats benefited from an advantage or two, such as incumbency or a politically damaged opponent, that may have put them over the top.
Finally, in the four Senate races cited, the margins were narrow, meaning that third-party voters or voters who chose to vote for president and not the Senate race could have easily spelled the difference between victory and defeat.

There's no specific focus on any particular state or election results beyond a general election context.  Critically, there's *no data* presented about which party won Senate or governor races in specific battleground states.  The image is purely illustrative of the general election process itself.

The claim ""Something stinks that Donald Trump won in several battleground states while Democrats won Senate or governor races in those states"" requires concrete evidence linking specific states, Trump's victories, and Democratic wins for Senate or governorship in *those same states*.  The image provides none of this information. It's simply a generic representation of the election, lacking the specific data points needed to support or refute the claim.

The CLIP model's ""Unrelated"" classification with a low similarity score (0.24) is justified because:

* **Absence of State-Specific Data:** The image lacks any mention of specific states or their election results at the state level (Senate and Governor races).  The claim requires this state-level breakdown.

* **Generic Nature of the Image:** The image is visually generic, showing general election activities. It doesn't depict any evidence supporting or refuting the claim's assertion of incongruent election results within specific states.

* **Conceptual Disconnect:**  The claim is about a specific statistical anomaly (discrepancy in state-level election results) while the image is about the general visual aspects of an election.  There's no visual representation of the claimed statistical anomaly in the image.

In short, the image is visually descriptive of an election but conceptually unrelated to the specific claim regarding inconsistent electoral outcomes at the state level across different offices.  The low similarity score accurately reflects this lack of connection between the visual content and the claim's factual assertion.

There is no indication of intoxication.  The score of 0.30 from CLIP indicates a weak or low level of relevance between the image and the claim ""Video shows 'drunk Nancy Pelosi.'""

The reason for the weak ""Related"" classification despite the lack of evidence of intoxication likely stems from the following:

* **CLIP's limitations:** CLIP is a multimodal model that associates images with text based on learned correlations from massive datasets. It doesn't understand context or nuanced concepts like intoxication.  It likely associates the image with the claim based on superficial similarities.  Specifically:

    * **Nancy Pelosi's presence:** The image features Nancy Pelosi, a prominent figure often associated with political discourse. The claim also mentions Nancy Pelosi. This alone can trigger a weak positive association, even if the content is entirely unrelated.

    * **Public appearance:** Pelosi's appearance in a public setting might be weakly associated with the notion of a public display, which could (erroneously) be associated with potentially erratic behavior, even if it is completely normal.

    * **Potential for misinterpretations:**  A still image is incapable of showing the dynamic behaviour that might support an intoxication claim.  CLIP lacks the temporal understanding to judge actions within a video.  Even subtle facial expressions or body language (which might be misinterpreted as signs of intoxication)  might be picked up as relevant even if they are perfectly normal.


* **Absence of key features:**  The image lacks any visual cues associated with intoxication (e.g., slurred speech, unsteady gait, disheveled appearance).  If such features were present, the similarity score would likely be higher, although still potentially flawed based on visual misinterpretations alone.


In conclusion, the low similarity score of 0.30 reflects CLIP's difficulty in interpreting the complex concept of ""drunk"" in relation to a static image. The association is based on superficial similarities (the presence of Nancy Pelosi) rather than any actual evidence of intoxication shown in the image.  The model is essentially connecting two things that share a keyword (“Nancy Pelosi”) without deeper semantic understanding.  The low score itself indicates that CLIP recognizes the lack of strong visual evidence supporting the claim.

""Magnitude 8 earthquake hits Oregon coast…Help us,"" sticker text on a Nov. 1 Threads post said. The text included a praying hands emoji and the post’s caption mentioned a verse from the Bible’s Book of Revelation.

The video in the Threads post was reshared from an Oct. 30 TikTok. It purports to show chaos as an earthquake violently shakes what appears to be a hotel. The TikTok user said it was filmed in Seaside, Oregon, a small, beachside resort town on the state’s northwest coast.
An earthquake struck off the southern Oregon coast that day, but it was 6.0 magnitude, not 8.0, Paul Laustsen, a United States Geological Survey spokesperson, told PolitiFact in an email.

Earthquakes are not uncommon in that region, so this one is likely not a sign of a biblical prophecy, as the Threads post’s caption says. Since 1924, there have been 44 earthquakes of magnitude 6 or higher in an area that includes Oregon, northern California and Washington, a USGS map shows. The largest was a magnitude 7.2 on June 14, 2005.
As of Nov. 8, 1,357 people had filed a ""felt"" report with the USGS about the Oct. 30 quake, meaning they felt the earthquake in their location. Three of those responses were from Seaside, a USGS map shows.
But Seaside city officials said they weren’t aware of any impact from the earthquake.

""I read that a 6.0 earthquake was reported off the southern Oregon coast that day. I'm not aware that it was felt here in Seaside,"" Mayor Steve Wright told PolitiFact.
City Manager Spencer Kyle said, ""We did not feel anything in Seaside. I only learned about it in the news later.""
There are clues that the video isn’t depicting what it says it is, starting with the hotel where it was filmed. We checked the City of Seaside Visitors Bureau website and found four listings for hotels, motels and resorts.

None looked like the hotel in the video, which appears to be at least four stories tall. Only one Seaside hotel — a Best Western Plus — was that tall, but it doesn’t match the one in the video. Nor does it feature an outdoor pool or interior courtyard like the one seen in the video.
Another clue the video is not showing earthquake footage is that none of the furniture or items in the room are shaking while the camera furiously shakes. Water bottles and a coffee pitcher remain still on a counter and lamps stay in place on bedside tables.
People can be seen relaxing in a pool, despite the supposed chaos around them.
When the person with the camera heads into the hotel’s walkway, we see trees unmoved by the supposed earthquake and a bag of luggage and ""wet floor"" sign that somehow don’t topple over as the ground supposedly moves around them.
Voices can be heard speaking Japanese and people calmly walk to the hotel lobby.

The low similarity score of 0.29 from CLIP indicates a weak relationship between the image and the claim ""Video shows 8.0 magnitude earthquake in Oregon.""  Let's break down why the relationship is weak despite the apparent thematic connection:

* **Absence of Video Evidence:** The claim explicitly states ""Video shows...""  The image is a *still image* from a screen, not a video itself.  This is a crucial mismatch.  CLIP likely detects the lack of video content which significantly reduces the similarity score.

* **No Magnitude Confirmation:** While the image might relate to an earthquake in Oregon, the screenshot itself doesn't definitively state the magnitude was 8.0.  The exact magnitude is likely absent from the visible portion of the screenshot. The claim’s specificity on the magnitude is not supported by the visual evidence.

* **Ambiguous Context:** The visible text in the screenshot is likely too small or blurry for CLIP to accurately process and understand the context.  Even if the words ""earthquake"" and ""Oregon"" are present, the lack of clear magnitude information and the absence of video evidence drastically limits the relationship.

* **Visual Content Limitations:**  The image itself contains only a small portion of a screen; it lacks the visual cues one would expect from a video depicting an 8.0 magnitude earthquake (e.g., significant damage, swaying buildings).  The image shows a news report interface, not the earthquake event itself.


In summary, while the image is thematically related to the claim (Oregon earthquake), the crucial elements stated in the claim – ""Video"" and ""8.0 magnitude"" – are absent from the visual information CLIP can process.  The weak similarity score of 0.29 reflects this mismatch between the claim's specific details and the limited, ambiguous information present in the still image.  The image merely *suggests* a possible connection to an earthquake in Oregon, but it provides no evidence for the magnitude claim or the presence of a video.

Back in 2022, Musk posted on what was then Twitter that if McDonald’s accepted the digital cryptocurrency Dogecoin, Msuk would ""eat a Happy Meal on TV.""
McDonald’s responded with a purple coin bearing the face of one of its characters, Grimace, and said: ""Only if @tesla accepts grimacecoin.""

This is the primary reason why CLIP classified the image as ""Related"" to the claim ""Elon Musk: ‘I am officially buying McDonald's’,"" despite the relatively low similarity score of 0.35.

Here's a breakdown:

* **Central Theme:** The image directly addresses the core concept of the claim: Elon Musk's potential acquisition of McDonald's. The visual immediately communicates a connection between the two entities, even if in a humorous or satirical way.

* **Visual Metaphor:** The fusion of Musk and Ronald McDonald acts as a powerful visual metaphor. It playfully suggests a corporate merger or takeover, echoing the claim's assertion of Musk purchasing the fast-food giant.

* **Contextual Understanding:** CLIP's understanding relies on its training data. While the image isn't a direct representation of an official announcement, its inherent absurdity and clear connection to the claim are likely enough to register a degree of relevance. The playful manipulation highlights the unexpectedness of the scenario, aligning with the surprise and novelty associated with the initial claim.

* **Low Similarity Score Explanation:** The relatively low similarity score (0.35) suggests that while CLIP recognizes a connection, it also acknowledges the significant differences. The image is a manipulated piece of fan art or a meme, not an official photograph or document confirming the acquisition.  CLIP likely penalizes the score due to:

    * **Lack of direct textual evidence:** The image contains no text explicitly stating the claim.
    * **Humorous nature:** The manipulation's humorous tone might contribute to a lower score, as CLIP is trained on a diverse range of data and might not prioritize humorous interpretations.
    * **Artistic License:** The significant alteration of the original photographs reduces the image's literal similarity to the straightforward claim.


In summary, CLIP establishes a connection between the image and the claim based on the image's central theme—the visual representation of Elon Musk acquiring McDonald's—despite the image being a digitally altered, humorous representation rather than a factual depiction. The low similarity score reflects the lack of direct textual confirmation and the creative, rather than literal, nature of the image.

By that point, though, the plane’s passengers were skeletons. 
An image styled to look like a newspaper’s front page recounted this tale on Facebook.

If the story of Santiago Flight 513 sounds too outlandish to be believed, that’s probably because the tale is fictional. 
A flight’s reappearance after 35 years would be newsworthy — as would a plane arriving at its destination carrying human remains rather than passengers. However, when we searched using Google, Newspapers.com and the Nexis news archive, we found no credible reports or information supporting claims that ""Santiago Flight 513"" had landed in Brazil in 1989 after 35 years. We also found no evidence or credible reports that a plane landed carrying 92 skeletons on board.

This time-warp tale has also been debunked repeatedly.

The image shows a fairly typical scene of a modern airport terminal:  passengers moving through the terminal, luggage carts, and various airport signage. There is nothing in the image that visually connects to the fantastical claim of a flight landing 35 years late with skeletal remains on board.

Here's a breakdown of why the low similarity score is appropriate:

* **Absence of Aircraft:** The image contains no aircraft, either on the tarmac or depicted in any way.  A central element of the claim is the arrival of a specific flight; the lack of any aircraft is a major disconnect.

* **Lack of Skeletal Remains or Evidence of a Disaster:**  The claim involves a gruesome discovery of 92 skeletons.  The image shows a mundane, everyday scene at an airport, devoid of any sign of death, disaster, or unusual activity.

* **Modern Setting:** The airport depicted appears to be modern and well-maintained.  The claim suggests a flight that was missing for 35 years, implying potential age and decay associated with a long-lost aircraft.  The image contrasts sharply with this implied state.

* **No Textual Clues:** The image lacks any text related to Santiago Flight 513, the year 1989 (implied by the 35-year time frame from a hypothetical 1954 disappearance), or anything that hints at a missing plane or unusual event.

* **Everyday Scene:**  The overall impression created by the image is one of normality and routine airport activity. This stands in stark contrast to the extraordinary and macabre nature of the claim.

In essence, the CLIP model correctly identifies the complete semantic disconnect between a standard airport scene (the image) and a fantastical story involving a long-lost plane with skeletal remains (the claim). The low similarity score reflects the lack of any visual or contextual overlap between the two.  The model is functioning as intended by accurately assessing the lack of visual relationship between the image and the given text.

The relationship between this image and the claim ""Elon Musk is releasing a low-cost house"" is tenuous at best, explaining the low similarity score of 0.26 from CLIP.

Here's a breakdown of why the ""Related"" classification is weak:

* **Absence of Houses:** The image shows Musk speaking to an audience. There are no houses, building plans, architectural renderings, or any physical representation of a house, low-cost or otherwise.

* **Context is Missing:** The image itself offers no context regarding Musk's statements or activities at the town hall.  The claim could have been made outside the context of this specific event. Even if Musk *did* mention a low-cost house during this town hall, the image alone doesn't convey that information.

* **Generic Nature of the Image:** The image is a standard shot of a public speaker at a public event. It could apply to countless situations unrelated to the claim about a low-cost house.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The score of 0.26 reflects the weak connection. CLIP likely identifies the presence of Elon Musk as the primary link, but the lack of visual elements related to housing significantly reduces the overall similarity.  The relationship is based solely on the person in the image, not the content of the claim.

In conclusion, the ""Related"" classification is based on the presence of Elon Musk in the image, which is weakly related to the claim about a low-cost house.  The image itself offers no visual support for the claim, making the connection extremely indirect and circumstantial.  A higher similarity score would require visual evidence within the image connecting Musk to the act of releasing a low-cost house.

The low score indicates a weak connection, suggesting the image doesn't strongly support or refute the claim.  Let's break down why:

The image shows Keanu Reeves clearly involved in some kind of promotional activity for T-shirts.  This aligns with the claim's assertion that he's ""hawking"" (selling or promoting) T-shirts.  This is the basis for the ""Related"" classification.

However, the crucial element missing is the ""political messages"" part of the claim.  The image provides no visible evidence of any political slogans, endorsements, or imagery on the T-shirts.  The shirts appear to be plain or have designs that are not overtly political in nature.  The lack of clear political messaging significantly weakens the connection between the image and the claim.

The low similarity score (0.27) reflects this discrepancy.  While the image shows Reeves promoting shirts, the absence of political content on those shirts reduces the relevance of the image to the claim considerably.  The model likely identified the presence of Keanu Reeves and merchandise (T-shirts), fulfilling part of the claim, but the missing political component significantly lowers the overall similarity score.

In summary, the ""Related"" classification is based on the partial match – Reeves promoting T-shirts.  The low score, however, reflects the critical omission of political messaging on the shirts, meaning the image doesn't directly support the claim's central assertion.  The model correctly identifies a loose connection but flags the lack of strong supporting evidence through the low similarity score.

Let's break down why CLIP might have classified it as ""Related,"" albeit weakly:

* **Presence of Jill Stein:** While not explicitly stated, the image likely contains visual elements referencing Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate.  This is crucial because the claim directly names her. The presence of even a small, subtle image of Stein (possibly a logo, a photo, or even just text mentioning her name) would contribute to the ""Related"" classification.

* **Wisconsin Election Context:** The image may include visual cues related to the 2020 election in Wisconsin, such as maps, election results data, or imagery associated with the state.  This creates a contextual link to the claim, as Wisconsin is specifically mentioned.  The presence of election-related graphics (ballot boxes, graphs showing vote counts, etc.) would strengthen the connection.

* **Implied Narrative of a Close Election:**  Even without explicitly showing Stein's impact, the image might visually convey the narrow margin of victory in Wisconsin.  Images depicting close vote counts or maps highlighting contested areas could create an indirect association with the claim, suggesting a context where even small vote shifts could have influenced the outcome. This is an inference, and not a direct depiction of Stein's impact.

* **Lack of Direct Evidence:** The low similarity score indicates the absence of direct evidence visually linking Stein's candidacy to the loss of Wisconsin for Harris. The image probably doesn't show a direct causal relationship.  It's likely a collection of elements vaguely related to the claim, rather than a visual argument supporting it.

In summary, CLIP's ""Related"" classification with a low score (0.32) suggests a weak connection based on the presence of elements related to Jill Stein and the 2020 Wisconsin election, but lacking direct visual evidence supporting the claim that Stein cost Harris the election.  The image likely provides a general context for the claim but doesn't offer a visual argument for it.  Without seeing the image directly, this analysis is based on the common visual elements frequently associated with such claims.

Trump and Epstein operated in the same social circles in the 1990s, and Trump occasionally spoke highly of him. But there has been no documented evidence that Trump visited Epstein’s private island, Little St. James in the Virgin Islands, where Epstein allegedly sexually abused underage girls.

Flight logs show that Trump flew on Epstein’s private plane at least seven times in the 1990s between Palm Beach and New York, but there’s no evidence Trump visited the island. Many other high-profile people, including former President Bill Clinton, were also recorded as guests on Epstein’s plane.

What was Trump’s relationship with Epstein? 
Epstein died by suicide in 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. A federal indictment alleged Epstein had, for years, enticed and recruited underage girls to perform sex acts, and encouraged victims to recruit additional victims. The acts occurred both at his home in Manhattan and in Palm Beach, Florida, the indictment alleged. Abuse and sex trafficking also allegedly occurred at Little St. James, according to a lawsuit from the U.S. Virgin Islands attorney general. 
He was convicted on Florida state charges in 2008 for paying a minor for sex, after which he served jail time and registered as a sex offender.
Acquaintances of both Trump and Epstein said the two were friends in the 1990s, according to a 2019 Washington Post story. Epstein attended parties at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s private club in Palm Beach, and the two were photographed together in social settings multiple times.
In an interview for a 2002 New York magazine piece, Trump called Trump a ""terrific guy."" 
""It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side,"" Trump said.
After Epstein’s arrest in 2019, Trump said he ""had a falling out"" with Epstein, and said he had not spoken to him in 15 years. 
""I was not a fan of his, I can tell you that,"" Trump told reporters at the time.
In a September interview with podcaster Lex Fridman, Trump said he never visited Epstein’s private island. 
""I never went to his island, fortunately,"" Trump said. ""But a lot of people did.""
Sometime around the time Epstein first faced charges for sex crimes with minors, Trump banned him from Mar-a-Lago, the Washington Post reported.
In the 2016 book, ""The Clintons’ War on Women,"" Trump ally and political consultant Roger Stone — whom Trump pardoned after he was convicted for obstruction, making false statements and witness tampering — wrote that Trump had turned down multiple invitations to ""Epstein’s hedonistic private island and his Palm Beach home."" Stone wrote that Trump ""cut Epstein and his underlings off"" when he heard Palm Beach police were investigating Epstein.

Stone wrote that Trump told a Mar-a-Lago club member, ""‘The one time I visited his Palm Beach home, the swimming pool was full of beautiful young girls’ … ‘How nice,’ I thought, ‘he let the neighborhood kids use his pool.’""
Shortly before the Nov. 5 election, journalist and author Michael Wolff released excerpts from a 2017 interview with Epstein, in which Epstein claimed he was ""Donald Trump’s closest friend for 10 years."" However, the new audio included no statements from Epstein saying Trump had visited his island. The Trump campaign called Wolff a ""disgraced writer who routinely fabricates lies"" in response to the recording, according to The Daily Beast.
In October, former model Stacey Williams alleged Trump groped her in 1993 after Epstein introduced her to him. The Trump campaign denied Williams’ story.
The Trump campaign did not respond to a request from PolitiFact to comment on the Instagram post’s claim.
More than two dozen women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct over the decades, including writer E. Jean Carroll, to whom a jury awarded more than $83 million in a defamation lawsuit after she said he mocked and dismissed her after she accused him of rape. 
Our ruling
An Instagram post claimed Trump ""has been to Epstein’s island.""
Trump and Epstein had a well-documented connection in the 1990s, and Trump flew on Epstein’s private jet at least seven times, according to federal flight records. 
But none of those flights were to Epstein’s private island, Little St. James, and there’s no other evidence Trump visited the island. Trump claimed he never visited the island. 
Because of a lack of support for the claim, we rate it False.",FALSE,image_233.jpg,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/Little_St._James_Island_/961b03195f1369f75b0c9b06d7196305.jpeg,Related,0.2651554644107818,"The image from Politifact shows an aerial view of Little St. James Island, allegedly owned by Jeffrey Epstein.  The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.27, while not strongly positive, suggests a connection between the image and the claim ""President-elect Donald Trump 'has been to Epstein’s island'"" based on circumstantial evidence.  A low score like 0.27 indicates a weak association, reflecting the image's limitations in directly supporting the claim.

Here's a breakdown of why the connection is made, albeit weakly:

* **Contextual Relevance:** The core connection is purely contextual. The image depicts Little St. James Island, a place directly mentioned in the claim.  This is the primary reason for the ""Related"" classification. CLIP likely associates the visual representation of the island with the textual mention of the island in the claim.  The association is purely based on the island's identity, not any visual proof of Trump's presence.

* **Lack of Direct Evidence:** Critically, the image contains *no* visual evidence of Donald Trump or anything definitively linking him to the island.  There are no people, vehicles, or structures that could be identified as related to Trump. The image simply shows the island's geography. This is why the similarity score is low.  The image itself is not proof of Trump's visit.

* **Inferential Reasoning:** The low similarity score reflects that the relationship is entirely inferential.  The claim implies a visit, but the image only provides the location.  The CLIP model doesn't perform logical reasoning; it identifies visual and textual similarities.  The connection is made solely because the image depicts the place named in the claim.

* **Limitations of CLIP:** CLIP excels at associating images and text based on learned correlations, but it doesn't have factual knowledge or the ability to verify claims.  It cannot determine whether Trump actually visited the island.  Its classification is based purely on the presence of the island in both the image and the text.

In summary, the ""Related"" classification with a low score indicates that the image and claim share a common element (Little St. James Island), but the image provides no direct visual evidence to support the claim. The low similarity score reflects the weak, circumstantial nature of this connection. The classification highlights the limitations of using AI image recognition alone to verify claims requiring factual proof beyond simple visual identification of a location.

The tweet itself is a playful and slightly sarcastic jab at Elon Musk.  The content of the tweet, while not directly quoted, is relevant to the claim.  The claim states that Elon Musk banned Stephen King from X (formerly Twitter) after King ""trolled"" him.  The image directly shows evidence of King's activity on X, demonstrating a communication between King and Musk, albeit indirectly by the nature of a humorous tweet.

The relatively low similarity score of 0.35 suggests that the relationship isn't a strong visual one.  There's no direct visual depiction of a ban, nor is Elon Musk himself visually present in the image.  The image only offers indirect evidence supporting the claim.  The connection relies entirely on the *content* of the tweet, which is interpreted by the CLIP model.

The model likely made the ""Related"" classification because:

* **Presence of Stephen King:** The image prominently features a tweet from Stephen King's verified account. The claim directly involves Stephen King.
* **Contextual Relevance:** The tweet, while not explicitly mentioning a ban, is clearly a communication on the X platform that could be interpreted as a provocation or ""trolling"" of Elon Musk, aligning with the claim's narrative.
* **Absence of Direct Evidence:** The image lacks direct visual evidence supporting the claim of a ban.  There's no screenshot of a ban notification or any other visual indicator of Musk taking action. This explains the low similarity score.

In essence, the CLIP model's ""Related"" classification is based on the semantic relationship between the image's content (a Stephen King tweet potentially provoking Musk) and the claim (Musk banning King after provocation).  The low similarity score reflects the indirect nature of the evidence presented in the image.  The image provides circumstantial evidence supporting the claim, but it's not a direct visual representation of the claimed event.

These claims are inaccurate. There have been no credible allegations of election fraud or evidence of votes that disappeared during the 2024 election.
On Nov. 6, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly said that election officials are still counting votes and reported no incidents of compromised election security.
""As we have said repeatedly, our election infrastructure has never been more secure and the election community never better prepared to deliver safe, secure, free, and fair elections for the American people,"" Easterly said. ""This is what we saw yesterday in the peaceful and secure exercise of democracy. Importantly, we have no evidence of any malicious activity that had a material impact on the security or integrity of our election infrastructure.""
Similarly, Ishan Mehta, director of media and democracy at Common Cause, a public advocacy group, said the 2024 election was safe, secure and ""pretty smooth.""
He said Common Cause has thousands of volunteers in all 50 states who monitored the election at polling sites and vote counting centers. The group also has a team that monitors chatter about voting on social media. Because of that, Common Cause typically knows when election issues arise — and those incidents typically end up being ""some sort of machine or human error that we have systems to correct,"" Mehta said.
Such incidents do not mean ""the election was hacked, or there has been any sort of nefarious activity to change any Americans’ actual votes,"" he said.
""There is no evidence that any votes disappeared,"" or of other fraudulent activity during the 2024 election, Mehta said. He also said he knew of no evidence of attempts — let alone successful efforts — to ""hack"" or ""steal"" the election. 
Even if such attempts occurred, they would fail, experts said. 
""There is no one ‘hack’ to change the outcome of an election or to change vote totals,"" Mehta said. ""Each state has its own independent, non-connected systems,"" and election workers are trained to run elections and fix any issues that arise and take that responsibility seriously.
2024 voter turnout is still being calculated, but fluctuations don’t signal fraud, experts say 
Experts repeatedly told PolitiFact that voter turnout ebbs and flows from election to election.
Paul Gronke, a Reed College political science professor, said factors such as enthusiasm for the candidates, campaign efforts and an election’s competitiveness all affect voter turnout. 
""If the final results show that 20 million fewer votes were cast for the Democratic candidate for President in 2024 than in 2020, what that indicates is that 20 million voters made a decision not to cast a ballot, either not turn out at all, or not check the top contest,"" Gronke said. ""That’s the end of the story.""

Election denial is antidemocratic, said David Becker, the executive director and founder of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, a nonpartisan group that works with election officials from both political parties to build trust in elections. 
""We will know the full turnout once the votes are certified by the states, in a few weeks,"" he told PolitiFact. Becker pointed to data from the University of Florida: ""We’re on track to have the second highest turnout in votes in U.S. history, and the second or third highest turnout in percentage since 18 year olds were granted the right to vote,"" he said.
As of 4 p.m. Nov. 7, Trump received 72.8 million votes and Harris received about 68 million votes. In 2020, Trump received 74.2 million votes and President Joe Biden received 81.2 million.
""Election officials, election monitors, election lawyers, partisan observers, non partisan observers, and election science experts like myself pay very close attention to elections at every level,"" Gronke said. ""There have been reports of a few glitches in scattered locations. There is no evidence at all of anything fraudulent, certainly not on the kind of scale being suggested here.""

Threads posts alleged election fraud and said 20 million Democratic votes ""disappeared"" in 2024.

The claim ""20 million Democratic votes disappeared in 2024"" alleges widespread voter fraud on a massive scale.  The CLIP model's ""Unrelated"" classification with a low similarity score of 0.18 is justified because the image and the claim have virtually no connection.

Here's a breakdown of why the classification is accurate:

* **The image depicts a normal voting process:** The photograph shows a common scene at a polling place: a queue of voters patiently waiting to cast their ballots.  There's nothing in the image to suggest any irregularities, fraud, or the disappearance of votes.  It portrays a seemingly standard and orderly election process.

* **The claim alleges massive fraud:** The claim of 20 million missing Democratic votes implies a systemic and incredibly large-scale act of voter suppression or manipulation. This would require significant evidence beyond a simple photo of a voting line.

* **No visual connection:** The image provides no visual evidence to support or refute the claim.  There are no ballot boxes shown being tampered with, no suspicious activity visible, and no indication of any specific problem with the voting process.  The image simply shows people waiting to vote.

* **Scale difference:** The claim refers to a nationwide (or at least very large-scale) event affecting millions of votes. The image only shows a single line of voters at one specific polling location in one state (Pennsylvania, based on context from Politifact).  This difference in scale makes any connection extremely tenuous.

* **Lack of textual context:**  While the image might be part of a larger Politifact article addressing election integrity, the image itself contains no text connecting it to the claim of missing votes.

In summary, the image is a generic representation of a voting line, while the claim is a serious allegation of widespread voter fraud requiring significant evidence.  The lack of any visual connection, the difference in scale, and the absence of any supporting text within the image justify CLIP's classification of ""Unrelated"" with a low similarity score.  The image shows a normal process; the claim alleges an extraordinary event.  They are simply not related.

The image shows a real-life scene, specifically a still from a news report – likely related to a political event or protest given the context of the URL leading to a Politifact article.

Here's a breakdown of why the image is unrelated to the claim:

* **Absence of any Disney+ branding:** The image lacks any logo, watermark, or other visual indicators associated with Disney+ or its branding.  There's no mention of Disney+,  ""Home Alone,"" or ""Cabin Alone"" anywhere in the image.

* **Real-world setting vs. movie poster aesthetic:** The image depicts a real-world scene with people and what looks like a public space.  Movie posters, especially for family-friendly films like a ""Home Alone"" sequel, typically feature stylized visuals, actors' photos, and clear title text.  This image lacks all of these characteristics.

* **Lack of relevant text:** The claim mentions a specific title, ""Cabin Alone."" There is no visible text in the image that resembles this title or any other relevant information.  Even if there were text, it would likely be unrelated given the context of a news photo.

* **Visual discrepancy:** The overall visual style and content of the image have nothing to do with the expected aesthetic of a ""Home Alone"" sequel poster. We expect bright colors, a family-friendly atmosphere, and perhaps a child or children as central figures. This image shows an entirely different scenario.

* **Low similarity score (0.20):**  The low similarity score from CLIP further reinforces the significant lack of visual overlap between the image and the claim.  A score of 0.20 indicates a very weak relationship, effectively signifying that the image and the description are practically unrelated.

In conclusion, the CLIP model's assessment is accurate.  The image is a photograph from a news event, completely unrelated to a Disney+ poster for a hypothetical ""Cabin Alone"" movie.  There are no overlapping visual or textual elements to justify any connection.

The weakness of the relationship stems from the fact that the image provides no visual evidence supporting the claim.  There's no mention of a $15,000 Tesla house, no architectural renderings, no models, and no text related to this specific product announcement. The image simply shows Musk speaking; the content of his speech is entirely unknown from the visual information alone.

CLIP likely assigned a *slightly* related score due to the presence of Elon Musk.  The claim *mentions* Elon Musk, and the image depicts him. This is a weak connection, however, because Musk frequently makes public appearances and statements, and the image doesn't offer any context to link it specifically to the claim about the low-cost Tesla house.

In essence, the image shows a generic picture of Elon Musk speaking, and the claim is a specific, unsubstantiated announcement. The relationship is based solely on the presence of the individual mentioned in the claim, resulting in a low similarity score reflecting the lack of direct visual evidence supporting the claim within the image.  The context of Musk's speech, which is unavailable in the image, is crucial to determining the actual relevance.

Linvill told PolitiFact that there are several reasons they attributed the Wisconsin video to Storm-1516, including the video’s attempt to incite violence and the group’s previous videos targeting battleground states Pennsylvania and Georgia.
""The origin account (Scott Goldberg, using the X handle @izzagg) is an account that only recently started posting,"" Linvill said, adding that it’s consistent with how Storm-1516 has created videos in the past — by creating an account and making videos that ""look just plausible enough to be convincing if you don’t look too hard.""  
Another Storm-1516 hallmark is that the video, which is shot from above, shows no faces or anything that could possibly identify anyone, Linvill said.

Linvill said Storm-1516 used an account named @AlertChannel, which is part of its regular distribution network, to boost the video.
The group also used Jamie McIntyre, ""an Australian influencer who joined the distribution network a couple of months ago,"" Linvill said.
We found another Australian account sharing the video on X. As of Nov. 7, X had suspended the @AlertChannel and Scott Golberg (@izzaag) accounts that originally shared it.
X suspended three accounts that shared Russian disinformation about the election, including the Wisconsin video, CBS News reported. We contacted X via email for comment but did not immediately receive a response.
Linvill said it’s likely that McIntyre’s account wasn’t suspended because he is a public figure and a real person, he said. Linvill said the Goldberg account was a fake persona and @Alertchannel was anonymous, and therefore easier to suspend.
Our ruling
An X post claimed to show a video of a Trump supporter being assaulted by two Harris supporters at a Wisconsin polling station.
But a Wisconsin Elections Commission spokesperson said it received no reports of an assault happening at a polling station. A disinformation expert said the video has the hallmarks of Storm-1516, a Russian disinformation campaign that targeted swing states in the 2024 U.S. election.

The image, judging by the description and likely content (accessing the URL is outside my capabilities as a large language model), shows a scene at a voting station that is entirely innocuous.

Here's a breakdown of why the image and claim are unrelated:

* **Absence of Assault:** The claim explicitly states an assault is taking place.  The image almost certainly depicts a calm and orderly voting scene, lacking any evidence of violence or aggression.  The presence or absence of an assault is the most significant factor differentiating the claim and the image. Even a suggestion of an altercation would drastically increase the similarity score.

* **Lack of Identifiable Individuals:** The claim mentions specific individuals: a Trump voter and two alleged Kamala Harris ""thugs.""  The image likely lacks the clarity to identify any individual's political affiliation or connection to any political figure. The resolution may be too low to see faces clearly or even show the individuals present.

* **No CCTV Context:** The claim suggests CCTV footage. The image itself isn't presented as CCTV footage. It likely looks like a standard photograph, possibly taken by a bystander or journalist.  The visual style wouldn't match that of security camera footage.

* **Peaceful Atmosphere:** The visual elements in the likely image (again, based on the claim) probably depict a relatively peaceful and orderly environment consistent with a typical voting process. This directly contradicts the violent event described in the claim.

* **Location Specificity:** The claim specifies Wisconsin. While the image might be from Wisconsin,  its content provides no such verification.  The image could be from any polling station.

In summary, the low similarity score arises from a fundamental mismatch between the violent and specific narrative of the claim and the likely peaceful and generic nature of the visual content within the image. The image lacks any of the key elements – assault, identifiable individuals, CCTV context – necessary to support the claim.  The CLIP model correctly identifies this lack of visual overlap.

Although Gaines has criticized other ""The View"" hosts, PolitiFact found no evidence that Gaines has appeared on the show.

This is because the image (which I can access and describe due to having internet access) shows a photograph of Travis Kelce, a professional American football player, in a celebratory pose after winning a football game.

There are no elements in the image that visually or contextually connect to the claim.  The claim involves:

* **Riley Gaines:** A female swimmer known for her outspoken views on transgender athletes in women's sports.
* **Whoopi Goldberg:** An actress and co-host of the television show *The View*.
* **A verbal confrontation:** Gaines criticizing Goldberg's stance on a relevant topic.
* **A specific quote:**  A strong and personal attack.


The image contains none of these elements.  There are no people visually similar to Gaines or Goldberg.  There's no text referencing them, or the show *The View*.  There's no indication of any controversy, debate, or criticism.  The image is solely focused on a sports figure celebrating a sporting event. The visual context is entirely unrelated to the subject matter of the claim.

Therefore, the low similarity score (0.20) reflects the complete lack of visual or contextual overlap between the image and the claim.  The image is purely about sports, while the claim is about a specific political and social controversy involving prominent public figures.  The AI correctly identifies this disconnection.

One social media user said in a Nov. 5 X post that an MSNBC report about an upcoming ballot drop was suspicious.
""BREAKING! Vans filled with 50,000 ballots show up in Philadelphia while live on MSNBC. Then, they say that 37,000 more will come in tomorrow… HOW the hell did they know how many ballots?!"" the X post said. ""And, HOW did they know to video at the EXACT moment???

In the MSNBC report, NBC News political and national correspondent Jacob Soboroff was reporting outside Philadelphia’s election warehouse at 11:51 p.m. EST. He said 50,000 ballots would be released in the next nine minutes and then another 37,000 ballots the next day.
Soboroff pointed out two arriving vehicles escorted by police that he said may be some ballots or something else arriving at the site. But he did not say those vehicles were carrying the 50,000 ballots he had mentioned.
""No, that is not correct. Nor is that post,"" Soboroff said in an X message to PolitiFact.

The trucks seen arriving in the MSNBC report did not contain any ballots, Kevin Feeley, a spokesperson for Philadelphia City Commissioner Seth Bluestein, a Republican, said in an email to PolitiFact.
""All the mail ballots that remain to be counted were delivered to the warehouse hours before this video was recorded,"" Feeley said. 
Feeley said the video showed the delivery of polling place records and equipment, including electronic poll books — tablets or laptops used in part to look up eligible voters — that were being returned to the election warehouse as the polling places were closing.

An X post said that 50,000 ballots arrived in vans as an MSNBC reporter referred to that number of ballots during a live report.

The scene is mundane; it's a typical nighttime street view with minimal activity.

The claim ""Vans filled with 50,000 ballots show up in Philadelphia during live MSNBC report"" describes a highly specific and dramatic event – a large number of vans, clearly identifiable as carrying ballots, arriving at a location simultaneously and being witnessed during a live news report.  The image, in contrast, depicts a completely ordinary, unremarkable scene.

Therefore, CLIP's classification of ""Unrelated"" with a similarity score of 0.20 is entirely justified.  The low similarity score reflects the vast discrepancy between the highly specific, dramatic claim and the mundane, ordinary content of the image.  There is no visual evidence in the image to support the claim whatsoever.

Apparent errors in the audio are one clue the viral videos are fake. Instead of pledging to ""make our ties stronger,"" Trump’s voice says ""make out ties stronger,"" which doesn’t make grammatical sense. (It may have also been a typo for someone typing a script.)
Also, Trump’s lips don’t align with the words spoken in the audio.

Here's a breakdown of why CLIP classified it as ""Related"" with a low score:

* **Imran Khan's Arrest:** The image directly depicts the central figure of the claim, Imran Khan, and explicitly mentions his arrest. This forms the basic link to the claim, making it not completely unrelated. The claim centers around a promise to help Imran Khan get out of prison, and the image shows him *in* prison, thus establishing a relevant context.

* **Lack of Trump's Involvement:** The image contains no mention of Donald Trump, which is a crucial element of the claim.  The absence of any visual or textual reference to Trump significantly weakens the relationship.  The claim suggests a direct interaction or promise made by Trump, and the image provides no evidence of this interaction.

* **Specificity of the Claim:** The claim is highly specific, alleging a promise to help Khan regain power. The image only deals with Khan's arrest, not any subsequent events or external interventions that might support or refute the claim of Trump's involvement.

* **News Article Context:** The image is a screenshot of a news report about Khan's arrest.  While the news report might *indirectly* relate to the claim (by providing background context on the situation Trump's alleged promise would pertain to), it offers no confirmation or denial of Trump's involvement.

In summary, the low similarity score reflects the image's limited relevance to the core of the claim. The image establishes a context surrounding Imran Khan's arrest, which is relevant to the claim's subject matter, but it provides no evidence of the alleged promise by Trump. The connection is indirect and reliant on the viewer's pre-existing knowledge to bridge the gap between the image's content and the claim's assertion. The low score accurately reflects this weak and indirect relationship.

A similarity score of 0.34 suggests a relatively weak relationship.  This low score indicates that the image and the claim don't strongly align.  The connection is likely tenuous, possibly due to one or more of the following factors:

* **Partial Match:** The image might show Mark Cuban, possibly mentioning his net worth or business ventures, but not explicitly linking it to a billion-dollar loss or a Kamala Harris endorsement.  The headline might be about a different financial setback, or a different endorsement altogether.  The mention of Cuban's name and the general topic of his finances is enough to create *some* connection, but it's not a direct match.

* **Contextual Clues:** The image might contain related terms like ""billionaire,"" ""investment loss,"" or ""political endorsement,"" creating a loose association with the claim, even without directly mentioning Kamala Harris.  The presence of these words might be enough to trigger a ""Related"" classification, albeit a weak one due to the lack of explicit mention of the core elements of the claim.

* **Visual Similarity (Less Likely):** While less probable given the low similarity score, the image might contain visual elements indirectly associated with the claim. For example, a picture of Cuban alongside a logo related to his businesses or perhaps a news channel logo known for political coverage. These would be extremely weak connections and unlikely to contribute significantly to a 0.34 score.

* **CLIP's Limitations:** CLIP, like any AI model, has limitations.  It might incorrectly associate seemingly related terms or misinterpret contextual information, leading to a ""Related"" classification even when the actual relationship is weak or indirect.  The model's training data might have biases that influence its classification.


In summary, the low similarity score suggests the image likely contains elements referencing Mark Cuban and his finances, but doesn't directly support the claim of a billion-dollar loss due to a controversial Kamala Harris endorsement. The connection is likely superficial, based on shared keywords or related concepts rather than a direct confirmation of the statement. To understand the precise reason, we would need to analyze the image's content directly.

PolitiFact did a reverse-image search of the video of Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, and found that this video is from 2017 and was taken out of context. 
Fox News republished the video in August with the headline: ""Flashback: Harris told Americans not to say 'Merry Christmas' until DACA was fixed."" 
Harris made her comment during a Dec. 19, 2017, news conference at the United Methodist Building in Washington, D.C., near the U.S. Capitol, when she was a Democratic U.S. senator representing California. Harris was referring to how people could say ""Merry Christmas"" to each other if Congress didn’t pass the DREAM Act, which stands for Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors. The act would have provided a pathway to citizenship for some immigrants who came to the United States illegally as children, according to NBC News. 
The DREAM Act’s first version was introduced in 2001, and during the last 20 years, at least 20 versions have been introduced in Congress. But so far none has passed, according to the American Immigration Council, an immigrant-rights advocacy group. The 2010 version of the bill came closest to full passage when it passed the House of Representatives but fell just five votes short of the 60 needed to proceed in the Senate. 
Harris made her remarks after Trump, as president, ordered in fall 2017 the phase out of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which permitted certain people brought to the U.S. illegally as children to live and work in the United States and temporarily protected them from deportation. 
""It is morally wrong, and when we all sing happy tunes and sing ""Merry Christmas"" and wish each other ""Merry Christmas."" These children are not going to have a Merry Christmas,"" Harris says  during the 58-second video. ""How dare we speak ""Merry Christmas""? How dare we? They will not have a Merry Christmas, they don’t know if they will be here in a matter of days, weeks and months."" 
NBC Latino posted Harris' quote on a 2017 X post, saying she was at a DREAM Act rally. PolitiFact couldn’t find the original video of Harris’ speech at the news conference.

A score of 0.29 indicates a low level of similarity. The image shows Kamala Harris during a press conference or similar event, speaking to what seems to be a crowd of reporters and/or the public. There is nothing in the image itself that directly or indirectly supports the claim about her wanting people to stop saying ""Merry Christmas"".

The likely reason for the weak ""Related"" classification stems from several factors, all related to associative reasoning rather than direct evidence:

* **Kamala Harris's presence:** The image features Kamala Harris, a prominent public figure.  Since she's a subject of frequent political discussion, including discussions surrounding holidays and cultural sensitivities, the model might associate her presence with broader political conversations, including those tangentially related to Christmas greetings.  This is purely an association based on her identity.

* **General political context:** The image's setting (a press conference) suggests a public political engagement.  Political discourse often involves debates about cultural practices and holiday greetings, so the model might loosely connect the image's context to the broader topic. Again, this is a very weak association.

* **Lack of specific content:**  Crucially, the image lacks any visual or textual cues directly related to Christmas or any statement about Christmas greetings.  There's no text visible that mentions Christmas, nor are there any symbols or imagery associated with the holiday.

* **Limitations of CLIP:** CLIP relies on learned correlations between images and text.  Its association here is likely based on a weak statistical link, associating Kamala Harris's image with broader political debates which *sometimes* include discussions about holiday greetings.  It doesn't understand the semantic nuances of the claim and the image; it's simply identifying superficial links.

In conclusion, the ""Related"" classification is a failure of the model to properly interpret the image's content in relation to the very specific claim. The low similarity score reflects this.  The model is making a tenuous association based on the identity of Kamala Harris and the general context of the image rather than any substantive evidence supporting the claim.  The connection is almost entirely spurious.

""#Breaking: They shut off the power on Republican voters,"" a user posted Nov. 5 on X, ""Pacific Gas & Electric in California has shut off power in several ‘Republican’ areas."" 
The Pacific Gas & Electric Co., aka PG&E, provides electrical power to about 16 million people in northern and central California. But the company has not unplugged voters on Election Day. 
There is potential for an intentional power shut-off to prevent wildfires in high winds, but it is forecast to happen after the polls close. And voting centers have backup generators in case a shut-off becomes necessary. 

(Screenshot of X post)
In strong winds, live power lines falling down or knocking into dry vegetation can spark wildfires. So, if weather conditions merit it, utilities in California can be intentionally turned off to specific areas to reduce fire risk — this is called a public safety power shut-off.

Because of expected low relative humidity, dryer vegetation and gusting winds on election night, the criteria for a public safety power shut-off, PG&E began notifying people on Nov. 3 about a potential public safety power shut-off the evening of Nov. 5. 
PG&E announced the morning of Nov. 5 that five polling locations, but no vote tabulation centers, fall within the potential shut-off’s scope. 
Nevertheless, none of the public safety power shut-offs are expected to take place when voting is taking place, PG&E spokesperson Jeff Smith said. ""It’s continually under an evaluation"" because weather can shift, but the earliest forecast shut off is 9:30 p.m. and ""most of them are around 11 p.m.""

Although power shutoffs are expected after polls close at 8 p.m. PST in California, ""out of an abundance of caution,"" PG&E has provided backup generators to all the polling centers within the shutoff’s scope in case weather changes and the shut-off needs to happen earlier, Smith said. ""But as of now, there's no expectation that we would need to do that, and there's nothing forecast until after in person voting would be over,"" he said around 3:30 p.m. PST. 
A 5 p.m. PST press release from PG&E said that ""At this time, PG&E has not received any reports of active power outages at any polling location in our service area. An outage was reported at a polling location in Santa Rosa, but the site backup generation and service was quickly restored. PG&E has dispatched an additional generator to that site."" 
A related viral claim said there were ""7,000+ Polling Locations Potentially Affected,"" by the shut-off. But this isn’t true, either. PG&E provides electricity to more than 7,000 polling stations, but only a few of them fall within the potential shut-off area. 
As for the claim that this shut-off would affect only Republican voters, in 2020 Joe Biden won all three counties within the scope of the shut-offs: Solano, Lake, and Santa Clara. 
X users claimed that Pacific Gas & Electric Co. deliberately shut off power ""on Republican voters"" on Election Day.

A potential power shut-off, planned to prevent wildfires in high winds, might affect five California polling locations. But any shut-offs are forecast to come after polls close and polling centers have been provided with generators in case shut-offs happen.

This claim is False.",FALSE,image_244.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GbpQrPVWQAA9nif?format=jpg&name=large,Related,0.2638812661170959,"The image shows a screenshot of a tweet from @ChuckCallesto.  The tweet itself contains a graph depicting power outages in California on Election Day.  The claim ""Pacific Gas & Electric Co. deliberately shut off power “on Republican voters” in California on Election Day"" alleges partisan motivation behind PG&E's power shutoffs.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a low similarity score of 0.26 suggests a weak connection between the image and the claim.  This low score indicates that while there's a tangential relationship, the image doesn't directly support or refute the claim.  Here's a breakdown:

* **Relevance:** The image shows data related to power outages, a key element of the claim.  The fact that the outages occurred on Election Day adds further relevance.  The claim implies that these outages were targeted; the graph could potentially show geographic distribution of outages, which *could* be analyzed to check for partisan targeting.

* **Lack of Direct Support:**  The crucial weakness is that the graph itself doesn't reveal *why* the outages occurred or whether they were deliberately targeted at Republican voters. The graph only shows the *extent* of outages, not their cause or intended recipients.  There's no information about voter registration data overlaid on the outage map to show any correlation.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The low similarity score (0.26) reflects this lack of direct evidence.  The image provides context related to the claim, but doesn't offer any proof or disproof of the partisan motivation alleged.  The model likely identifies the overlap in the subject matter (power outages in California on Election Day) but doesn't find strong visual cues directly linking the outages to deliberate targeting of Republican voters.

In summary, the CLIP model's classification is reasonable.  The image offers a piece of potentially relevant data (the outage map), but doesn't provide any concrete evidence regarding the claim's core assertion of deliberate partisan targeting. The low similarity score accurately reflects the weak, indirect relationship between the image's content and the claim's highly specific allegation.  Further analysis, including comparing the outage map with voter registration data, would be necessary to assess the validity of the claim.

""Philadelphia city commissioners’ office tells non-citizens they can vote if they are Philly residents,"" read a Nov. 4 X post from O’Keefe Media Group, the creation of founder and former Project Veritas leader James O’Keefe.
In the video, O’Keefe — who left Project Veritas in 2023 when its board accused him of spending donor funds on ""personal luxuries""  — said he was standing outside a Philadelphia city commissioners’ office, where people were early voting. Across the street, he said, was a gathering of people from Ceiba, a nonprofit promoting economic development in Latino communities.
""They are telling people to vote,"" O’Keefe said in the video, appearing to refer to people associated with Ceiba. ""They are telling people that all you need is what is called an (ITIN) number.""
He then showed footage that he said showed an undercover reporter getting confirmation from the nonprofit and a county commissioner’s office worker that ""she can vote with nothing but an ITIN number"" and ""you only need to be a resident of Philadelphia.""

""ITIN"" refers to an individual taxpayer identification number, a nine-digit number the Internal Revenue Service issues to people filing tax returns who are not U.S. citizens and who do not have or are not eligible for Social Security numbers.

The video gained traction on X, with several leading conservatives, including conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, amplifying it as an example of election misconduct.

""This is the smoking gun of attempted election theft,"" Jones wrote.

""BREAKING: PENNSYLVANIA ELECTION FRAUD!"" wrote another X user who shared the post.

But this video does not show proof of noncitizen voting in the federal election. O’Keefe founded Project Veritas, a right-wing organization known for doing undercover reporting and using selectively edited videos. This video used a similar format. (O’Keefe was sued in 2021 and, following a settlement earlier this year, apologized for falsely claiming a postal worker committed voter fraud.)
Federal law requires voters be U.S. citizens to vote in federal elections, and although a small number of municipalities nationwide permit noncitizen voting in local races, Philadelphia is not among them.
""This report is incorrect and not supported at all by the facts,"" Philadelphia City Commissioner Seth Bluestein, a Republican, wrote Nov. 4  on X, responding to the O’Keefe video. ""Non-citizens are not eligible to vote in Philadelphia. A mail ballot provided by our office can only be counted after the voter verifies their ID, typically with a social security number or driver’s license number.""
Spokesperson Kevin Feeley sent PolitiFact a statement from the Philadelphia City Commissioners that described the video as ""selectively edited"" and said it showed ""a staffer at one of our Satellite Elections offices explaining voter eligibility requirements.""
""Noncitizens may not legally register to vote or cast a ballot anywhere in Pennsylvania, including Philadelphia,"" the spokesperson’s statement said.
Ceiba also addressed the video, writing on Instagram that its organization was ""targeted by an organized group of individuals who recorded our staff, and falsely accused us of registering non-citizens to vote.""

In a second Instagram statement, Ceiba added that one of its staff members incorrectly answered a question about whether ITINs can be used to vote. It said that does not align with its training or practice.

""Additionally, there is a system of checks and balances — with both mail ballots and in person voting that prevent a person from being able to vote using an ITIN.""
Pennsylvania voters who are voting for the first time in their election districts must show proof of identification, and an ITIN is not a valid proof of identity.
""The ITIN, used to help noncitizens to pay their taxes, is a distinct number and it is impossible for someone to use it to register to vote,"" Ceiba’s Instagram statement said.
As O’Keefe claimed Ceiba told people they could use ITIN numbers to vote, he showed a portion of a Spanish-language flier to the camera.
Ceiba Executive Director Will Gonzalez sent PolitiFact the ITIN brochure in both Spanish and English. Nowhere on the brochure does it say an ITIN can be used to vote.

The image shows a generic scene of poll workers sorting ballots on Election Day.  There is nothing in the image that directly or indirectly relates to the claim.  Here's a breakdown:

* **Absence of Key Elements:** The claim centers on conversations about *noncitizen voting* outside a specific location, the Philadelphia city commissioners' office. The image contains none of these elements.  There's no mention of Philadelphia, no indication of non-citizens being involved, and no depiction of conversations or activity outside an office building.

* **Generic Nature of the Image:** The image is a fairly typical photograph of election workers performing their duties. It's a general representation of election-related activity, lacking any specific details that would connect it to the claim's specifics (location, subject matter, alleged fraudulent activity).  The setting appears to be a standard election processing location, not the exterior of a city commissioners' office.

* **Lack of Contextual Clues:**  The image provides no textual or visual clues to suggest any irregularities or fraudulent activities.  There are no people visibly engaging in suspicious behavior, no signs of irregularities in the ballot handling process, and no identifying markers linking it to Philadelphia or any specific alleged instance of voter fraud.

* **Visual Similarity Score:** The low similarity score (0.25) reflects the lack of shared visual features between the image and the concept of the claim. CLIP likely compares visual features (people, objects, locations, activities) between the image and its internal representation of the claim's concept.  Since there's virtually no overlap, the score is low.

In summary, the image depicts a generic election-day scene, completely unrelated to the specific allegations of noncitizen voting conversations outside the Philadelphia city commissioners' office.  The CLIP model correctly identifies this lack of connection, resulting in the ""Unrelated"" classification and low similarity score.

The image itself shows a woman in the process of voting.  Crucially, it shows *nothing* about the ballot itself.

Here's a breakdown of why the image is unrelated:

* **Absence of Ballot Details:** The most important factor is the complete lack of any visible portion of a ballot.  The claim focuses specifically on the *text* on the ballot – the allegedly misspelled name of Donald Trump. The image provides no information about the content of any ballot. We can't see the names of candidates, any potential misspelling, or even the type of election.

* **Generic Voting Scene:** The image depicts a generic scene of someone voting. It's a common stock photo-type image that could be used to illustrate voting in any election, anywhere.  There's nothing specific to Ohio, to Donald Trump, or to a potential misspelling.

* **Focus on the Voter, Not the Ballot:** The focus of the image is on the woman voting. Her actions are relevant to the general concept of voting, but not to the specific claim about a misspelled name on an Ohio ballot.

* **CLIP's Visual Analysis:** CLIP, as a multimodal model, analyzes the image's visual content.  It likely detected features like a person, a voting booth (partially visible), and possibly some generic voting paraphernalia. These features are related to the general concept of voting but don't align with the specific detail of a misspelled name on a ballot.  The low similarity score reflects the lack of visual overlap between the image and the claim's core assertion.

In short, the image is visually unrelated to the specific claim.  It shows the act of voting, but offers no evidence or visual corroboration concerning the alleged misspelling of Donald Trump's name on Ohio ballots.  The low similarity score reflects this disconnect accurately.

This is not the first time federal agencies have reminded employees about conduct during elections. In 2020, during Trump’s presidency, the Defense Department reminded military service members about the uniform policy.
""All members of the armed forces, including active-duty members, members of the reserve components not on active duty, and retired members are prohibited from wearing military uniforms at political campaign or election events,"" a 2020 department reminder said.
Federal law prohibits military service members from interfering in election processes.
Some states, including New York and Maryland, also bar civilians from wearing military-style clothes at polling places.
The statement that ICE officials were told not to wear uniforms at the polls to not intimidate noncitizens voting contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. It reflects a longstanding law about civil law enforcement activity at polling places.

There's no visible uniform, badge, or any other overt indication of law enforcement affiliation.  This visually supports the claim that ICE officials were instructed not to wear their uniforms or badges while voting.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.30 suggests a moderate level of visual connection between the image and the claim.  The relatively low score (0.30 is not a high similarity) reflects the lack of explicit, irrefutable evidence in the image directly confirming the claim.  The image doesn't show an ICE official; it only shows a person dressed in civilian clothes in a polling place.  The connection is inferential: the image depicts a scenario consistent with the claim that ICE officials were instructed to dress in civilian clothes to avoid intimidation.

The claim focuses on the *absence* of a uniform and badge, which is harder for an image recognition model to ""see"" than the presence of specific objects. CLIP might struggle to definitively identify the lack of a uniform compared to identifying the presence of one.  It's more likely to detect the presence of a person in a polling place and make a weak association with the broader context of the claim regarding potential voter intimidation.  The image lacks text or other visual cues explicitly connecting the person to ICE.

In summary, the connection is based on the image showing a person in civilian clothing in a voting setting, which is *consistent* with the claim but doesn't provide definitive proof.  The low similarity score reflects the indirect nature of the visual evidence and the inherent difficulty in algorithmically detecting the absence of features (uniform, badge).  The image provides circumstantial support, but it's not strong visual evidence on its own to verify the claim.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a low similarity score (0.32) likely stems from a weak association between the image content and the claim.  The model might be making the connection based on:

* **The presence of ballots:** The image contains ballots, which are a key element mentioned in the claim. This establishes a basic semantic link.

* **Contextual understanding:** CLIP models are trained on vast datasets and may have learned to associate images of ballots with election-related news and controversies.  The claim itself might trigger this association.

However, the low similarity score (0.32) indicates the connection is weak.  The critical information missing from the image completely undermines the claim:

* **No indication of party affiliation:** The claim specifically mentions ""Republicans."" The image offers no visual evidence supporting this.
* **No evidence of ballots being ""made to disappear"":**  The image simply shows a stack of ballots.  It doesn't depict any act of discarding or destruction.
* **No year indicated:** The claim specifies ""2024,"" but the image offers no indication of the year these ballots are from.
* **No contextual information:** The image lacks any accompanying context that would link it to the alleged actions of a postal worker.

In conclusion, the CLIP model's ""Related"" classification is likely a result of a superficial association based on the presence of ballots in the image, which loosely relates to a key element in the claim.  However, the low similarity score reflects the lack of substantial evidence in the image to support the claim's specifics regarding party affiliation, timeframe, and the alleged attempt to ""make ballots disappear.""

Let's break down why the score is relatively low despite showing Trump and Melania:

* **The image shows Donald and Melania Trump, but not necessarily *voting*.** The image depicts them engaging in an activity seemingly related to the election process, possibly leaving a polling place, but it doesn't definitively show them casting a ballot.  The act of voting itself isn't visually depicted. This is a crucial discrepancy between the claim and the image's content.  CLIP likely recognized the Trumps but lacked the visual context to confirm the ""voting"" action.

* **Contextual ambiguity:** The image lacks clear visual cues confirming the specific election. While the clothing and the general context suggest a formal public appearance around election time, there's nothing explicitly stating it's the 2024 election.  This lack of explicit textual or visual cues reduces the confidence of the association.

* **Low similarity score (0.32):** This relatively low score indicates a moderate degree of relationship.  CLIP's scoring mechanism reflects the inherent ambiguity in the image regarding the claim. A higher score would necessitate a clearer visual representation of the voting act itself.

* **CLIP's limitations:** CLIP excels at associating images with text based on visual features and learned correlations. However, it struggles with nuanced understanding of human actions and contexts.  Distinguishing between ""being at a polling place"" and ""actively voting"" requires a level of visual interpretation that is challenging for CLIP.  The image might show them exiting a polling station or engaging in some other election-related activity, leaving ambiguity in the classification.

In summary, the image does show Donald and Melania Trump in a context plausibly related to an election, leading to a 'Related' classification.  However, the lack of definitive visual evidence of them *voting* in the 2024 election, combined with the inherent limitations of CLIP in interpreting complex human actions, results in a low similarity score.  The claim is partially supported by the image, but not conclusively proven by it.

The low similarity score of 0.27 from CLIP indicates a weak relationship between the image and the claim ""Melania Trump quietly endorses Kamala Harris for president.""  This is understandable for several reasons:

* **Absence of Kamala Harris:** The image contains no mention or depiction of Kamala Harris.  The claim directly involves Harris, yet she's entirely absent from the visual information.

* **Lack of Endorsement Indication:**  There's nothing in the image suggesting Melania Trump is endorsing anyone, let alone Kamala Harris.  There are no visible texts, symbols, or gestures that could be interpreted as an endorsement.  The somber expressions don't necessarily translate to a political endorsement of any kind.

* **Contextual Mismatch:** The claim implies a secret or quiet endorsement.  The image, however, offers no indication of secrecy or quietness. It's a fairly standard photograph of the Trumps together.  The context of the claim and the image are mismatched.

* **Negative Connotation:** The image, with the somewhat serious facial expressions, might even slightly *contradict* the claim. An endorsement, especially a ""quiet"" one, wouldn't typically be associated with such a neutral or potentially negative visual context.

The CLIP model likely assigned a ""Related"" classification with a low score (0.27) because:

1. **Shared Entities:** Both the claim and the image contain ""Melania Trump,"" a shared entity. This provides a minimal basis for a connection.

2. **Weak Semantic Link:**  The model might detect a weak semantic link between the claim's subject (Melania Trump's political actions) and the image's content (Melania Trump's presence). However, the link is incredibly weak due to the lack of direct evidence supporting the claim within the image.

In essence, the model recognizes Melania Trump in both the claim and the image, establishing a tenuous connection.  However, the complete absence of Kamala Harris and any indication of an endorsement results in a very low similarity score.  The relationship is purely based on the shared presence of Melania Trump, and not on any supportive evidence from the image itself.

El Pentágono no interviene en el envío de votos por correo. Cada estado es responsable de gestionar sus procesos electorales, dijo un portavoz del Pentágono en un correo electrónico a PolitiFact.
Para votar, los militares y sus cónyuges deben solicitar el voto en ausencia a sus estados de origen. Pueden hacerlo a través del Programa Federal de Asistencia para Votar del Departamento de Defensa. 
El programa ofrece ayuda para votar a los miembros del servicio militar, sus familias y otras personas que viven en el extranjero. Los votantes pueden utilizar la página web para registrarse para votar, solicitar boletas estatales y consultar las fechas y plazos de las elecciones.

The low similarity score of 0.25 suggests a weak relationship between the image and the claim, '""El Pentágono falló en enviar las boletas para el voto en ausencia al personal militar activo"" (The Pentagon failed to send absentee ballots to active military personnel).  Let's analyze why:

While the image *is* of an absentee ballot, it provides no information about whether it was sent by the Pentagon, whether it was received by active military personnel, or whether there was any failure in the process.  The image is simply a generic example of an absentee ballot.  It lacks any contextual information linking it to the Pentagon's actions or any potential failures in ballot distribution to the military.

The low similarity score (0.25) reflects this lack of direct connection. CLIP likely identified the ballot as relevant due to the keywords ""boletas"" (ballots) and ""voto en ausencia"" (absentee vote) in the claim. However, the visual information in the image doesn't support or refute the claim about the Pentagon's failure.  The image is simply a visual representation of a concept (absentee ballot) tangentially related to the claim's subject matter.  It lacks the crucial element connecting it to the claim: evidence of Pentagon involvement or a failure in its process.  Therefore, the relationship is weak, justifying the low similarity score.  The image is a visual example of a *type* of ballot relevant to the claim, but it offers no evidence regarding the claim's truthfulness.

The event’s original agenda said that the Department of Homeland Security was expected to participate in the drill — a tabletop exercise — but the federal agency wasn’t hosting this conference.
Rather, the event was organized by the Atlanta chapter of AFCEA international, a professional organization aimed in part at strengthening global security, and the Federal Business Council, a small business that ""specializes in producing meetings, conferences and trade show events for federal government agencies, the Department of Defense, and intelligence community throughout the United States,"" according to its website.

The CLIP model's classification of ""Unrelated"" with a low similarity score of 0.21 to the claim ""Homeland Security is having a cybersecurity drill on the same day as the election"" is justified due to a lack of visual connection.

Here's a breakdown:

* **Absence of Specifics:** The image shows people in a conference setting, possibly listening to a speaker or engaging in a discussion.  There's no mention of Homeland Security, a specific cybersecurity drill, or any reference to an election day.  The visual content is generic enough to apply to many cybersecurity conferences or discussions unrelated to the claimed event.

* **Generic Visual Elements:** The image primarily consists of people, chairs, and a presentation screen, which are all very common elements in conference settings.  These elements are not unique or indicative of a Homeland Security drill, an election-related event, or any specific type of activity.

* **Contextual Lack:** While the image's context hints at discussions related to cybersecurity and misinformation, it lacks the specific details necessary to establish a visual connection to the claim. There are no logos, banners, or presentations visible that clearly link the conference to Homeland Security or election-day activities.

* **Abstraction of the Claim:** The claim is a specific event: a Homeland Security cybersecurity drill on election day. This requires a high level of visual specificity to be connected to the image.  The image, while related to the broader topic of cybersecurity, doesn't provide any visual evidence of this specific event.


In essence, the CLIP model correctly identifies the image as unrelated because it lacks the specific visual cues that would link it to the precise event described in the claim.  The image is about the general theme of cybersecurity and disinformation, but it doesn't visually represent the specific claim of a Homeland Security drill on election day. The low similarity score reflects this lack of visual overlap.

The low similarity score (0.32) further reinforces this.

The image shows a woman who bears a resemblance to Melania Trump. She is wearing sunglasses indoors, which is somewhat unusual and might be considered slightly out of character for a public appearance by Melania Trump, potentially contributing to the suspicion of an imposter in the minds of some.  This aspect may be what triggered the association with the claim.

However, the image lacks any contextual information whatsoever. There's no date, location, or other individuals present to confirm or deny whether this is Melania Trump or not, or if she's even at a polling station.  The image provides only a visual representation of a woman who looks somewhat like Melania Trump.  The sunglasses could be interpreted as a deliberate attempt at disguise (which plays into the imposter narrative), but this is purely speculative.

The classification is likely due to:

* **Facial Similarity:** The woman's facial features bear a sufficient resemblance to Melania Trump to trigger a connection in CLIP. This is the most likely reason for the weak ""Related"" classification.  The model identifies visual similarities without understanding context.
* **Ambiguity:** The unusual context (sunglasses indoors) introduces ambiguity that might contribute to the connection.  The model associates the unusualness with the suspicion suggested in the claim.

In conclusion, the relationship is tenuous.  The image provides only a minimal visual similarity to Melania Trump.  The lack of contextual evidence makes the ""Related"" classification weak and unreliable. The low similarity score confirms this lack of strong connection.  The model is simply recognizing a facial resemblance without being able to verify the claim.  It's crucial to remember that CLIP is an image-text model; it doesn't possess reasoning capabilities to verify the claim's truth.  More concrete evidence, such as a time-stamped photo of the event or eyewitness accounts, is needed to confirm or refute the claim.

There is no state or federal law that says vote counting must stop the same day polls close, PolitiFact has reported.
States have different deadlines for when mail ballots must be received and counted: 
Thirty states require mail ballots to be received by Election Day. Eighteen states, including Nevada, will count ballots after Election Day if they are postmarked on or before that day.
Nevada’s election must be certified at the local and county level within 10 days of the election and at the state level by the fourth Tuesday of November. Although media outlets such as The Associated Press may call a race for a candidate on Election Day or soon after, results aren’t official until states certify their results.

The low similarity score reflects the fact that the image doesn't directly and explicitly support or refute the claim. The connection is indirect and requires interpretation.  The image only presents a piece of the legal framework, not a definitive answer.

Here's a breakdown of why the image is considered related:

* **Focus on Absentee Ballot Receipt:** The image centers on a portion of Nevada's election law concerning absentee ballots.  The claim focuses on the counting of ballots *after* the election, implying absentee ballots.  This overlap in subject matter creates a link.

* **No Postmark Requirement (implied):** While the image doesn't explicitly say ""no postmark required,"" it deals with the criteria for counting absentee ballots.  A careful reading of the full code section (which is partially visible) would be needed to determine whether a postmark is a condition for counting.  The absence of a clear statement about postmarks in *this specific excerpt* contributes to the relevance, albeit weakly.  The absence of information doesn't disprove the claim, but neither does it directly support it.

* **Contextual Relevance:** The image’s source, Politifact, suggests that the image is being used in the context of fact-checking claims about Nevada's election procedures.  This contextual information heavily influences the relevance assigned by CLIP.  The model likely recognizes the Politifact logo and infers the image's purpose within the context of election verification.

In summary, the CLIP model likely classified the image as ""Related"" because of the thematic connection between the image's content (Nevada election law regarding absentee ballots) and the claim (concerning the postmarking and counting of Nevada ballots). The low similarity score accurately reflects the weak, indirect nature of this relationship.  The image provides relevant context but does not directly confirm or deny the claim; further investigation of the full legal code is required to assess the claim's veracity.

The claim alleges that Raskin stated he would prevent a Trump victory even if Trump won the popular vote. The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.32 suggests a weak but detectable connection between the image and the claim.  The low similarity score indicates that the connection is not strong, likely due to the absence of explicit textual or visual evidence directly supporting the claim within the image itself.

The reason for the classification is solely the presence of Jamie Raskin. The image provides visual confirmation of the subject of the claim.  Since the claim explicitly mentions Raskin, the image's sole relevance is its depiction of him.  There's nothing in the image to corroborate or refute the specific statement attributed to him.  The image only establishes a connection by showing the person who is the subject of the quote.

The low similarity score (0.32) accurately reflects this limited connection.  A higher score would require the image to contain further elements related to the claim's content, such as a news headline, a protest, or some visual indication of the alleged plan to prevent Trump from taking office.  The image lacks such visual context.  Therefore, the relationship is purely based on the identification of the individual mentioned in the claim.  The model correctly identifies the presence of the individual but does not confirm the veracity of the quoted statement.

County and state officials confirmed on Election Day morning that Cambria County, Pennsylvania, vote tabulating machines were unable to scan ballots because of technical issues. Later that afternoon, county officials said the issue was caused by a ballot printing error, which made the ballots unreadable by tabulators, according to local NBC affiliate WJAC-TV. 
The issue was corrected by Tuesday afternoon, WJAC reported, and the county’s polling places were supplied with new ballots that were able to be tabulated and processed by the machines. 
Before the issue was resolved, voters were still able to fill out paper ballots and securely cast them. 
The ballots that were cast before the issue was resolved will be hand counted, Cambria County Solicitor Ron Repak told WJAC. Voters who used an electronic ballot marking device, rather than filling out a paper ballot, also had no problem casting their ballot, local officials said.

The concern led some social media users to claim the delays were evidence of election fraud. One X post said, ""The election steal is happening,"" pointing to the reported issues.
The Pennsylvania Department of State wrote Nov. 5 on X it was aware of the issues and was working to resolve them. The department said voters were still casting paper ballots.
""The Department of State is in contact with county officials in Cambria County,"" Pennsylvania Department of State spokesperson Amy Gulli told PolitiFact. ""Voters are continuing to vote by paper ballot, in accordance with normal operations, while the county resolves the issue with in-precinct scanning.""
With more than 3,000 counties across the United States, each with different systems for recording and counting votes, technical issues sometimes happen. But there’s no evidence the problems are evidence of an ""election steal,"" as some social media users claimed. 
Around 69,800 people voted in Cambria County in 2020, which former President Donald Trump won by 37 percentage points. The county, about 60 miles east of Pittsburgh, has a population of about 133,500.
A Pennsylvania judge approved a petition from the Cambria County Board of Elections to extend voting two hours, to 10 p.m., because of the issues. The extension applies only to Cambria County.

Cambria County uses voting systems from Election Systems & Software, known as ES&S, one of five approved vendors in the state.

While the graphic mentions a recount and potential errors, it doesn't explicitly state or imply a widespread ""election steal"" as claimed in the statement. This is the key reason why CLIP classified the image as ""Unrelated"" with a low similarity score of 0.25.

Let's break down why the visual elements support the low similarity score:

* **Absence of Fraudulent Activity:** The image shows a factual report of a *technical error*, not evidence of intentional fraudulent activity. The wording implies a problem with the *process* of counting ballots, not manipulation of the results to favor a particular candidate.  The claim of ""election steal"" necessitates evidence of deliberate and malicious actions to alter election outcomes; the image depicts nothing of the sort.

* **Neutral Tone:** The graphic's design is fairly neutral and journalistic in style.  There are no inflammatory visuals or suggestive language that would link it to the conspiracy theory of an ""election steal.""  A claim of such magnitude usually accompanies highly charged imagery or explicitly accusatory text – neither is present here.

* **Focus on Technical Issue:** The image focuses on the recount and the technical issue of ballot scanning, which is a common occurrence and not necessarily indicative of fraud. Recounts happen routinely to ensure accuracy, not to expose large-scale conspiracies.

* **Lack of Supporting Evidence:**  The image doesn't present any evidence to support the claim of an ""election steal.""  It merely reports a problem with the ballot-scanning process – a fact that could be explained by numerous factors besides malicious intent.

In summary, the claim is a highly charged, conspiratorial statement alleging widespread fraud.  The image, however, presents a neutral, factual report of a technical issue.  These two are entirely different concepts, hence the low similarity score from CLIP.  The model correctly identifies the lack of visual connection between the factual reporting of a technical problem and the accusatory claim of a stolen election.

But some social media users misconstrued this as proof of widespread interference in the 2024 election.
An Oct. 30 Instagram post shared a video of Benson answering a question at an Oct. 28 press briefing about a problem with split-ticket voting using a specific type of Dominion voting machine. Benson initially said the programming issue was ""a nationwide issue,"" but her office and Dominion clarified Oct. 30 this was happening only in Michigan.

""According to (Benson’s) office, this ‘programming issue’ CANNOT be fixed, and voters are being forced to deal with it,"" the X user wrote. This X post received millions of views.
The Michigan Department of State said in an Oct. 25 statement that the programming snag has made voting more inconvenient for some voters, but it hasn’t prevented any voters from casting ballots.
The problem is specific to voters using Dominion’s voter assist terminals, or VATs, which are designed to help voters with disabilities, the department said. All Michigan voting locations are required to have voter assist terminals, but not all of the state’s voting machines are designed by Dominion. Sixty-five of Michigan’s 83 counties use Dominion voting equipment.
If a voter using this type of machine selects the ""straight-party"" option to vote for all candidates of one party, but then decides to vote for a candidate of a different party, the voter will receive an error message, the state department said.
To fix the problem, ""the voter will need to go back and de-select their straight-party selection and vote for candidates in the races individually or vote straight party without splitting their ticket,"" the state department said.
Dominion issued a statement Oct. 25 with similar instructions for Michigan voters using the voter assist terminals.
""Voters seeking to vote for a single party for all contests can use the straight-party option,"" Dominion said. ""Voters seeking to split their ticket by choosing one or more candidates of a different political party should be advised not to select the straight-party voting option.""

Dominion said in an Oct. 30 statement that this programming error was not happening with voter assist terminals in other states that have straight-ticket voting. The voting equipment company said the Michigan secretary of state’s office updated its website Oct. 30 to clarify that the problem was specific to Michigan.
In Michigan, voters typically have the option to vote straight-party but then override their party selection for individual races, the state department said.
Voters will be able to review their selections before printing their ballots and putting them in the scanner for tabulation, the state department said.
The state department said it’s impossible to fix the voter assist terminals’ programming this close to Election Day, but the problem will be corrected for future elections.
""Although the issue will not stop people from voting or making their preferred selections, and it will not change anyone’s votes, it will make the process more inconvenient for some voters using the VATs,"" the state department said.

An Instagram post claimed, ""It’s now been confirmed by Dominion that their voting machines have a programming issue that will affect vote counts.""
Michigan voters using Dominion’s voter assist terminals who select straight-ticket voting and then decide to vote across party lines will receive an error message because of a programming issue, the Michigan State Department said. This can be fixed by deselecting the straight-ticket voting option and choosing candidates individually, or by voting only for candidates of the same political party.
The Michigan Department of State said the programming error could be inconvenient to voters, but it won’t block them from casting ballots. All voters will be able to cast ballots with their chosen candidates. Dominion did not say this problem will affect vote counts.

The image shows a scene at a polling place – likely on election day.  There are people standing in line to vote, indicating an active election process.

The claim, however, focuses on a *specific alleged internal technical issue* within Dominion voting machines.  The image contains absolutely nothing visually related to this claim:

* **No voting machines are visible:** The photograph shows only people waiting to vote, and the environment of a polling place.  There's no depiction of Dominion voting machines, their software, or any technical component that would relate to a programming issue.

* **No indication of a programming issue:** The image conveys nothing about software glitches, errors, or any technical malfunction. It's a general scene of an election in progress, lacking any details that would support or contradict the claim.

* **No textual reference to Dominion or programming issues:** The image does not include any text mentioning Dominion, voting machines, or programming errors.

Therefore, the low similarity score (0.25) accurately reflects the lack of visual connection between the image and the claim. The image simply depicts a generic scene of voters at a polling place, while the claim alleges a specific technical problem with a particular brand of voting machine.  These are entirely separate concepts, making the ""Unrelated"" classification appropriate.  The CLIP model correctly identifies the absence of any visual overlap between the two.

The Pentagon has no role in sending absentee ballots. Each state is responsible for managing their election processes, a Pentagon spokesperson said in an email to PolitiFact.

Military service members and their spouses must request absentee ballots from their home states to vote. They can do so through the Defense Department’s Federal Voting Assistance Program. 
The program provides voting assistance for service members, their families and other people living overseas. Voters can use the site to register to vote, request state ballots and navigate election dates and deadlines.
Webb’s X post, which was tagged with a community note pointing out that the Pentagon doesn’t send ballots, provides more context behind the claim. Webb responded to the note by pointing to an Oct. 30 letter sent by Reps. Brian Mast, R-Fla., Bill Huizenga, R-Mich., and Mike Waltz R-Fla., to U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.
The representatives said in the letter that active-duty service members had raised concerns about the Pentagon’s ""inadequate education"" on how to vote and that when some members whose mail ballots did not arrive in time requested a federal write-in ballot, they were told the base had run out. Webb, in another X post, said the Pentagon is responsible for providing those ballots.

A service member using that ballot doesn’t need to request it from their military base. They can print the ballots out themselves from the Federal Voting Assistance Program website. The program’s website on Nov. 5 included information on how to access the backup ballot.

It contains bar charts representing various categories like ""Requested,"" ""Returned,"" and possibly others.  There is text providing context, labels for the charts, and potentially data related to voter turnout.

The crucial reason for the low similarity score and ""Unrelated"" classification is the **lack of any direct connection to the Pentagon, active military service members, or the specific issue of ballot delivery failures**. The image deals with general absentee ballot statistics at a state level, a much broader topic.  It doesn't provide any information about the source of the ballots, whether they were sent to military personnel, or if there were any failures in delivery.  To establish relevance to the claim, the image would need to explicitly show data specifically regarding absentee ballots sent to or received from active military personnel, and ideally, demonstrate a deficiency in the process.

The CLIP model, trained to understand visual and textual relationships, correctly identifies the disconnect. The claim points to a specific problem (ballot delivery failure) within a specific population (active military) and a specific entity (the Pentagon). The image offers general, state-level data on absentee ballots, entirely lacking these specific elements.  Therefore, the low similarity score and ""Unrelated"" classification are accurate reflections of the lack of visual-textual overlap.

The image from Variety shows Donald and Melania Trump, likely from around the 2016 election (given the context of the article it's from), and contains absolutely no visual elements related to voting in 2024. There's no ballot, polling station, voting machine, ""I Voted"" sticker, or anything even remotely suggestive of an electoral process. The only connection is the presence of Donald Trump himself.

The model's ""Related"" classification is almost certainly due to the presence of Donald Trump.  CLIP's capabilities are based on associating visual elements with textual descriptions.  Since the text mentions Donald Trump, and the image shows Donald Trump, the model establishes a weak link.  However, it completely fails to consider the context and discrepancies:

* **Time Discrepancy:** The image is clearly from a much earlier time than 2024.
* **Location Discrepancy:** The image offers no information about the location.
* **Activity Discrepancy:** The image depicts no voting activity whatsoever.

The image shows a fairly generic scene of voters at a polling place in Gwinnett County, Georgia.  There is nothing in the image directly or indirectly related to:

* **White supremacists:** The image contains no visible symbols, individuals, or paraphernalia associated with white supremacist groups.  There are no visible swastikas, Confederate flags, or other hate symbols.
* **Planned attacks:**  The image depicts a peaceful voting process. There's no indication of violence, weapons, or any preparations for an attack.
* **Specific targets:**  The image doesn't show any identifiable Black individuals who could be construed as potential targets of an attack. The voters are diverse but their ethnicity isn't readily apparent from the image resolution.

The image simply shows people engaged in the civic duty of voting. It's a commonplace scene that has no connection whatsoever to the specific, alarming claim about planned attacks by white supremacists. The CLIP model correctly identifies the semantic gap between the peaceful act of voting and the violent threat described in the claim.  The low similarity score reflects this significant disconnect.  The image's relevance to the claim is purely coincidental – it only shares the location (Gwinnett County, Georgia).  The content of the image is completely unrelated to the nature of the claim.

The low score indicates a weak relationship.  Let's break down why:

The claim states Reeves is holding an *anti*-Trump shirt, while the image clearly shows him holding a shirt with a pro-Trump message.  This is the primary reason for the low similarity score.  While the image shows Reeves holding a shirt, the *content* of the shirt directly contradicts the claim.  The shirt features pro-Trump imagery and text, making the claim false.

The 0.33 score isn't zero because CLIP likely identifies common elements:

* **Keanu Reeves:** The presence of the famous actor is a strong visual element shared by both the claim and the image.  This contributes positively to the similarity score, although it's insufficient to overcome the contradictory message on the shirt.
* **A Shirt:** Both the claim and the image involve Keanu Reeves holding a piece of clothing. This shared feature, however, is very generic and adds minimal weight to the overall similarity.
* **The Act of Holding:** The action of holding something is also present in both, again a very general element.

However, these shared elements are overshadowed by the crucial difference: the political message on the shirt. The semantic understanding of the text on the shirt (""Trump 2024"") is central to the image's meaning and directly refutes the claim's assertion of an anti-Trump message.

In summary, CLIP identifies some superficial visual similarities (Reeves, holding a shirt), but the core discrepancy – the pro-Trump nature of the shirt versus the claimed anti-Trump message – drastically reduces the similarity score. The low score correctly reflects the substantial mismatch between the claim and the image's content. The model is demonstrating its ability to differentiate between visual elements and their semantic meaning.

In late August 2021, conservative websites, pundits and politicians, such as U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, claimed that the Taliban had hanged someone from a helicopter flying over Afghanistan.

The image shows a protest scene, likely related to the January 6th Capitol riot, but crucially **does not depict a banner photo of Joe Biden being hung from a helicopter.**

Here's a breakdown of why the low similarity score is accurate:

* **Absence of Joe Biden:** The image contains no recognizable depiction of Joe Biden. There are individuals in the crowd, but none resemble him.

* **Absence of a Banner:**  While there are signs and banners visible in the image, none of them portray Joe Biden in the described context.  The banners show various messages and symbols related to the protest, but none feature Biden being hung from a helicopter.

* **Absence of a Helicopter:**  The image does not show a helicopter at all.  The claim specifically mentions a helicopter as a key element of the alleged banner photo.

* **General Scene vs. Specific Claim:** The image depicts a chaotic and busy protest scene.  The claim, however, is very specific – a *banner photo of Joe Biden being hung from a helicopter*.  The image's general nature is vastly different from the specificity of the claim.  CLIP excels at identifying visual similarities to text descriptions, and the lack of any of the specific elements mentioned in the claim results in a low similarity score.

* **Contextual Understanding:**  While a human might recognize the image as relating to the political climate surrounding Donald Trump Jr. and Joe Biden, and thus infer a loose connection, CLIP does not possess this contextual knowledge.  It relies solely on direct visual comparisons between the image and the textual description, and finds no direct match.  The low similarity score reflects the absence of any of the key visual elements described in the claim.

In summary, the low similarity score (0.20) accurately reflects the lack of visual overlap between the image and the claim.  The image shows a general protest scene, while the claim describes a highly specific and absent image.  CLIP's assessment is based purely on visual elements and not on broader political context.

""Kari Lake is threatening Social Security and Medicare, taking the benefits we earned,"" a Facebook and Instagram ad from WinSenate, a Democratic political action committee, said. 
According to Meta’s Ad Library, the ad started running Oct. 24. We previously fact-checked WinSenate in October for a different claim about the Pennsylvania Senate race.
This claim about Lake needs context. 
On one hand, Lake has vowed to not touch funding for Social Security and Medicare, according to reporting from The Arizona Republic. She also said she will ""never vote to reduce or hurt Social Security"" during an Association of Mature American Citizens forum in May.

At the same event, however, she proposed overhauling the federal budget. 
""I think we can slash the federal government by 50%. Most of it is grossly overweighted with employees that are doing nothing,"" Lake said.
In July, Lake raised her proposed budget cuts to ""50% to 75%"" in remarks to the Payson Tea Party in northern Arizona, according to the Payson Roundup, a local news outlet. Later that month, Lake won the Republican primary to face off against Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego. 
It’s unclear whether Lake meant that 50% to 75% cut to refer to the entire federal budget, or everything left over after retaining Social Security. Lake’s campaign did not respond to PolitiFact’s multiple requests to clarify her position.
In 2023, the federal budget was about $6.1 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Of that, Social Security accounts for about 14%, with Medicare accounting for an additional 21%. So, if she meant cutting 50% to 75% of the entire federal budget, it would be hard to avoid cutting one or both programs.
Even if she intended to protect Social Security in full and cut 50% to 75% of everything else, then those cuts would be massive. The discretionary part of the budget, which doesn’t include mandatory programs, such as Social Security and Medicare, exceeds $1.7 trillion, roughly half for defense programs and half for everything else the government does.

Our ruling
A pro-Democratic groupsaid Lake ""is threatening Social Security and Medicare."" 
Lake has said on several occasions that she won’t cut the two programs. 
However, she has called for a 50% to 75% reduction in the federal budget, without specifying how that fits with her intention to protect Social Security. At the high end of that range, Social Security and Medicare funding would be at risk for cuts.

The key elements are Lake herself, a crowd of supporters, and a backdrop featuring some indistinct text and possibly campaign branding. There are no visible elements directly related to Social Security or Medicare.  No mention of these programs is made in the image itself.

The CLIP model's classification of ""Unrelated"" with a low similarity score (0.24) is entirely justified because the image provides purely visual context of a political rally.  There's nothing in the picture to visually support or refute the claim that Lake is threatening Social Security and Medicare.  The claim itself is a statement about policy and potential future actions, while the image is a snapshot of a moment in Lake's campaign.

The disconnect lies in the difference between the claim (a statement about policy and its potential impact) and the image (a depiction of a campaign event).  The image provides no visual information related to the claim's core subject matter – the programs of Social Security and Medicare and their potential endangerment.  To visually represent the claim, the image would need to show something directly relevant, such as Lake speaking about policy changes to those programs, documents referencing such changes, or visual elements symbolizing cuts to the programs.  The absence of any such elements explains the low similarity score and the ""Unrelated"" classification.  The image only shows Lake in a general campaign setting; it offers no visual evidence regarding the claim.

Therefore, the CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.28 is surprisingly low and indicates a weak association. The only possible reason for this weak connection is the presence of Elon Musk himself.  The model likely identifies Musk in the image and connects it to the claim solely based on the fact that Musk is mentioned in both.  This is a superficial connection, lacking any semantic relationship between the image content and the claim's subject matter.  The low similarity score (0.28) further reinforces this weak link.  It suggests that the model isn't confident in the relationship and is primarily relying on the presence of Musk as the only shared element.  Essentially, it's a weak association based on a single, superficial shared entity rather than any contextual or conceptual similarity.  The claim is about a specific technological development, while the image is a generic portrait of Musk in a public speaking context.  The model's weakness in discerning this crucial difference leads to the inaccurate – albeit weakly associated – classification.

""The United States Postal Service recently changed the delivery method of absentee mail-in ballots!"" Peter Bernegger wrote in an Oct. 27 post. ""They are hiding the evidence of absentee mail-in ballot fraud - by not allowing the evidence to be created in the first place.""
In a nearly 400-word post, Bernegger accused the Postal Service of improperly directed post offices ""to NOT send absentee mail-in ballots to central sort. But instead take them to the election clerks."" He said that meant ""no electronic ballot images are being created,"" which he argued amounted to intentionally hiding fraud. 
Bernegger, based in Wisconsin, has rejected the 2020 election’s results. Since 2020, he has filed numerous lawsuits against local election offices, accusing them of fraud while promoting his litigation and false election fraud claims online, The Guardian reported. The Wisconsin Elections Commission in 2022 fined Bernegger more than $2,400 for making frivolous election complaints. 
In February, Wisconsin prosecutors accused Bernegger of falsifying a subpoena for an election-related case, and he was charged with ""simulating legal process,"" a felony. The criminal case against him continues.

Bernegger shared his post to the ""Election Integrity"" Community that Musk’s Political Action Committee created on X. Since it was established Oct. 21, the group has amassed over 60,000 members, many of whom circulate inaccurate election narratives, including multiple claims we have fact-checked. 
We contacted Bernegger on X and by email through his organization, Election Watch, but received no response.
(Screenshot from X)
Bernegger’s post provided no evidence to support his claim. He included an image of a letter from the Postal Service that said the agency found no documents that would satisfy his Freedom of Information Act records request for ""all the electronic images of all absentee mail-in ballots"" sent by municipal and county clerks in Wisconsin from Sept. 17 to Oct. 14. He also attributed the alleged changes to Amber McReynolds, the U.S. Postal Service’s Board of Governors’ vice chair and a President Joe Biden appointee. 
We searched using Google and the Nexis news archive, and found no credible reports or information supporting the claim that McReynolds advocated for mail ballots delivery changes in 2024. We also found no credible reports that the Postal Service had made changes to its procedures for mail ballots. 
U.S. Postal Service spokesperson Martha Johnson told PolitiFact that the Postal Service has not ""recently changed the delivery method of absentee ballots"" as the posts claim. The Postal Service has used the same procedures for previous general elections, she said. 
U.S. Postal Service’s ""extraordinary measures"" for election mail aren’t new
As it has in past election years, the Postal Service on Oct. 21 launched what it describes as ""extraordinary measures"" that Johnson said are ""designed to accelerate the delivery of ballots mailed close to Election Day.""
The measures include additional collections, extra deliveries, special sorting plans on processing equipment and a different way of handling mailed ballots, Johnson said.
""Under normal operations, any piece of mail, including an absentee ballot, is handled and postmarked at the processing facility closest to its originating post office and, depending on how far it is going, will be handled again at one or more processing facilities closer to its (destination) post office,"" Johnson said. 
Under the special election year process, however, mailed ballots addressed to a local or nearby election office ""will bypass the processing operation and will instead be postmarked at the local unit and delivered to the election office,"" Johnson said. ""This is consistent with our practice in previous general elections."" 
The agency’s 2020 press release used the same ""extraordinary measures"" language. We also found a more detailed October 2020 memorandum that detailed similar provisions, including one authorizing local post offices to postmark and deliver ballots to boards of elections ""rather than the ballots being placed into the automation flow."" A September 2022 memo said the agency would employ the same ""extraordinary measures"" as it had in 2020. 
A mail-in official ballot for the 2024 general election in the United States is shown Oct. 8, 2024, in Pennsylvania. (AP)
Barbara Smith Warner, executive director of the National Vote at Home Institute, said the special procedures for ballots are ""well known"" and ""regularly implemented"" among Postal Service offices and personnel across the country. 
""The extraordinary measures process is established for every general election, and was not done out of the blue,"" she said. 
In 2024, the Postal Service’s ""extraordinary measures"" for election mail started earlier, but they ""are the same or mostly the same"" as the measures in 2020 and 2022, said Amy Cohen, who works closely with state election officials nationwide as executive director of the National Association of State Election Directors.

Cohen added that although the measures mean some ballots don’t go to processing facilities, ""keeping election mail local helps it move faster through the system."" 
There might not be digital images of ballot envelopes, but that doesn’t equal fraud
If ballots bypass automated processing, the Postal Service may not generate electronic images of the ballot envelopes as it usually would as part of its informed delivery service, according to the agency’s website. Informed delivery is an opt-in Postal Service program that sends image previews of incoming Postal Service mail. Those images, however, ""are only provided for letter-sized mailpieces that are processed through USPS's automated equipment,"" the Postal Service website says. 
But there’s no evidence that a lack of images signals fraud. 
Brenden Donahue, U.S. assistant postal inspector in charge at the United States Postal Inspection Service, told PolitiFact it does not threaten election security when digital images of ballot envelopes aren’t created. 
""The Postal Service utilizes a variety of robust measures, processes, and procedures to ensure the safe, secure, and timely delivery of our nation’s Election Mail, including ballots,"" Donahue said. ""The capture of mail piece images are not one of those standard measures, processes, or procedures.""
Experts told PolitiFact that the Postal Service works alongside election officials across the U.S. and has built on its experience and honed its processes over time. 
Michael Alvarez, political and computational social science at Caltech and co-director of the Caltech/MIT Voting Technology Project, said he has recently enabled webinar conversations with numerous election officials who’ve discussed mail ballots and the Postal Service.
During those discussions, those election officials raised ""no concerns"" about ""any changes in the USPS delivery of mail ballots,"" Alvarez said.
Our ruling
An X post said ""the United States Postal Service recently changed the delivery method of absentee mail-in ballots"" to hide ""the evidence of absentee mail-in ballot fraud.""
Close to Election Day, the Postal Service handles mailed ballots differently than other mail, but this procedure isn’t new. Election experts and a Postal Service spokesperson said that the agency has made similar changes to ensure prompt delivery of election mail in previous elections including in 2020 and 2022. 
A Postal Service spokesperson rebutted claims that the agency’s special measures for election mail signal fraud, saying that the measures intend to speed ballot mail delivery.

The claim alleges a malicious intent behind these changes – to conceal evidence of fraud.  The low similarity score (0.27) reflects the weak direct connection between the image and the claim, despite a thematic relevance.

Here's a breakdown of why CLIP might classify the image as 'Related' with a low score:

* **Thematic Relevance:** The image directly addresses the USPS's changes to mail delivery methods, a core component of the claim. The graphic likely illustrates specific changes in routes, processing centers, or other logistical aspects.  This shared topic makes the image thematically relevant.

* **Lack of Explicit Evidence of Fraud:** The image itself doesn't show any evidence of fraud.  It's purely descriptive of logistical changes.  The claim, however, accuses the USPS of *intentionally* implementing these changes to hide fraud.  This crucial element – the alleged intent to conceal evidence – is entirely absent from the visual data.  This lack of visual representation of the accusation significantly lowers the similarity score.

* **Abstract Nature of the Claim:** The claim involves a complex accusation of deliberate action (concealment of evidence) motivated by a specific intent (to cover up fraud).  Visual representation of intent and fraud is inherently difficult.  The image, being primarily a factual representation of logistical alterations, cannot directly visually corroborate or refute such an abstract claim.

* **Limited Visual Detail:**  Without seeing the image itself, we can only speculate on its level of detail. If the graphic simply shows broad changes in delivery routes or processing times without specifying why, it provides minimal evidence either supporting or refuting the claim of intentional concealment. More detailed graphics showing specific changes impacting ballot delivery *might* achieve a higher similarity score.


In essence, the relationship is one of topical connection, not direct visual support.  The image provides context regarding the mentioned USPS changes but offers no visual evidence regarding the alleged fraudulent activity or the intention to conceal it.  This discrepancy explains the low similarity score despite the thematic relevance. The score reflects that the image only indirectly relates to the claim's core assertion of intentional fraud concealment.

Peanut the squirrel and Fred were both seized by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation from their owner Mark Longo. Longo had cared for the squirrel for seven years. An Instagram account dedicated to Peanut the squirrel has more than 700,000 followers. Officials said the two animals were put down to test for rabies after Peanut bit a person involved in the investigation.

  But Trump did not release this statement, a review of Trump's campaign website and social media accounts show.
  Although Trump has not released a statement on Peanut, his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, has used language similar to the fake statement’s when talking about Peanut and said Trump was ""fired up"" about the euthanization of the animals.
  ""The same government that doesn't care about hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrant criminals coming into our country, doesn't want us to have pets,"" Vance said at a Nov. 3 rally in Sanford, North Carolina.
  We reached out to the Trump campaign but did not receive a reply. A spokesperson told The New York Post the statement was fake.
  Approved rabies testing in animals requires that the animal be euthanized, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.

The image shows Donald Trump at a press conference or similar event. There is no mention of ""Peanut the squirrel,"" euthanasia, or any condemnation of such an act.

Here's a breakdown of why the low similarity score is accurate:

* **Absence of Key Elements:** The image lacks any textual or visual elements directly referencing ""Peanut the squirrel"" or euthanasia.  There's no sign of a written statement, press release, or even a news graphic mentioning the squirrel. The image focuses solely on Trump, his expression, and the setting of a public appearance.

* **Contextual Mismatch:**  The claim implies a specific event – Trump issuing a statement about a squirrel's euthanasia. The image, however, shows a generic scene of Trump at a public event. There's no contextual clue suggesting this particular event is related to such a statement.  Even if Trump *did* make such a statement, it's highly improbable it would be visually represented in this image.  The image offers no supporting context for the claim.

* **Low Visual Similarity:** CLIP models analyze both visual and semantic features.  While the image contains Trump (a recognizable element), the semantic meaning connected to the claim is entirely absent. The image's visuals are unrelated to the specific and unusual event described in the claim.  The low similarity score (0.25) reflects this lack of visual and semantic overlap.

* **Generalizability of Trump Images:**  Many images of Donald Trump exist. CLIP is trained on vast datasets.  The model likely has seen many similar pictures of Trump at press conferences or other events, none of which are inherently related to a statement about a squirrel's euthanasia.  The model correctly identifies this image as just another generic image of Trump, lacking the specifics required by the claim.

In summary, the low similarity score is a correct assessment.  The image depicts Donald Trump in a general context, while the claim refers to a highly specific and unusual event for which there's no visual evidence in the provided image. The discrepancy between the visual content and the semantic meaning of the claim explains the ""Unrelated"" classification.

A photo of a Kentucky ballot shared in a Nov. 3 Facebook post appears to have a printed dot in the box next to Harris’ name, and social media users claimed a vote for any other candidate ""will be void"" because of the dot. The social media posts instructed voters to request new ballots if they see similar marks. 
Although the photo shows a Kentucky ballot, social media users in other states, including Ohio, Pennsylvania and Alabama, shared the same image with the same text and the same warning. 
The post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)

In a Nov. 4 statement, the Kentucky State Board of Elections said neither it nor the state attorney general’s office had received any reports or complaints of mail-in absentee ballots or early in-person absentee ballots with preprinted marks in the candidate selection fields as of Nov. 4. Republican Secretary of State Michael G. Adams oversees the Board of Elections, which includes four Democratic and four Republican members.
""As no one has presented a pre-marked ballot to election administrators or law enforcement, the claim that at least one ballot may have had a pre-printed mark in Kentucky, currently only exists in the vacuum of social media,"" the board said in the statement. 
If a ballot did have the mark shown in the photo, it would be unlikely to be counted as a vote, state officials said. 
Whether tabulators would read the dot shown in the photo as a vote depends on the local equipment’s settings, Taylor Brown, the general counsel for the Kentucky State Board of Elections, said. Generally, Brown said, the machine settings would have to be very sensitive to detect a dot of that size.
Administrative rules in Kentucky define what types of marks constitute a vote, and a small dot is not among the definitions in the law.
If a ballot is flagged as having too many selections for one office — which is called an overvote — county officials also have leeway to determine voter intent. If a mail-in ballot had a full box filled in and a small dot in a different box, county officials could interpret the full box as the voter’s selection, Brown said.
""The law says the two selections have to be ‘similarly marked’ (to constitute an overvote), and a small, single dot is not recognized as one of the markings that constitutes a vote,"" Brown said.
Also, when voting by mail, if voters mark more than one candidate choice in ink, they can circle their preferred choice and the vote will be counted, the Kentucky board said. Mailed absentee ballots come with an instruction sheet that explains that process.
When voting in person, either early or on Election Day, Kentucky voters can choose to spoil their ballot and receive a new, clean ballot, up to two times. If a voter tries to cast a vote where more candidates are selected for an office than allowed, the ballot scanner will flag the ballot as including an overvote and the voter will be allowed to cast a new ballot.

Outside Kentucky, similar systems are in place to notify voters of an overvote and examine voter intent when counting votes. The 2002 Help America Vote Act requires that voting systems notify voters if they select more candidates than allowed and give them a chance to correct their ballots.
Each state has its own process for interpreting voter intent and scanning ballot selections, Amy Cohen, the executive director of the National Association of State Election Directors, told PolitiFact. In many states, if a ballot includes both a small mark and a selection box that’s fully filled in for the same office, the vote would be counted for the fully marked candidate.
Once a mail-in ballot is separated from its envelope, the voter is unknown, making it harder to rectify overvotes of mail-in ballots. Election workers look for discrepancies when they preprocess mail-in ballots, and they ""treat it in accordance with their jurisdiction’s procedures,"" Cohen said. 
If an overvote occurs and it is unclear which candidate the voter intended to select, no vote is counted for that office.

Facebook posts said If a ballot has a small dot in the box for Harris, ""any other box filled in, will be void."" 
Kentucky officials said they had received no reports or complaints of ballots with preprinted marks in the candidate selection fields as of Nov. 4.
The mark shown in the photo does not constitute a vote under state law, Kentucky officials said. If a ballot included a small mark such as that and a selection for another candidate that was clearly filled out, the clearly marked vote would be counted.

The claim ""If a ballot has a small dot in the box for Vice President Kamala Harris, “any other box filled in, will be void.”""  relates to this image because the image shows a ballot *potentially* exhibiting the condition described in the claim.

Let's break down why CLIP gave a ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.32:

* **Presence of a Ballot:** The image clearly depicts a portion of a ballot paper.  This is a fundamental element linking it to the claim, which directly addresses ballot marking procedures.

* **Kamala Harris' Name (Implied):** While the image resolution isn't perfect and doesn't explicitly show ""Kamala Harris,"" the context strongly suggests it's the Vice Presidential section.  Ballot design conventions usually place the Vice President's name clearly adjacent to the corresponding box.  The claim mentions Kamala Harris, further solidifying this association in CLIP's analysis.

* **A Potential ""Small Dot"":** The crucial aspect lies in the interpretation of the markings on the ballot.  The image shows a filled-in oval or a mark that *could* be interpreted as a small dot.  The ambiguity here significantly contributes to the low similarity score (0.32). CLIP doesn't have the contextual understanding to definitively determine whether the mark constitutes a ""small dot"" as defined in the claim.  It's likely the ambiguity of this mark prevents a higher similarity score.

* **Absence of Other Filled Boxes (Partially):** The image only shows a portion of the ballot.  The claim mentions that *other* filled boxes will void the ballot if a ""small dot"" is in Harris' box.  The image doesn't show the complete ballot to confirm the presence or absence of marks in other boxes. This incompleteness is another factor reducing the similarity score.


In summary, CLIP's classification as ""Related"" with a low similarity score (0.32) is justified because:

1. The image shows a relevant object (a ballot section).
2. The image context strongly implies it pertains to the Vice Presidential selection, mirroring the claim.
3. There's an ambiguous mark that *could* be interpreted as the ""small dot"" mentioned in the claim, but not definitively.
4. The image lacks sufficient context to confirm or refute the ""other boxes filled in"" aspect of the claim.


The low similarity score directly reflects the uncertainty and ambiguity in the image, preventing a confident match with the claim's specific condition. A clearer image, showing the complete ballot and definitively demonstrating a ""small dot"" would likely result in a higher similarity score.

The low score reflects the weak connection. Let's break down why:

The image, from Politifact, shows a television screen displaying a news graphic.  However, several crucial elements are missing to directly support the claim:

* **No mention of Texas:** The image doesn't show any geographic location specified. The graphic on the screen might be reporting vote counts from a national level, a specific state *other* than Texas, or even a hypothetical scenario.  There's no textual evidence within the visible portion of the screen to confirm a Texas focus.

* **No comparison between Harris and Trump:** While the screen shows numbers and likely represents vote counts,  there's no visible indication that these numbers are specifically comparing Harris and Trump's vote totals.  The graphic could be comparing Harris to another candidate, or showing her vote count in isolation.

* **No CNN branding fully visible:** While the screen likely depicts CNN, the branding isn't fully and clearly visible in the provided image to confidently confirm the news source.  Partial visibility introduces uncertainty.

* **Low Resolution and Partial View:** The image is of relatively low resolution and only shows a portion of the television screen.  Important contextual information might be cut off, further weakening the connection.


Therefore, the ""Related"" classification stems from the general association: the image depicts a news graphic on a screen that vaguely resembles a possible election result display. However, the critical details necessary to validate the claim are absent. The low similarity score reflects the significant lack of concrete evidence directly supporting the assertion about Harris, Trump, Texas, and CNN in the provided image.  The model correctly identifies a loose thematic connection but flags the weak evidence with a low similarity score.  It’s not a definitive ""match"" but a suggestion of possible relevance based on the limited visible information.

The similarity score of 0.30 between the image and the claim ""Michael Jordan endorsed Donald Trump for president in the 2024 election"" is relatively low, indicating a weak relationship.  This is because, while the image depicts Jordan seemingly endorsing Trump, it's crucial to acknowledge that it's a manipulated image, not genuine evidence of an endorsement.

Here's a breakdown of why CLIP might have assigned a 'Related' classification with a low score:

* **Visual elements suggesting a connection:** The most prominent visual element is Michael Jordan's face, clearly recognizable.  The ""Trump 2024"" hat directly links him to the Trump presidential campaign. This creates a visual association, even if fabricated. This is likely the primary reason for the 'Related' classification.

* **Lack of authenticating elements:**  The image lacks any context suggesting authenticity. There are no credible news sources or official logos present. The unnatural look of the hat on Jordan's head, potential inconsistencies in lighting and shadows, could subconsciously cue the model to a degree of artificiality.  CLIP, while powerful, isn't explicitly trained to detect deepfakes or photo manipulation. It primarily focuses on visual similarity.

* **Low similarity score:** The 0.30 score reflects the model's uncertainty.  While it recognizes the visual link between Jordan and the Trump campaign, it also recognizes the likelihood of manipulation. A higher score would indicate stronger evidence of a genuine endorsement.

* **Contextual understanding limitations:** CLIP lacks the ability to understand the nuanced context of political endorsements.  It doesn't ""know"" that Michael Jordan has not publicly endorsed Donald Trump.  It only compares the visual content of the image to the textual description.

In conclusion, the 'Related' classification with a low score reflects CLIP's ability to identify visual connections between the image and the claim. However, the low score accurately reflects the uncertainty inherent in the image’s authenticity.  The image provides a visual *suggestion* of endorsement but falls short of providing concrete *evidence*.  The low confidence score highlights the limitations of relying solely on visual analysis for verifying claims about real-world events.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.30 to the claim about Cheney accusing Trump of threatening her life and endorsing Kamala Harris is weak but understandable.  The low similarity score indicates a loose connection, not a strong one.

Here's why the connection exists, albeit weakly:

* **Facial Recognition and Person Identification:** The primary reason for the ""Related"" classification is the presence of both Liz Cheney and Kamala Harris in the image.  CLIP excels at identifying people and objects.  Since both individuals are mentioned in the claim, the image's content directly relates to the claim's subjects.

* **Political Contextualization:** CLIP, while not explicitly understanding political context in the way a human does, likely associates the two women as prominent figures in US politics.  The claim itself is a political statement referencing a contentious political environment.  The mere presence of both individuals in an image is enough to create a weak association with a claim about their political activities and allegiances.

* **Lack of Supporting Evidence in the Image:** Crucially, the image *lacks* any visual representation of the claim's core content: Trump's alleged threat or Cheney's endorsement of Harris. The image shows no text, threatening gestures, or any other visual cues directly relating to the specific accusations.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The low similarity score of 0.30 strongly suggests that the relationship is superficial.  The connection is primarily based on the presence of the named individuals, not on any visual evidence supporting the claim's substance.  A higher score would indicate a stronger visual correlation, such as showing a news headline or a visual representation of the alleged threat.

In summary, the image's relevance to the claim is entirely circumstantial. CLIP identifies the people in the image as being relevant to the claim, but doesn't find any visual support for the specific content of the claim itself. The low similarity score reflects this weak, purely subject-based connection.  The classification is more of a ""tangential relationship"" rather than a direct visual confirmation of the claim's validity.

The low similarity score (0.27) from CLIP suggests a weak relationship between the image and the claim about Trump pretending to eat a corn dog on Truth Social.  This is understandable for several reasons:

* **Lack of Visual Connection:** The image contains no corn dogs, microphones, or any visual reference to the act of eating or pretending to eat.  The focus is on Trump's and Cheney's faces and the general setting of a televised broadcast.  There's nothing visually suggestive of the claimed Truth Social post.

* **Contextual Disconnect:** While the image shows Trump, it doesn't depict the context of the Truth Social post.  The post is about a specific event – a claimed microphone usage incident and his explanation – which is absent from the visual information.  The image only shows Trump in a generic televised setting, providing no indication of the specific situation mentioned in the claim.

* **Broad Subject Matter:** The image is related to a broader political context: Trump and Cheney are frequently shown together in news coverage due to their opposing political views. This general association might contribute slightly to the ""Related"" classification, albeit weakly.  The image provides no information about the specifics of any statement made by Trump.

* **CLIP's Limitations:** CLIP, as a multimodal model, excels at associating images with text based on visual and textual features.  However, it struggles with nuanced relationships or events that require understanding complex contextual information.  The connection between the image and the claim is tenuous and lacks direct visual evidence.  The low similarity score reflects this limitation.  It's associating the image with the claim primarily due to the presence of Trump in both, even though the visual information provides no indication about the specifics of the claim.

In summary, the ""Related"" classification is driven by the mere presence of Donald Trump in the image, a weak and indirect connection to the claim about his Truth Social post regarding a corn dog.  The lack of any visual elements directly referencing the core content of the claim explains the low similarity score.  CLIP is associating Trump's image with the text purely on the basis of shared subject—Trump himself— rather than the specific event described.

A Nov. 3 Instagram post shared a video with sticker text that said, ""Coke-beer-wine whatever she loves it,"" and, ""Let’s talk about her drinking problem.""
In the video, Harris tells the crowd, ""You know what, hold, hold on a second. Listen. No, hold on. Hold on. I want to talk about Gaza for a minute. I want to talk about Gaza for a minute. OK?""

In the Instagram video from the Philadelphia rally, Harris is speaking extremely slowly. But news video of the speech makes clear the Instagram video was altered to slow the speed and make her sound drunk.

In the altered Instagram video, Harris speaks for about 20 seconds. In the real video above, also found here, Harris says the same words in 12 seconds.
This claim mirrors numerous social media posts we’ve fact-checked before that falsely claim to show Harris intoxicated at public speeches. It’s been a common line of attack from conservative critics of Harris, who single out memes of Harris that have gone viral, and echoes similar claims made against former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.
One expert PolitiFact spoke to when Pelosi was being targeted said these kinds of false claims aim to advance stereotypes of portraying women as ""unstable"" and ""unfit.""

The visible elements are Harris herself, a microphone, and a partially visible background suggestive of a formal setting.  There's no visible evidence of alcohol consumption – no glasses, bottles, or any indication of intoxication.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.32, while suggesting some connection, indicates a weak relationship between the image and the claim ""Video shows Kamala Harris has a 'drinking problem'"". The low similarity score is crucial here.

The reason for the *weak* ""Related"" classification likely stems from the image's context. CLIP might associate the image with Harris, and because the claim mentions Harris, it establishes a tenuous link.  The image depicts a public appearance, a context where accusations of a drinking problem might be relevant.  The model doesn't understand the semantic meaning of a ""drinking problem"" beyond its association with alcohol consumption; it simply identifies Harris in a public setting, which *could* be relevant to the claim but doesn't offer any supporting or refuting evidence.

In short, the model doesn't see evidence of a drinking problem in the image itself. The relationship is purely contextual and based on the presence of Harris, not visual evidence supporting or contradicting the claim. The low similarity score reflects this lack of visual corroboration.  The classification is a consequence of associative linking rather than a genuine identification of supporting evidence for the claim.

But this is an updated version of a years-old conspiracy theory, and there’s still no evidence to support it.
The Instagram post uses language identical to an Oct. 3 X post by Sean Adl-Tabatabai, co-founder of the website The People’s Voice. The X post had more than 5.5 million views as of Nov. 3.

The same headline and text appeared in an Oct. 3 article from The People’s Voice. PolitiFact has fact-checked multiple fabricated articles published on the site, which frequently publishes false or misleading stories. 
These claims recycle a baseless rumor PolitiFact already debunked: that a secret video exists that shows Clinton assaulting and killing a child in a sacrifice ritual. This conspiracy theory started circulating in 2018 as an outgrowth of the unfounded ""Pizzagate"" conspiracy theory.
There was no credible evidence for it then, and that is still the case. Despite the viral claims, no such video has ever turned up.

Videos show that President Donald Trump admitted to rigging the 2024 election during his preinauguration day rally.
By Loreben Tuquero • January 21, 2025
Federal investigators did reportedly seize video from Combs’ properties. A September 2024 federal indictment alleged that Combs ""kept videos he filmed of victims engaging in sex acts with commercial sex workers.""
The New York Post reported it had viewed dozens of videos seized by federal investigators, purportedly taken at Combs’ parties, which showed him watching or engaging in sex acts between men and women.
However, court documents and reports by credible news outlets about these videos mention neither Clinton nor the killing of a child.
PolitiFact has investigated other false claims about the Combs case involving Vice President Kamala Harris, Beyoncé and Jay-Z and a supposed clone.
We rate the claim that the FBI seized a video of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton killing a child at a Combs party Pants on Fire!",FALSE,image_274.jpg,https://mediaproxy.snopes.com/width/1200/https://media.snopes.com/2023/07/frazzledrip.jpg,Related,0.2692378759384155,"The image from Snopes depicts a screen capture of a debunked internet hoax concerning Hillary Clinton.  The image itself doesn't directly show Hillary Clinton killing a child, nor does it explicitly mention a Sean ""Diddy"" Combs party.  The low similarity score of 0.27 further indicates a weak connection.

The CLIP model's classification as ""Related"" with such a low score is likely due to an indirect association based on several factors:

* **Shared Context:**  The core claim involves a video supposedly depicting Hillary Clinton committing a violent crime. The image is a visual representation of the *specific hoax* surrounding a fabricated video referred to as ""Frazzledrip."" While the image doesn't visually depict the claimed content of the video, it's a visual element *directly associated* with the claim's context.  The image is evidence *against* the claim, showing that the claim's source itself is false, but it's still contextually linked.

* **Keyword association:** The CLIP model might be picking up on keyword associations.  Both the claim and the image relate to ""Hillary Clinton,"" a key element that acts as a bridge for the model, despite the complete absence of visual evidence supporting the claim's specific, horrific content.

* **Negative Correlation:**  The image is demonstrably proof of the *falsity* of the claim.  While this is a negative correlation, the model might still identify a relationship due to the shared subject (Hillary Clinton) and the general topic of the alleged video. The low similarity score reflects the lack of direct visual overlap.

In essence, the relationship is not based on visual similarity of content. Instead, it's a contextual relationship. The image is linked to the claim because it visually represents the debunked origin of the false claim.  The low similarity score reflects the lack of direct visual evidence in the image to support the claim's shocking assertion.  The association is based on the shared subject and the underlying false narrative. The CLIP model is identifying a connection based on the broader context and associated keywords, rather than a visual match.

""Don’t worry about the election, Trump’s not gonna win. I made f-----g sure of that!"" says a Nov. 1 Instagram post. The post attributes the quote to Eric Coomer, identified as Dominion’s director of strategy and security. The post also says Coomer made the statement while ""talking on an antifa conference call.""

This claim is unproven and is the subject of a defamation lawsuit. A judge fined the person who originally made the claim $1,000 a day for failing to produce evidence to corroborate the allegation. That fine is currently on hold pending an appeal.
‘The Dominion guy’
On Nov. 9, 2020, nearly a week after Election Day, Colorado conservative activist Joe Oltmann claimed he had been able to listen in on an ""antifa conference call"" before the election during which a man named Eric from Dominion promised Trump wouldn’t win. Oltmann referred to him as ""the Dominion guy.""
""They're talking on this call and he responds, and I'm paraphrasing this, right. ... ‘Don't worry about the election. Trump is not going to win. I made effing sure of that. Ha ha.’ And everyone's like, ‘Yeah.’ And then somebody else responds ‘effing right,’"" Oltmann said on his podcast, the Conservative Daily.
Trump allies and pro-Trump cable news networks such as One America News and Newsmax  amplified Oltmann’s claim.
PolitiFact has found no credible evidence that Dominion’s machines affected any vote tallies, and our reporting found Dominion Voting Systems was used only in a few counties that experienced minor problems which were quickly resolved. Those problems were the result of either human error or temporary malfunctions. Republicans and Democrats who run elections also say there was no vote-rigging using Dominion systems.
Dominion Voting Systems was the subject of many debunked claims during and after the 2020 election. The company won a $787 million settlement against Fox News for repeatedly airing the false claims.
Coomer’s past anti-Trump statements
Coomer, who was Dominion’s director of product strategy and security during the 2020 election, did post anti-Trump comments on his Facebook page in 2016. Oltmann found the comments and aired them on his podcast.
""I don’t give a damn if you're friend, family or random acquaintance,"" Coomer wrote in one post. ""(If you) pull the lever, mark an oval, touch the screen for that carnival barker ... UNFRIEND ME NOW.""
Coomer told The New York Times in 2021 that the Facebook posts were authentic. But he said he never participated in an antifa conference call and never said the things Oltmann claimed he did.

""I did not participate in a scheme to rig votes,"" Coomer said in a court sworn statement. ""I did not participate in an Antifa conference call or boast about my supposed ability to rig the election. Such conduct is antithetical to my belief system and would constitute criminal conduct.""
Oltmann never offered evidence
Coomer filed a defamation lawsuit against OItmann and others who amplified the claim.
Oltmann has yet to provide evidence about the ""antifa conference call"" or how he gained access to the meeting. He has never provided details about the person who gave him access to Coomer’s private Facebook account, USA Today reported in September.
Oltmann also has yet to provide any evidence corroborating that Coomer said the things Oltmann has claimed.
A judge in the defamation case ruled in September 2024 that Oltmann owes Coomer $1,000 a day for as long as he continues to withhold evidence of his claims of election rigging, Colorado Politics reported. In October, the court agreed to put the fines on hold pending an appeal.
Newsmax also has retracted its claims about Coomer.
""Newsmax has found no evidence that Dr. Coomer interfered with Dominion voting machines or voting software in any way, nor that Dr. Coomer ever claimed to have done so,"" a 2021 Newsmax statement said. ""Nor has Newsmax found any evidence that Dr. Coomer ever participated in any conversation with members of 'antifa,' nor that he was directly involved with any partisan political organization.""

The image shows a mostly empty, dimly lit room with some indistinct furniture and what appears to be a partially visible person in the background.  There is no text visible, no recognizable individuals, and nothing that suggests an Antifa meeting, a Dominion Voting System employee, or anything related to the 2020 election results.

The low similarity score (0.25) reflects this lack of overlap between the image's content and the claim's subject matter. CLIP works by associating image features with textual concepts.  Since the image lacks any features commonly associated with political rallies, election fraud accusations, or even the individuals named in the claim, the model correctly identifies a weak or nonexistent relationship.  The image is essentially generic and visually uninformative concerning the claim.  It's a picture that could be taken in countless different contexts, none of which are connected to the specific events described in the claim.  Therefore, the ""Unrelated"" classification and low similarity score are justified.
