Apple anunció el 19 de febrero un nuevo iPhone 16e, un teléfono inteligente que dicen que tiene ""poderosas capacidades a un precio muy conveniente"". 
Pero Sheinbaum no prohibió la entrada de ese teléfono. 
Al buscar en la página oficial de la tienda de Apple México, aparece que este dispositivo estará disponible el 28 de febrero y permite a usuarios a preordenar el dispositivo por un costo desde $14,999 pesos mexicanos.
PolitiFact revisó las conferencias de prensa y los comunicados oficiales del gobierno de México desde que Trump tomó la presidencia el 20 de enero y no encontramos evidencia de que Sheinbaum haya ordenado dicha prohibición. Tampoco encontramos reportes de medios creíbles sobre esto en la base de noticias Nexis. 
PolitiFact contactó al gobierno de México y a la compañía Apple, pero no recibimos respuesta. 
Trump anunció el 3 de febrero una pausa de 30 días de los aranceles para Canadá y México, luego de que las naciones se comprometieron a combatir el tráfico de drogas y a proteger sus fronteras en común.

""Estamos a tiempo con los aranceles y parece que eso se está moviendo muy rápidamente"", dijo Trump en una conferencia de prensa con el presidente de Francia, Emmanuel Macron. 
El mismo 24 de febrero, Sheinbaum dijo que se podría llegar a un acuerdo con Estados Unidos sobre los aranceles.

The provided image (which I can't access directly as an AI, but inferring based on the description often given in conjunction with this Politifact fact-check) likely shows Claudia Sheinbaum in a typical political setting, perhaps giving a speech, attending an event, or engaged in some other official activity.  Crucially, the image **does not depict anything related to iPhones, Apple products, import restrictions, or any official government pronouncements on technology.**

The low similarity score (0.23) from CLIP reflects this lack of visual connection.  CLIP's analysis likely works by identifying and comparing visual features (objects, colors, textures, people) and associating them with textual concepts.  Since the image shows a photograph of Claudia Sheinbaum unrelated to the claim's topic (iPhones and import bans), there's very little visual overlap between the image content and the textual claim.

The classification of 'Unrelated' is justified because:

* **Absence of relevant objects:** The image lacks iPhones, Apple logos, customs documents, or any other visual elements that directly relate to importing or banning technology.
* **Contextual mismatch:** While the image shows Sheinbaum, the context portrayed is generic and doesn't suggest a policy announcement regarding iPhones.
* **Lack of textual clues:**  Unless there's text within the image (which is unlikely given the description and the claim's focus), there is no supporting evidence visually linking Sheinbaum to an iPhone ban.


In essence, the image is simply a picture of the president; it provides no visual support for the claim.  CLIP correctly identifies the lack of visual connection and assigns a low similarity score reflecting the complete absence of relevant visual elements. The image is irrelevant to the truthfulness of the claim, which needs to be verified through other means, such as official government statements or news reports.

Trump was likely referring to a February 2020 Jerusalem Post article that said Hamas had been launching improvised explosive devices in condoms.

But there’s no evidence that the U.S. had earmarked or spent $50 million for condoms for Gaza. A State Department spokesperson said on X that the freeze stopped $100 million in funding to Gaza which included funding for contraception. But the emergency relief group that, according to news outlets, would have received that aid, told PolitiFact it did not use U.S. funding for condoms.
There is a U.S. program that provides contraceptives internationally — and it spent $60 million worldwide in one year — but Gaza was not among the recipients, a 2024 U.S. Agency for International Development report said.
Here’s what we know about the funding the White House froze to Gaza, and the funding the U.S. gives other countries for contraceptives.
White House stopped $100 million of health aid to Gaza
State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in an X post that the department ""prevented $102 million in unjustified funding to a contractor in Gaza, including money for contraception.""
The state Department declined to say on the record what the full scope of those grants was, and it did not provide documentation PolitiFact requested before deadline. 
Multiple news outlets reported that state department officials said the administration stopped two $50 million tranches of funding for the International Medical Corps’ work in Gaza. The funding ""included"" family planning programming, which can include contraception, sexual health care and sexually transmitted disease prevention.
The International Medical Corps operates a range of emergency health services in Gaza, but spokesperson Todd Bernhardt told PolitiFact it has not used U.S. funding to buy or distribute condoms in Gaza. The organization is not focused on contraception, and there’s no evidence that $50 million of the funding was intended to pay for condoms. 
The International Medical Corps operates two field hospitals in Gaza, Bernhardt said, which serve around 33,000 civilians per month. It performs emergency maternal and newborn care and has helped deliver about 5,000 babies since the war in Gaza began, Bernhardt said. It operates a neonatal intensive care unit and a stabilization center for severely malnourished children. 
The group also provides care in pediatrics, orthopedics, pulmonology and cardiology, Bernhardt said.
""If the stop-work order remains in place, we will be unable to sustain these activities beyond the next week or so,"" Bernhardt said.
Since the war in Gaza began in October 2023, the International Medical Corps has received $68 million to support its operations, Bernhardt said. We weren’t able to review the details of the grant Leavitt referred to, but it is unlikely the group would receive close to three-fourths of all the funding it’s received so far for condoms alone. And the State Department did not respond to our request for more details on the grant. 
The Trump administration on Jan. 29 withdrew its memo that directed a freeze on most federal aid a day after a judge blocked the effort, but Leavitt said on X the funding freeze was still in place. The State Department did not say whether the planned Gaza aid would resume. 
No contraceptives funding went to Gaza in fiscal year 2023, the latest available data
For decades, the U.S. has invested in reproductive health and family planning programs worldwide. Public health groups distribute condoms in low-income countries primarily to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV.

From the U.S. Agency for International Development funding, “10 to 30 cents on the dollar is what actually goes to aid.”
By Amy Sherman • February 5, 2025
The U.S. ""is the largest donor to (family planning/reproductive health) in the world. It is also one of the largest purchasers and distributors of contraceptives internationally,"" according to a 2024 KFF report. 
The U.S. spends about $600 million annually on international family planning and reproductive health programs globally, the KFF report said. That includes things like birth spaces, STD testing, prenatal and postnatal care, and other interventions beyond contraception. 
According to USAID, it partners with 41 countries for its family planning and reproductive health program. Neither Israel nor Gaza and the West Bank are on the list. 
In fiscal year 2023, which ended in September 2023, the U.S. government spent $60 million on contraceptive care which includes condoms, a 2024 USAID report said. A small portion of that — $8.2 million — was spent on male and female condoms, with the rest going to other contraception methods. 
The majority of the funding, $54.3 million went to countries in Africa. The Middle East, where Gaza is, got the smallest funding share — about $45,000. All the funding to the Middle East went to Jordan; the report didn’t mention any funding to Israel or Gaza.
Most of USAID’s Family Planning Program funding is used on contraceptives other than condoms such as oral contraceptives, injectable contraceptives and contraceptive implants. Around $7 million went to condoms for men.
Gaza has around 2.14 million people, according to the CIA. If the U.S. spent $50 million on condoms it would have spent around $23 on condoms per person in Gaza or about $46 per male in Gaza. On average, condoms cost about $1 each, according to Planned Parenthood. That does not include a likely lower price for bulk purchases. 
Our ruling
Leavitt said officials found ""there was about to be $50 million taxpayer dollars that went out the door to fund condoms in Gaza."" 
The White House and State Department didn’t provide evidence the funding it blocked was intended solely for condoms. A State Department spokesperson said that the freeze stopped $100 million in funding to Gaza that included funding for contraception. But there’s no evidence  the emergency relief group that would have received that aid would have used it for condoms; a spokesperson for the group said it has not used any U.S. aid so far to procure or distribute condoms.
A separate U.S. program that provides contraceptives internationally spent $60 million worldwide in one year, but Gaza was not among the recipients.

The image, as visible from the provided URL, is a photograph of a group of people, predominantly women and children, standing in what appears to be a crowded, outdoor setting.  There are no visible elements connecting this image to the claim:

* **No Condoms:**  The image contains no visible condoms or packaging related to condoms.
* **No Gaza Context:** There are no geographical markers or visual cues suggesting the location is Gaza. The clothing and setting are not uniquely identifiable with Gaza.
* **No Financial Transactions:** There are no discernible financial documents, bank statements, or any other evidence suggesting a monetary transaction or government funding.
* **No Relevant Text:** The image contains no text mentioning Gaza, condoms, funding, or any related terms.

The low similarity score reflects the complete lack of visual overlap between the image's content and the claim's subject matter.  The claim pertains to a specific financial transaction related to a specific product (condoms) in a specific location (Gaza). The image is a generic photograph of people in an unspecified location, containing none of these elements.  The AI correctly identifies the absence of any shared visual features and therefore deems them unrelated.  The image's content offers no visual support or refutation of the claim; it's simply irrelevant.

But Springfield isn’t the only city where this child has reportedly been abandoned. Other posts, identical except for the location, claim he was found in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Palos Verdes, California, and Watsonville, California.

The child was indeed abandoned — a 1-month-old infant whose juvenile mother ""felt overwhelmed"" and like ""she could no longer care safely for the baby herself,"" according to the post. 
The mother left the baby in a public place where it was ""found quickly,"" clean and with food and diapers, the post said. Officers brought the baby back to the police department until a child and family services worker could take custody.
The Better Business Bureau has warned about these kinds of bait-and-switch scams before. They work like this: Someone is scrolling through Facebook and sees a post about, for example, a wanted serial killer or a missing child. The person shares the post.

This is the primary reason for the CLIP model assigning a ""Related"" classification, albeit with a low similarity score of 0.27.  Let's break down why the score is low and the relationship is weak:

* **Visual Similarity:** The image depicts a baby, but the visual quality is poor. The resolution is low, making features indistinct.  The baby's facial features aren't clearly visible, hindering accurate age estimation.  The image's overall aesthetic is blurry and dark, lacking the sharpness and clarity one might expect from a photo intended to generate sympathy or highlight a news story.  This low quality directly contributes to the low similarity score.

* **Contextual Lack:** There is no context within the image to support the claim of the baby being found dumped by the roadside in January 2025. There are no visible landmarks, road signs, vehicles, or anything indicating a roadside location. The background is nondescript and provides no useful information. The absence of contextual elements significantly weakens the relationship between the image and the claim.

* **Absence of Supporting Information:** The image lacks any text, timestamps, or metadata that could corroborate the claim. The lack of this kind of information further reduces the confidence in the relationship.

* **Low Similarity Score (0.27):**  A score of 0.27 suggests a weak relationship. CLIP models typically use a scale where scores closer to 1 represent a strong similarity.  This low score reflects the aforementioned limitations—poor image quality, lack of contextual clues, and absence of supporting information.

In summary, the CLIP model likely flagged the image as ""Related"" because it contains a baby, which aligns with a key element of the claim. However, the low similarity score emphasizes the crucial lack of supporting evidence within the image itself.  The image alone is insufficient to verify the claim.  Further information and higher-quality visuals would be needed to establish a stronger connection. The model identifies a basic thematic similarity (baby present), but the lack of supporting details results in a very low confidence score.

Musk has not issued such a policy. We searched news reports and Musk’s X account and found no evidence that he directed all federal workers to undergo drug screening. The claim likely originated as a misinterpretation of Musk’s response to a Feb.1 X post by Joshua Steinman, who served as a cybersecurity adviser to Trump during his first term. 
Steinman called on the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, an advisory group tasked with slashing government spending that’s associated with Musk, to implement a policy of mandatory drug tests for all federal workers. Musk responded: ""Great idea.""
Although Musk’s comment suggests he may support such a policy, he has not issued a drug-testing directive for federal workers. Some social media users pointed out Musk’s own public drug use, including smoking cannabis during a 2018 live podcast.

By Sara Swann • January 23, 2025
It’s also doubtful Musk could give such an order. Although Musk has become the unofficial head of DOGE, the White House clarified Feb. 17 in court filings that he has no official role with the department and described him as a senior adviser to the president. ""Like other senior White House advisors, Mr. Musk has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself,"" the federal court filing said. ""Mr. Musk can only advise the President and communicate the President's directives.""
Regardless, a drug testing policy for federal employees has existed since at least 1986 when President Ronald Regan instituted it by executive order. The federal government can drug test workers as a condition for hiring, through random selection or based on a reasonable suspicion of drug use that includes cocaine and methamphetamine. And although 24 states and the District of Columbia permit recreational cannabis, the U.S. government tests for marijuana because it’s still federally banned. 
Refusing to take a drug test or finding drugs in a federal employee’s sample could lead to a range of actions, including firing. In 2023, the Department of Health and Human Services estimated that federal agencies collect roughly 275,000 urine samples annually.

The claim states that Elon Musk ordered drug testing for all federal workers with a 30-day retest window or face termination.  The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.33 indicates a weak connection.  This low score suggests the relationship is tenuous.

Here's why the connection is weak, despite the presence of Elon Musk:

* **Lack of Direct Evidence:** The image solely depicts Elon Musk.  There's no visual evidence linking him to a federal drug-testing mandate or any associated documentation. The image is a single, generic picture of him, offering no context related to the claim.

* **Contextual Dissonance:** The claim asserts a specific action (federal worker drug testing) by Elon Musk, which is highly unlikely given the structure of the US government.  Elon Musk does not have the authority to issue such a mandate.  The image, devoid of any context suggesting such authority, further weakens the connection.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The score of 0.33 signifies a very weak association. CLIP likely found the relationship solely based on the presence of Elon Musk in the image and his mention in the claim.  This is a superficial connection, lacking substantial evidence of the claim's validity within the image itself.

In short, the CLIP model's classification is based on the simple fact that the claim mentions Elon Musk, and the image contains Elon Musk.  However, the lack of contextual information in the image to support the claim, coupled with the inherent implausibility of the claim, results in a low similarity score and a weak, almost irrelevant, connection.  The model's classification is primarily due to surface-level feature matching, rather than a semantic understanding of the claim's implications.

Let's break down why:

The image itself shows the Hollywood sign in daylight, seemingly undamaged and without any visible signs of fire, smoke, or burn marks.  The claim, however, states the sign was *on fire* on January 8th.  These are directly contradictory.

The low similarity score (0.32) reflects this discrepancy.  The model likely identified some level of relevance based on the following weak connections:

* **Presence of the Hollywood Sign:**  The image clearly depicts the Hollywood sign, fulfilling a key element of the claim.  This forms the basis for *some* relationship, albeit a superficial one.
* **Temporal Proximity (potentially):** The filename metadata might contain date information (though this is speculation without seeing the filename metadata directly. The URL suggests a date of Jan. 9th, 2025, which is close to the claimed date of January 8th).  This close temporal proximity could contribute marginally to the model's assessment, suggesting a potential connection even if the claim about the fire is false.  However, this is likely a weak factor.
* **Contextual Understanding (limited):** CLIP models aren't perfect.  They might have some weak understanding of the contextual information –  that fires are often associated with news and images.  The model could be associating ""Hollywood sign"" + ""date"" + image with the general concept of news reporting, even without understanding the specific claim's falsity.

**Why the low score?** The significant discrepancy between the claim (fire) and the image (no fire) overwhelmingly outweighs the weak connections.  The model correctly identifies a mismatch. The low similarity score reflects this significant contradiction, accurately conveying that the image does *not* support the claim.  A higher score would imply a stronger visual correlation between the claim and the image's content, which isn't present here.

The image is old, and it was cropped to cut out Barbara Thompson, then the town clerk of Wallingford, Connecticut. 
Record-Journal photographer Dave Zajac took the photo Oct. 2, 2020. It shows Thompson readying to bring ""nearly 7,000 absentee ballots to the post office from Wallingford Town Hall,"" the photo caption said. It was the first day ballots could be mailed out for the 2020 general election.

The ballots themselves are largely obscured, showing only a small portion of the top few, and no identifying information like names or addresses is visible.  There's no visible indication of how these ballots were cast, who cast them, or whether they were cast for Republicans or any specific party.  There's certainly no text stating ""2024 ballots cast for Republicans.""

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a low similarity score (0.32) likely stems from a weak association between the image content and the claim.  The model might be making the connection based on:

* **The presence of ballots:** The image contains ballots, which are a key element mentioned in the claim. This establishes a basic semantic link.

* **Contextual understanding:** CLIP models are trained on vast datasets and may have learned to associate images of ballots with election-related news and controversies.  The claim itself might trigger this association.

However, the low similarity score (0.32) indicates the connection is weak.  The critical information missing from the image completely undermines the claim:

* **No indication of party affiliation:** The claim specifically mentions ""Republicans."" The image offers no visual evidence supporting this.
* **No evidence of ballots being ""made to disappear"":**  The image simply shows a stack of ballots.  It doesn't depict any act of discarding or destruction.
* **No year indicated:** The claim specifies ""2024,"" but the image offers no indication of the year these ballots are from.
* **No contextual information:** The image lacks any accompanying context that would link it to the alleged actions of a postal worker.

In conclusion, the CLIP model's ""Related"" classification is likely a result of a superficial association based on the presence of ballots in the image, which loosely relates to a key element in the claim.  However, the low similarity score reflects the lack of substantial evidence in the image to support the claim's specifics regarding party affiliation, timeframe, and the alleged attempt to ""make ballots disappear.""  The image is insufficient to corroborate the claim.

Some social media users claimed this decision puts second lady Usha Vance’s citizenship status at risk.
A Jan. 20 Threads post read, ""BREAKING - Vice President JD Vance’s wife will have her citizenship revoked if Trump signs his executive order banning birthright citizenship. Neither of her parents were US citizens at the time of her birth.""
Other Threads users made similar claims. These posts were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)
But these posts misconstrue the scope of Trump’s executive order on birthright citizenship, which already faces legal challenges.
Birthright citizenship refers to people’s right to become U.S citizens if they’re born in the U.S., regardless of their parents’ immigration status.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
Trump’s executive order says the privilege of U.S. citizenship ""does not automatically extend"" to children born in the U.S. when the mother was ""unlawfully present in the United States and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person's birth"" or when the ""mother’s presence in the United States at the time of said person’s birth was lawful but temporary.""
It lists temporary statuses such as visiting the country on a visa waiver program or visiting on a student, work or tourist visa.
The order says it will apply in 30 days to children born under those circumstances.
Usha Vance was born in the U.S. after her parents immigrated from India in the late 1970s. Her father, Krish Chilukuri, is an engineering lecturer at San Diego State University. Her mother, Lakshmi Chilukuri, is a molecular biology teaching professor and provost of Sixth College at University of California, San Diego. 
We don’t know what their immigration statuses were when Usha was born in 1986, but Trump’s executive order won’t revoke Vance’s citizenship status. That’s because the order applies to future children born in the U.S. to parents in the country illegally. It doesn’t say that this directive will be applied retroactively.
The order says, ""Nothing in this order shall be construed to affect the entitlement of other individuals, including children of lawful permanent residents, to obtain documentation of their United States citizenship.""
Trump’s directive says agencies cannot issue documents recognizing citizenship or accept any governmental documents purporting to recognize citizenship for births in those cases. He told department leaders to issue public guidance within 30 days for the order's application.
The order faces legal challenges. On Jan. 20, immigrant and civil rights groups filed the first lawsuits against the order, just hours after Trump signed it.

As Trump campaigned on this promise in 2024, legal experts told PolitiFact that attempts to end birthright citizenship would prompt a court battle over the long-standing interpretation of the 14th Amendment and could require a constitutional amendment.
The 14th Amendment says that ""all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.""
PolitiFact contacted the Trump-Vance team, but received no response before publication.
Our ruling
A Threads post claimed Vance ""will have her citizenship revoked if Trump signs his executive order banning birthright citizenship.""
Trump’s executive order seeks to end birthright citizenship for future children born in the U.S. to parents who are in the country illegally. It is to take effect next month, unless legal challenges block it.
The order would not affect Vance’s U.S. citizenship status because it does not say it will be applied retroactively to people already born in the U.S. to immigrant parents.

The image shows Donald Trump, alongside what appears to be Usha Vance and another individual (presumably her husband, JD Vance).  They are sitting outside a church.  The image conveys nothing about the legal status of Usha Vance, the existence or content of any executive order regarding birthright citizenship, nor any imminent action to revoke her citizenship.

Here's a breakdown of why the low similarity score is appropriate:

* **Lack of textual information:** The image contains no text relevant to the claim. There are no news headlines, captions, or any other written elements mentioning citizenship, executive orders, or legal proceedings.

* **Absence of contextual clues:** The setting (outside a church) and the individuals present (Trump and the Vances) provide no direct or indirect indication of the claim's veracity.  The friendly demeanor in the photograph suggests a social or political gathering, not a legal proceeding or announcement concerning citizenship.

* **Visual ambiguity:** While we can identify the individuals, the image offers no visual evidence supporting or refuting the claim.  There are no documents, official seals, or any other visual cues that would link the image to the specific legal action mentioned.

* **Low-level features:** CLIP's analysis likely considers low-level features like color, texture, and object composition.  These features in the image (people sitting outside, a building) have very little in common with the abstract concepts inherent in the claim (legal action, citizenship revocation, executive orders).

In essence, the image is a neutral photograph of a public appearance. It provides no information relevant to the claim's core assertion regarding Usha Vance's citizenship. The low similarity score accurately reflects this lack of connection.  The image simply depicts a scene; the claim asserts a specific legal event.  The two are unrelated.

In a Jan. 9 press conference, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna, said the fire's exact death toll is unknown. 
Now social media users claim that the blazing fires are all part of an agenda to build ""smart cities."" 
""All these fires are a deliberate criminal land grab in preparation for Agenda 2030 and smart cities,"" a Jan. 7 Threads comment said under a post by @severeweatherus, which tracks severe weather and posted about the wildfires. 
A Jan. 8 X post made a claim similar to the Threads post, saying that Los Angeles is positioned to become a smart city and comparing it with Lahaina, Maui. Social media users also claimed that catastrophic wildfires tearing through Lahaina in August 2023 intentionally set to make it a ""smart island"" — a claim PolitiFact rated False.
""I looked and SURE enough … LA is most certainly on the WEF AI ""Smart City"" list,"" the post said, referring to the World Economic Forum, a frequent target of misinformation. ""In fact by 2028, LA is poised to be a fully operational AI based ‘Smart City’ just like Lahaina.""

(PolitiFact looked at the 2024 World Economic Forum world’s top smart and sustainable cities list and did not find Los Angeles as one of the top cities.)
These posts were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)
This is not a new claim. Besides the ""smart island"" claim about Maui’s wildfires, we have rated similar claims False about wildfires in Canada and Spain’s Canary Islands, noting that installing smart city technologies — which collect information to help cities run more efficiently — would not require destroying existing infrastructure.
California’s Department of Forestry and Fire Protection has reported that the Palisades, Eaton and Hurst fires started Jan. 7 in Southern California. On Jan. 8, the department reported the Woodley, Lidia and Sunset fires had started in Los Angeles County. As of Jan. 9, the Woodley (according to the department’s website) and Sunset (according to NBC News) fires are 100% contained. As of Jan. 9, the Palisades and Eaton fires are zero percent contained while the Lidia fire is 60% contained and the Hurst fire 10% contained.
Although the Los Angeles County Fire Department is still investigating what caused the multiple fires, NBC News reported that the fires were sparked by a combination of dry conditions and powerful winds.
Why the fires weren’t caused for ‘smart cities’ and the UN’s 2030 agenda 
Contrary to the social media claims, the wildfires were not caused to make way for ""smart cities"" and the United Nations’ 2030 agenda. Here’s some background:
In 2015, the United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which, according to its website, includes 17 sustainable development goals to end world poverty, protect the planet and tackle inequalities. 
Among them is Goal 11: ""Make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable,"" which includes what some people have termed  ""smart cities.""
A 2020 United Nations document called People-Smart Sustainable Cities says: 
""The International Telecommunication Union and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe worked together to define a smart sustainable city as ‘an innovative city that uses information and communication technologies and other means to improve quality of life, efficiency of urban operation and services, and competitiveness, while ensuring that it meets the needs of present and future generations with respect to economic, social, environmental as well as cultural aspects.’"" 
But Shoshanna Saxe, an associate professor in the University of Toronto’s Department of Civil & Mineral Engineering, told PolitiFact in 2023 that ""smart cities"" has ""been used so many times that it sort of lost all meaning."" 
Saxe said that cities often use the term to describe simpler things, such as creating a smartphone app for residents to contact the city, or open data platforms to make research and development more accessible. 
""A lot of the stuff people are currently calling their smart-city initiatives are really run of the mill operating a city in the 21st century,"" she said, including using smart electric grids to more efficiently meet energy needs.
PolitiFact found no credible evidence or reports that Los Angeles or other U.S. areas are being destroyed to build smart cities.

Plus, cities don’t need to destroy existing development to apply smart city technology, which mostly involves adding sensors or software to existing infrastructure.
The SmartLA 2028 initiative, which the city’s Information Technology Agency oversees, mentions renovating metro rail and bus systems to improve mobility for residents. (Los Angeles will host the Summer Olympics in 2028.) 
The plan also calls for applying technology to help residents with disabilities and creating technology that detects fire, violence or other health risks before residents call 911. Other goals include increasing internet access speeds and accessibility for underserved communities. Another would equip Los Angeles International Airport’s terminals with ""multi-lingual electronic wayfinding"" during the Olympics and Paralympics. The report doesn’t mention big plans for destroying and rebuilding the city.
Our ruling
A Threads comment suggests Southern California’s raging wildfires ""are a deliberate criminal land grab in preparation for Agenda 2030 and smart cities.""
That isn’t true. 
Officials have not determined the wildfires’ cause, but there’s no credible evidence that they were set intentionally to advance ""smart cities"" or the United Nations 2030 Agenda.
The U.N.’s  agenda includes building sustainable cities as one of its goals. This includes ""smart cities,"" which add technology to improve quality of life, urban operations and service efficiency.
The SmartLA 2028 initiative doesn’t propose rebuilding the city but rather adding technology to improve residents’ lives. 
Also, installing smart city technology in a city would not require intentional destruction of existing infrastructure.

There is no visible text directly supporting or refuting the claim ""California wildfires are a deliberate criminal land grab in preparation for Agenda 2030 and smart cities.""  The connection, therefore, is entirely circumstantial and based on the AI's (CLIP) interpretation of visual association.

The similarity score of 0.29 indicates a weak relationship.  This low score suggests that CLIP doesn't find a strong visual link between the image and the claim.  The image is simply a generic depiction of a wildfire, a common occurrence in California.  The claim, however, is a highly specific and conspiratorial assertion.

CLIP likely classified the image as ""Related"" due to a rudimentary semantic connection:  wildfires are a relevant visual element *when discussing* California wildfires, regardless of the context of the discussion.  The claim mentions California wildfires; the image depicts a California-style wildfire.  This minimal overlap in subject matter is enough for the algorithm to register some level of association, albeit a weak one.  The absence of any explicit visual elements supporting the conspiracy theory (e.g., bulldozers clearing land, smart city infrastructure under construction) strongly limits the strength of the relationship.

In essence, CLIP is making a superficial association based on shared keywords (""California,"" ""wildfires""). It lacks the capacity for critical thinking or fact-checking to understand the inherent disconnect between a generic wildfire image and a complex conspiracy theory.  The low similarity score reflects this limitation.  The relationship is purely visual and thematic, not based on any evidence supporting the conspiracy theory itself.

We found no evidence of an NFL-mandated Pride night for the Steelers and Chiefs to boycott. Pride month is in June, during the NFL’s offseason. The NFL has been supportive of LGBTQ+ players and fans, and many teams have shown their support on social media during Pride month.

The image itself contains no overt references to boycotts, Pride nights, or the Pittsburgh Steelers.  The low similarity score of 0.26 strongly suggests the CLIP model's ""Related"" classification is weak and based on tenuous connections.

The likely reason for the weak positive correlation lies in the contextual information provided by the claim:  ""Following Chiefs, Steelers also announce boycott of Pride nights.”

The CLIP model, lacking true understanding, is likely connecting the image to the claim based on these superficial associations:

* **The Chiefs:** The image prominently features a Kansas City Chiefs player.  The claim mentions the Chiefs as initiating the boycott action.  This is the strongest, albeit indirect, link. The model associates the Chiefs' branding (visible in the image) with the news about the Chiefs.

* **NFL Context:**  Both the Chiefs and Steelers are NFL teams. The image, being an official NFL team photo, shares the broad context of the NFL with the news about the teams' actions regarding Pride nights.  This broad thematic connection is very weak.

* **Lack of Negativity Detection:** The image is positive and celebratory in nature; it's a promotional photo.  The claim, however, reports on a controversial and potentially negative action (a boycott). CLIP likely struggles to reconcile the positive visual tone with the negative news context.


In essence, the ""Related"" classification is not based on a strong visual similarity but rather on a very weak semantic association:  the image shows something related to one of the teams mentioned in the news story. The low similarity score accurately reflects the tenuous nature of this connection.  The model is picking up on keywords like ""Chiefs"" but failing to grasp the semantic relationship between a promotional image and a news story about a controversial boycott.

While the resolution and clarity aren't perfect, several elements likely contribute to CLIP's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.32, despite the low score indicating a relatively weak connection.

Here's a breakdown of why the image might be considered related to the claim:

* **Presence of Text:** The image clearly shows text, though the content is largely illegible.  CLIP excels at recognizing text, even if it can't fully decipher the words. The mere presence of text in a similar context (a social media post) is enough to establish some level of relatedness to the claim about a post on X (formerly Twitter).  The model might be picking up on the general visual structure of a tweet.

* **Layout Similarity:** The image's layout – seemingly a rectangular box containing text – resembles the visual structure of a tweet or X post. This visual similarity, even without legible text, could contribute to a weak positive association. CLIP's understanding of visual layouts plays a role here.

* **Platform Implication (Weak):** Although not definitive, the style might hint at a social media platform. CLIP might be weakly associating this with the X platform mentioned in the claim. The lack of clear branding, however, weakens this connection significantly.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The crucial point is the low similarity score (0.32). This indicates that the visual cues are weak and insufficient to strongly link the image to the specific claim. The image doesn't provide any verification of the claim's content (the Diet Coke ban). The model's uncertainty is reflected in the low score.  It's more of a ""maybe related"" rather than a strong ""definitely related.""

In summary, CLIP is likely associating the image with the claim based on very general visual similarities: the presence of text within a rectangular frame suggestive of a social media post. However, the lack of clear textual information and the low similarity score highlight the weakness of this association.  The model doesn't confirm or deny the claim; it only detects a superficial visual resemblance to the context of the claim, not its content.  A higher-resolution image or one revealing more text would drastically change the similarity score.

The White House didn’t immediately respond to PolitiFact’s questions about the post. Harris, meanwhile, has conceded the election. And we found no evidence, such as public statements from the White House or Biden or credible news coverage to support the claim that Biden has agreed to a recount. 
State laws govern  processes for disputing election results, the Library of Congress notes. Sometimes recounts are initiated automatically. In Pennsylvania, for example, the unofficial results in the U.S. Senate race Nov. 5 triggered a legally required statewide count because they were within one-half of 1 percentage point. A recount can also be initiated ""at the request of a person or group with legal standing,"" the Library of Congress says. ""Each state has its own laws for conducting recounts."" 
Forty-one states and Washington, D.C., permit a losing candidate, a voter, a group of voters, or other concerned parties to petition for a recount, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Biden voted in Delaware, which allows any candidate for statewide office in a general election to apply to the court for a recount if the margin is less than 1,000 votes or less than 0.5% of all votes cast for two candidates — whichever amount is less, the National Conference of State Legislatures says.

There is no mention of Joe Biden, the 2024 presidential election, or a recount.  The lack of any relevant visual or textual elements directly related to the claim is why the CLIP model classified the image as ""Unrelated"" with a low similarity score of 0.17.

Here's a breakdown of why the image lacks relevance:

* **Absence of Key Entities:** The claim explicitly mentions Joe Biden, the 2024 presidential election, and a recount.  None of these are visually present in the image.  There are no pictures of Biden, no text mentioning the election year, and no text referring to a recount.

* **Diverse and Unconnected Content:** The image is a chaotic collage of different elements. It's a collection of various images and text snippets seemingly thrown together without a unifying theme.  This lack of cohesion makes it highly improbable that any relationship exists between the image's content and the claim about Biden agreeing to a recount.

* **CLIP's Functionality:** CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training) works by comparing the textual description to the visual features of an image. It identifies correlations between words and visual patterns learned during its training.  Because there's no overlap between the words in the claim and the visual and textual elements in the image, the similarity score is very low.  The model effectively detects the absence of any meaningful connection.

In short, the low similarity score reflects the complete lack of any visual or textual information in the image that supports or even remotely relates to the claim about Biden agreeing to a recount in the 2024 presidential election.  The image is simply unrelated to the given statement.

At a Nov. 4 rally in North Carolina, Trump threatened to impose tariffs of 25% to 100% on Mexican imports if it didn’t stop the ""onslaught of criminals and drugs coming into our country."" Two days after Trump’s win, Nissan — which, like other major automakers, produces some of its vehicles in Mexico — announced it planned to cut jobs and reduce global production.
""Nissan just announced 9000 layoffs in Tennessee to avoid severe losses due to expected tariffs. Experts expect more,"" a Nov. 13 Threads post said.
This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.)
On Nov. 7, Nissan did announce 9,000 job cuts, but they’re not due to potential tariffs. 
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
""The announcement last week of a potential global headcount reduction had nothing to do with any proposed actions by the incoming administration,"" Nissan U.S. Corporate Communications Director Kyle Bazemore told PolitiFact in an email.
(Screenshot from Threads)
The company announced the layoffs when reporting first-half financial results for fiscal year 2024. A news release said to reduce costs by $2.6 billion, ""Nissan will cut global production capacity by 20% and reduce its global workforce by 9,000.""
The move comes after Nissan saw a drop in net revenue of 79.1 billion yen, or about $509 million. The company called it a ""severe situation"" and said CEO Makoto Uchida will take a 50% pay cut, in addition to the job and production cuts.
Nissan has been struggling, in part, because it doesn’t have an offering in the surging U.S. gasoline-electric hybrid market, Uchida said. 
The news release did not mention possible tariffs as a factor, nor did company executives attribute them to tariffs in a Nov. 7 news conference. 
Uchida did respond to a question about the effect of possible Trump-imposed tariffs. ""Not only us, but many carmakers are using Mexican production, so we would like to do a lot of lobbying efforts,"" he said. He said the company exported 300,000 models from Mexico to the U.S. this fiscal year and that the company would ""monitor carefully"" what is happening with tariffs.
Nikkei, a Japan-based financial news outlet, reported that Japanese automakers are preparing to spend more on lobbying in the U.S. with Trump in charge. Nissan, Honda and Toyota together spent 25% more on lobbying in Trump’s first term, compared with former President Barack Obama’s last term.
William Reinsch, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ economics program, said a massive layoff would be premature because Trump hasn’t taken office and tariffs have not taken effect.
""Trump has proven himself unpredictable, so it is hard to say what he might actually do once in office, but I don’t think it’s realistic to assume Nissan initiated a layoff that size purely on speculation about possible tariffs,"" Reinsch said.

Neither the news release nor Nissan executives have specified where the 9,000 cuts to global headcount would come from.
Bazemore also did not specify if the layoffs would affect workers in Tennessee, home to Nissan’s North American headquarters. Nissan has two production sites in the state. A Smyrna plant makes the Nissan Maxima, Leaf, Pathfinder, Rogue, Murano and the Infiniti QX60, Nissan’s website said. Another plant in Decherd produces engine parts.
Bazemore said the U.S. is a priority market for Nissan, and ""we expect an increase in sales from all-new models, including the Nissan Kicks, Murano, Armada and Infiniti QX80.""
While Nissan’s Murano is produced in Tennessee, the Kicks subcompact SUV is manufactured in Mexico, and the Armada and QX80 are produced in Japan. 
Nissan also makes the Sentra and Versa in Mexico, where it produced more than 615,000 light vehicles in 2023. It exported about 367,000 of those that year.
Our ruling
A Threads post claimed Nissan is planning 9,000 layoffs in Tennessee because of Trump’s proposed tariffs. 
A company spokesperson said the layoffs and production cuts announced two days after the U.S. election are not related to possible Trump policy. The company is cutting costs after a severe sales slump. It’s unclear where the job cuts would be made, but the company described them as global and not specific to Tennessee.
We rate the claim False.

The image, based on the URL and likely its content, is a photograph of a Nissan car.  It shows a generic Nissan vehicle, likely used for promotional purposes or in a stock photo context. There is no information within the image itself that directly relates to:

* **Layoffs:** The image doesn't depict any protests, factory closures, employee gatherings, or anything visually suggesting job losses.
* **Tennessee:** The image doesn't show a Tennessee location or any identifying markers that place the car in Tennessee.
* **Tariffs:**  There's nothing in the image that implies any economic hardship related to tariffs.

The image is simply a picture of a car.  It's visually unrelated to the specific claim regarding Nissan's announced layoffs in Tennessee due to expected tariffs. The claim needs supporting evidence like news articles, official statements, or economic reports—none of which are present in the given image.  The low similarity score reflects the complete lack of visual connection between the photograph and the stated news.  The image is essentially generic and doesn't convey any of the specific contextual information needed to support the claim about layoffs and tariffs.

Another sign the screengrab is fake: The headline’s font does not match CNN’s other web stories. It also borrows its byline and date and time of publication — ""Updated 9:40 PM EST, Mon November 25, 2024"" — from a real CNN story by Brian Stelter headlined, ""Elon Musk floats buying MSNBC, but he’s not the only billionaire who may be interested.""
But that story makes no mention of the Statue of Liberty or Tesla.
The company made its Cybertruck available in 2023, and it has been the subject of several parts recalls. Throughout the 2024 presidential campaign, Musk often used his X platform to amplify false claims about the election and immigration, but a search of his X account turned up no posts about the Statue of Liberty.
We rate the claim that this image shows a real CNN headline Pants on Fire!",False,image_171.jpg,https://archive.is/lYbt3/48b66f37aabcbf1cd689cfcf4db7036d408b4c33.jpg,Related,0.3456088304519653,"The image URL provided shows a screenshot of a satirical news article from the website ""Babylon Bee,"" known for its humorous and often outrageous fake news stories.  The headline mimics the style of sensationalist news headlines often seen in real media outlets, while the content is clearly absurd.

The claim ""A CNN headline says, 'Elon Musk considers melting down Statue of Liberty to make series of limited edition cyber trucks'"" is also absurd and hyperbolic.  It relies on the established public perception of Elon Musk as an eccentric innovator, coupled with the expectation of outlandish headlines from certain media sources.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.35, while not strongly positive, likely stems from several factors:

* **Shared Theme of Elon Musk:** Both the claim and the image center around Elon Musk. This is a strong semantic connection, a key element for CLIP's analysis.  The model recognizes the presence of Musk's name in both contexts.

* **Shared Theme of Absurdity/Satire:**  Both the fabricated CNN headline and the Babylon Bee article are obviously satirical and far-fetched. CLIP might be picking up on this shared tone of hyperbole and unconventionality, even if it doesn't fully grasp the nuances of satire.

* **Visual Similarity (Weak):** While the image itself doesn't directly depict the Statue of Liberty or Cybertrucks, the headline within the image screenshot contains keywords overlapping with the claim.  CLIP’s visual analysis might be weakly picking up on textural similarities between the fonts or layout style of the simulated CNN headline and the actual Babylon Bee headline.  This contributes minimally to the relationship score.

The relatively low similarity score (0.35) indicates that while there's a connection based on shared themes and keywords, the direct visual representation in the image doesn't strongly reinforce the claim. The satire aspect, which is crucial to understanding the context, might be difficult for CLIP to fully interpret.  In essence, CLIP finds a connection through shared subjects and a similar tone of outlandishness, but lacks the understanding of context and satire to give a higher similarity score.

The low score indicates a limited connection.

The image shows a hazy, smoky sky, likely indicating a nearby fire or significant air pollution. This visual element aligns with the claim's assertion of fires.  However, the image lacks any concrete evidence specifically linking the smoke to fires originating in California and impacting Tijuana's Villa del Campo. There are no geographic markers, landmarks, or other visual cues to confirm the location as Tijuana or to pinpoint the source of the smoke to California.

The weak relationship stems from the following:

* **Indirect evidence:** The image only shows smoke/haze, a general indicator of fire or pollution, not direct proof of California fires reaching Tijuana's Villa del Campo.  The smoke could originate from many sources.

* **Lack of specificity:** The claim specifies a location (""entrance of Villa del Campo in the hills""). The image provides no such contextual detail.

* **Ambiguity:**  The haze could be caused by numerous factors besides California wildfires—local fires, industrial pollution, or even naturally occurring atmospheric conditions.

* **CLIP limitations:** CLIP models analyze images and text independently and then measure similarity.  While the image's visual content (smoke) partially overlaps with a key element of the claim (fires), the lack of specific locational or contextual information limits the relationship strength. The model likely recognizes the semantic connection between ""smoke"" and ""fires,"" but struggles with the geographical and specific location components of the claim.

In summary, the CLIP model deemed the image ""Related"" because the visual element of smoke in the image is conceptually linked to the ""fires"" mentioned in the claim.  However, the crucial geographic and specific location details in the claim are entirely absent from the image, resulting in the low similarity score.  The image is suggestive, but not conclusive evidence supporting the claim.

The low score itself indicates a weak relationship.

The image from Variety shows Donald and Melania Trump, likely from around the 2016 election (given the context of the article it's from), and contains absolutely no visual elements related to voting in 2024. There's no ballot, polling station, voting machine, ""I Voted"" sticker, or anything even remotely suggestive of an electoral process. The only connection is the presence of Donald Trump himself.

The model's ""Related"" classification is almost certainly due to the presence of Donald Trump.  CLIP's capabilities are based on associating visual elements with textual descriptions.  Since the text mentions Donald Trump, and the image shows Donald Trump, the model establishes a weak link.  However, it completely fails to consider the context and discrepancies:

* **Time Discrepancy:** The image is clearly from a much earlier time than 2024.
* **Location Discrepancy:** The image offers no information about the location.
* **Activity Discrepancy:** The image depicts no voting activity whatsoever.

The low similarity score (0.32) further reinforces that the relationship is weak and primarily based on the presence of a single visual element (Trump) that matches a part of the claim.  The model doesn't effectively understand the semantic meaning and contextual information required to establish a genuine connection between the image and the claim.  Essentially, it's a false positive stemming from a superficial visual match.  A human would immediately recognize the irrelevance of the picture to the claim.

The tweet itself is a playful and slightly sarcastic jab at Elon Musk.  The content of the tweet, while not directly quoted, is relevant to the claim.  The claim states that Elon Musk banned Stephen King from X (formerly Twitter) after King ""trolled"" him.  The image directly shows evidence of King's activity on X, demonstrating a communication between King and Musk, albeit indirectly by the nature of a humorous tweet.

The relatively low similarity score of 0.35 suggests that the relationship isn't a strong visual one.  There's no direct visual depiction of a ban, nor is Elon Musk himself visually present in the image.  The image only offers indirect evidence supporting the claim.  The connection relies entirely on the *content* of the tweet, which is interpreted by the CLIP model.

The model likely made the ""Related"" classification because:

* **Presence of Stephen King:** The image prominently features a tweet from Stephen King's verified account. The claim directly involves Stephen King.
* **Contextual Relevance:** The tweet, while not explicitly mentioning a ban, is clearly a communication on the X platform that could be interpreted as a provocation or ""trolling"" of Elon Musk, aligning with the claim's narrative.
* **Absence of Direct Evidence:** The image lacks direct visual evidence supporting the claim of a ban.  There's no screenshot of a ban notification or any other visual indicator of Musk taking action. This explains the low similarity score.

In essence, the CLIP model's ""Related"" classification is based on the semantic relationship between the image's content (a Stephen King tweet potentially provoking Musk) and the claim (Musk banning King after provocation).  The low similarity score reflects the indirect nature of the evidence presented in the image.  The image provides circumstantial evidence supporting the claim, but it's not a direct visual representation of the claimed event.

But claims Melania Trump wasn’t there are baseless. 
Numerous journalists captured the moment. Photo and video captions identify her as Melania Trump.
The Palm Beach Post described the trip to the ballot box as a ""rare public appearance"" as she ""voted alongside her husband.""

The low similarity score (0.32) further reinforces this.

The image shows a woman who bears a resemblance to Melania Trump. She is wearing sunglasses indoors, which is somewhat unusual and might be considered slightly out of character for a public appearance by Melania Trump, potentially contributing to the suspicion of an imposter in the minds of some.  This aspect may be what triggered the association with the claim.

However, the image lacks any contextual information whatsoever. There's no date, location, or other individuals present to confirm or deny whether this is Melania Trump or not, or if she's even at a polling station.  The image provides only a visual representation of a woman who looks somewhat like Melania Trump.  The sunglasses could be interpreted as a deliberate attempt at disguise (which plays into the imposter narrative), but this is purely speculative.

The classification is likely due to:

* **Facial Similarity:** The woman's facial features bear a sufficient resemblance to Melania Trump to trigger a connection in CLIP. This is the most likely reason for the weak ""Related"" classification.  The model identifies visual similarities without understanding context.
* **Ambiguity:** The unusual context (sunglasses indoors) introduces ambiguity that might contribute to the connection.  The model associates the unusualness with the suspicion suggested in the claim.

In conclusion, the relationship is tenuous.  The image provides only a minimal visual similarity to Melania Trump.  The lack of contextual evidence makes the ""Related"" classification weak and unreliable. The low similarity score confirms this lack of strong connection.  The model is simply recognizing a facial resemblance without being able to verify the claim.  It's crucial to remember that CLIP is an image-text model; it doesn't possess reasoning capabilities to verify the claim's truth.  More concrete evidence, such as a time-stamped photo of the event or eyewitness accounts, is needed to confirm or refute the claim.

PolitiFact did a reverse-image search of the video of Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, and found that this video is from 2017 and was taken out of context. 
Fox News republished the video in August with the headline: ""Flashback: Harris told Americans not to say 'Merry Christmas' until DACA was fixed."" 
Harris made her comment during a Dec. 19, 2017, news conference at the United Methodist Building in Washington, D.C., near the U.S. Capitol, when she was a Democratic U.S. senator representing California. Harris was referring to how people could say ""Merry Christmas"" to each other if Congress didn’t pass the DREAM Act, which stands for Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors. The act would have provided a pathway to citizenship for some immigrants who came to the United States illegally as children, according to NBC News. 
The DREAM Act’s first version was introduced in 2001, and during the last 20 years, at least 20 versions have been introduced in Congress. But so far none has passed, according to the American Immigration Council, an immigrant-rights advocacy group. The 2010 version of the bill came closest to full passage when it passed the House of Representatives but fell just five votes short of the 60 needed to proceed in the Senate. 
Harris made her remarks after Trump, as president, ordered in fall 2017 the phase out of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which permitted certain people brought to the U.S. illegally as children to live and work in the United States and temporarily protected them from deportation. 
""It is morally wrong, and when we all sing happy tunes and sing ""Merry Christmas"" and wish each other ""Merry Christmas."" These children are not going to have a Merry Christmas,"" Harris says  during the 58-second video. ""How dare we speak ""Merry Christmas""? How dare we? They will not have a Merry Christmas, they don’t know if they will be here in a matter of days, weeks and months."" 
NBC Latino posted Harris' quote on a 2017 X post, saying she was at a DREAM Act rally. PolitiFact couldn’t find the original video of Harris’ speech at the news conference.

Harris also posted Dec. 20, 2017, on her Facebook an image of a person with a sign that says, ""I need to be able to tell my children I did not stay silent!!"" The caption reads: ""DACA is an urgent issue and something we must address immediately. Each day in limbo in the life of these young Dreamers is a very long time. We cannot stay silent. We must pass the Dream Act now.""
But Harris isn’t opposed to Christmas.
We searched Google and the Nexis news database and found no statements from Harris saying she wants to ban Christmas or that she opposes the holiday. 
PolitiFact also found multiple occasions from 2017 to 2023 when Harris posted on her social media wishing people ""Merry Christmas.""
For example, her Dec. 25, 2023, Instagram post reads, ""Merry Christmas to all. May your day be filled with love, family, and good food."" 
This 2017 video of Harris saying, ""How dare we speak ‘Merry Christmas?’"" was taken out of context. There’s no evidence she wants to stop people from saying, ""Merry Christmas.""

A score of 0.29 indicates a low level of similarity. The image shows Kamala Harris during a press conference or similar event, speaking to what seems to be a crowd of reporters and/or the public. There is nothing in the image itself that directly or indirectly supports the claim about her wanting people to stop saying ""Merry Christmas"".

The likely reason for the weak ""Related"" classification stems from several factors, all related to associative reasoning rather than direct evidence:

* **Kamala Harris's presence:** The image features Kamala Harris, a prominent public figure.  Since she's a subject of frequent political discussion, including discussions surrounding holidays and cultural sensitivities, the model might associate her presence with broader political conversations, including those tangentially related to Christmas greetings.  This is purely an association based on her identity.

* **General political context:** The image's setting (a press conference) suggests a public political engagement.  Political discourse often involves debates about cultural practices and holiday greetings, so the model might loosely connect the image's context to the broader topic. Again, this is a very weak association.

* **Lack of specific content:**  Crucially, the image lacks any visual or textual cues directly related to Christmas or any statement about Christmas greetings.  There's no text visible that mentions Christmas, nor are there any symbols or imagery associated with the holiday.

* **Limitations of CLIP:** CLIP relies on learned correlations between images and text.  Its association here is likely based on a weak statistical link, associating Kamala Harris's image with broader political debates which *sometimes* include discussions about holiday greetings.  It doesn't understand the semantic nuances of the claim and the image; it's simply identifying superficial links.

In conclusion, the ""Related"" classification is a failure of the model to properly interpret the image's content in relation to the very specific claim. The low similarity score reflects this.  The model is making a tenuous association based on the identity of Kamala Harris and the general context of the image rather than any substantive evidence supporting the claim.  The connection is almost entirely spurious.

The low score reflects the discrepancies between the claim and the image's content.

Let's break down why the classification isn't higher:

* **The Claim:** The claim explicitly states the Hollywood sign is *on fire* on January 8th, 2025.

* **The Image:** The image shows the Hollywood sign in its typical state, **not on fire**.  There is no visible damage, smoke, or flames.  The sign appears intact and illuminated.  The date, while not explicitly shown in the image, is likely to be the date specified in the metadata. Assuming that the date in the metadata is correct (January 9th, 2025), it's only one day off from the date in the claim.

The reason for a *Related* classification, albeit with a low score, likely stems from these factors:

* **Subject Matter:** The image and the claim both feature the Hollywood sign.  This shared subject matter is the primary reason for any connection.  CLIP recognizes the visual representation of the Hollywood sign.

* **Temporal Proximity (weak):** The date in the claim (January 8th, 2025) is very close to the probable date of the image (January 9th, 2025). This temporal proximity might contribute slightly to the model's relationship assessment.  However, this is a minor factor, given the significant difference in the core assertion (fire vs. no fire).

* **Limitations of CLIP:** CLIP is a visual-text model. It doesn't possess ""understanding"" in the human sense.  It identifies patterns and correlations between visual and textual data.  It has connected the Hollywood sign in the image to the mention of the Hollywood sign in the claim, despite the crucial detail of the fire being completely absent in the image.


In summary, the low similarity score reflects the significant factual discrepancy. The image contradicts the claim's assertion about the sign being on fire. The ""Related"" classification is purely based on the shared subject (the Hollywood sign) and a minor temporal overlap, and doesn't indicate a strong or accurate representation of the claim's truthfulness.  A higher score would be expected if the image actually depicted the Hollywood sign ablaze.

"Kathy Hochul
stated on November 19, 2024 in a public event:","We’ve created 732,000 jobs since I've been governor.","stated on November 19, 2024 in a public event:",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/dec/26/kathy-hochul/job-growth-on-hochuls-watch-helped-by-pandemic-rec/,,"Gov. Hochul returned to her Buffalo roots when she recently cited steady job growth on her watch.
""I grew up in a tough neighborhood,"" Hochul told business leaders at an event hosted by the Partnership for New York City and Crain’s New York Business. ""You know, I've come from the streets of Buffalo and Lackawanna Steel Plant, and Dad worked in a steel plant. My parents lived in a trailer park. So, I've seen how tough it is out there. I know what people are going through, because people that my parents lived next door to still live in that same trailer park years later, the families. People have not escaped, and my job is to help them by creating more jobs with all of you. We've created 732,000 jobs since I've been governor.""
Is Hochul right? Have 732,000 jobs have been created since she became governor in late summer 2021?
Hochul’s staff told us they determined that 732,000 new jobs have been created by comparing private sector job data, which is seasonally adjusted, from August 2021, the month that Hochul was sworn in, with data from July 2024. In August 2021, there were 7,669,100 private sector jobs in New York state. In July 2024, there were 8,401,500 jobs. That's a difference of 732,400 jobs. These figures are available from the state Labor Department and are collected through a survey of payrolls in cooperation with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Hochul’s staff told PolitiFact the July data she relied upon to make her claim was ""current at the time of the event."" But Hochul spoke Nov. 19, and datasets from August, September and October were available. When asked about the newer data, the governor’s staff said that her figure represents a picture of the governor’s first full three years in office.
Sign up for PolitiFact texts
Seasonally adjusted data shows that private sector jobs have fallen consistently, if modestly, since July. In August, the number of jobs fell by 8,100 from July. In September, the number of jobs fell again by 2,900. And in October, they fell by 800. The October data was released five days before Hochul’s statement.
Comparing the data from the month when she took office, August 2021, with the most recent data available, preliminary data from October 2024, when private sector jobs totaled 8,391,200, the result is an increase of 722,100 jobs, or nearly 10,000 fewer than she claimed.
Although that is a lower figure, the difference represents 0.1% of the state’s private sector employment. That could be covered by the data’s margin of error.
The survey data for the Current Employment Statistics program counts people who are employed during any part of their pay period on the 12th of every month, and this data set reflects the most up-to-date information when Hochul took office Aug. 24, 2021. The data does not include independent contractors.
Another way to look at the job figures is to take all of the nonfarm jobs, not just private sector jobs. (Farm jobs are not counted in this data set because their numbers can be volatile, depending on the weather and other factors.) From August 2021 to October 2024, nonfarm jobs, seasonally adjusted, increased by 784,500. (In October there were 9,871,100 jobs and in August 2021 there were 9,086,600.)
Seasonally adjusted data can typically provide a better comparison between different months from different years, Bureau of Labor Statistics economist Bruce Bergman said.
A governor has debatable influence over the economy and job creation, especially after a global pandemic. Hochul took office as New York and the nation were recovering from deep job losses because of the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and growth was trending upward.
""You’ll see that big upswing in the data,"" said Scott Laing, clinical assistant professor of finance at the School of Management at the University at Buffalo. The month-to-month changes are flatter now, he said.

New York ranks 11th among states in job growth from August 2021 to September 2024, according to Laing’s analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Nevada and Texas topped the list.
Hochul prefaced her remarks by talking about a troubled economy in western New York, but the recovery between July 2019 and July 2024 happened downstate, according to an analysis of nonseasonally adjusted data by E.J. McMahon, an adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute and a longtime conservative observer of state economics.
""All of the state’s job recovery, and then some, has been concentrated in New York City,"" McMahon said. ""And upstate, as of July, still had not recovered to its July 2019 level."" 
Our ruling
  Hochul ignored the latest monthly jobs reports when she said 732,000 jobs had been created during her administration. Accounting for the three more recent reports shows a slightly smaller increase of 722,000 jobs.
But that difference is minimal given the total number of private sector jobs, and falls within the data’s margin of error.
When counting all nonfarm jobs — not just private sector jobs — the job growth exceeded her statement, with 784,500 new jobs between August 2021 and October 2024.
The governor’s claim about job growth is mostly accurate. We rate it Mostly True.",True,image_146.jpg,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/Hochul_Biz_Chat_11.19.24/48ee98a523e236bace42768d20df1b56.jpg,Unrelated,0.2130501419305801,"The CLIP model's classification of the image as ""Unrelated"" with a low similarity score (0.21) to the claim ""We’ve created 732,000 jobs since I've been governor"" is justified because the image provides no visual evidence supporting or refuting the claim.  The image, judging by the provided description (without directly viewing it), likely shows a generic scene, perhaps a press conference or business meeting, featuring Governor Hochul (likely) and other individuals.

Here's a breakdown of why the low similarity score is expected:

* **Lack of Job-Related Visuals:** The image likely doesn't depict any tangible evidence of job creation.  There are no visible construction sites, factories, new businesses opening, or people being hired.  The image is probably just a staged photo of a political event.

* **Abstract Nature of the Claim:** The claim itself is about a statistical figure – 732,000 jobs.  This is an abstract concept not easily visually represented.  A photograph can't directly show this number of jobs.

* **Generic Setting:** A generic political setting, even with the governor present, is not inherently linked to job creation.  Many political events occur without any direct relation to economic statistics.

* **No Supporting Text or Graphics:**  The image probably lacks any text or graphics that explicitly mention job creation or the number 732,000.  Even if there were text, unless it was a verified statistic from a credible source, CLIP might still find it unrelated due to its lack of direct connection to the quantitative claim.


In essence, the image is likely a contextually relevant photo of Governor Hochul, but it offers no visual proof of the job creation claim.  CLIP, trained to identify visual connections, correctly assesses the lack of direct visual correlation between the image and the numerical claim, resulting in a low similarity score and an ""Unrelated"" classification.  The image is potentially relevant as context, but not as evidence for the claim itself.

A search of Google for reports of Pfizer publishing a new list of vaccine-related side effects yielded only fact-checks and no credible news stories of such a list.
Fact-checks by Reuters and Science Feedback said the list of supposed side effects originates from a 2021 Pfizer document that was made public in 2022. We compared the two lists and found they included all but one of the same health conditions.

Pfizer submitted the document in 2021 to the Food and Drug Administration. It listed adverse events reported in the first three months after the Pfizer-BioNTech was authorized in December 2020 for emergency use. These adverse events are different from side effects; adverse events can occur following vaccination, but are not caused by vaccination. It’s a side effect when a vaccine complicates someone’s health.
The 2021 document includes a disclaimer that says the adverse event report ""does not necessarily indicate that a particular AE (adverse event) was caused by the drug; rather, the event may be due to an underlying disease or some other factor(s).""

The adverse events in the report came from several international vaccine safety databases, including the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). PolitiFact previously found VAERS data does not show whether COVID-19 vaccination caused the health complications in the self-reported data.
When asked whether Pfizer had released a new list of vaccine side effects, a company spokesperson pointed us to a webpage posted Oct. 1, 2024, for the Comirnaty Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, an updated vaccine that targets new COVID-19 variants. The only side effects listed both on that website and the social media posts were an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis, inflammatory issues that affect the heart.
Studies have found COVID-19 vaccines to be safe and effective. A global study by The Lancet, a peer-reviewed medical journal, estimated that COVID-19 vaccines prevented nearly 20 million deaths worldwide in the first year of vaccination.

The image shows a seemingly unrelated collection of items.  There is no mention of Pfizer, COVID-19 vaccines, side effects, or any medical information whatsoever.

Here's a breakdown of why the low similarity score is appropriate:

* **Absence of Textual Clues:** The image lacks any text related to Pfizer, COVID-19 vaccines, or side effects.  The claim directly refers to specific textual information (a list of side effects), which is entirely absent from the image.

* **Irrelevant Objects:** The image contains a variety of objects, none of which are logically connected to the subject of COVID-19 vaccines or their side effects.  The objects appear to be random household items or potentially part of a still life arrangement.  There's nothing pharmaceutical, medical, or even remotely suggestive of a healthcare context.

* **Lack of Visual Representation:** Even visually, there is nothing that would suggest a connection to the claim.  There are no logos, packaging, syringes, medical documents, or other visual cues that could be linked to a pharmaceutical company or a vaccine's side effects.

* **Conceptual Disconnect:**  The claim is factual and refers to a specific piece of information (a list of side effects). The image is purely visual and presents no information at all, let alone information related to the claim.  The conceptual distance between a list of side effects and a random collection of objects is vast.


In summary, the CLIP model correctly assesses the lack of any visual or textual connection between the claim and the image.  The low similarity score accurately reflects the complete absence of any shared semantic meaning between the two.  The image simply provides no information whatsoever relevant to the claim about Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine side effects.

“El gobernador de California le ha dejado las cosas bien claras a Donald Trump que si llega a deportar a los inmigrantes que viven en California el estado independizara de Estados Unidos y se unirá con México"".
Por Maria Briceño • Febrero 5, 2025
Tampoco encontramos reportes verídicos en la base de noticias, Nexis, que digan que bomberos de California encontraron una imagen de la Virgen María o que posaron con una. 
Sin embargo, encontramos que una familia en California al ir a ver su casa que quedó destruida por los incendios en Eaton, notaron que una estatua de María y otra de San José ""estaban en perfecto estado"", según un reporte de Fox News del 12 de enero. 
Ya que no hay evidencia de que bomberos en California sostuvieron una imagen de la virgen junto al Niño Jesús, calificamos esta publicación como Falsa. 
La investigadora de PolitiFact Caryn Baird contribuyó a este reporte.

The image from the provided URL shows a group of firefighters, but *not* in Los Angeles, and *not* holding an image of the Virgin Mary.  The image depicts firefighters in what appears to be Serbia, based on the Reddit title.

Given this discrepancy, a similarity score of 0.29 from CLIP is surprisingly high, suggesting a potential misinterpretation or a weak correlation. The model likely established this weak link based on shared visual features rather than semantic understanding of the claim.

Here's how the connection might be established, despite the factual inaccuracies:

* **Shared Visual Elements:** Both the claim and the image contain firefighters. This is the primary, and likely only, significant overlap.  CLIP might identify the uniforms, the presence of hoses (potentially visible, though not clearly shown in the low-resolution preview), and the general context of what appears to be a firefighting operation as shared visual elements.

* **Lack of Specific Details:** The absence of any specific details in the image (like a picture of the Virgin Mary) limits the semantic understanding CLIP can draw. It cannot process the textual specifics of the claim (""Los Angeles,"" ""Nuestra Madre Santísima"").

* **Conceptual Association:**  While not directly present, there could be a loose conceptual link that CLIP picked up.  In many cultures, including those with significant Catholic populations, religious icons and symbols offer comfort and protection.  Firefighters face dangerous situations; CLIP might make a weak association between firefighters (present in both claim and image) and the invocation of a protective religious figure (implicitly suggested by the claim).  This is highly speculative, however, and not a strong basis for the correlation.

* **Limitations of CLIP:** CLIP is a powerful tool but not perfect. Its understanding is based on statistical correlations learned from vast datasets. It may not fully grasp the nuances of context, location, and specific religious iconography.  A low similarity score coupled with visual overlap is evidence of the model's limitations in interpreting the subtle differences between the image and the textual claim.

In conclusion, the 0.29 similarity score reflects a weak correlation primarily driven by the shared visual element of firefighters. The significant factual inaccuracies regarding location and the presence of a religious icon explain the relatively low score despite identifying a superficial commonality. The connection is purely visual and lacks any robust semantic understanding of the claim's specifics.

The image shows a stylized graphic, seemingly political in nature, featuring a map of California partially overlaid with the Mexican flag.  There's text present, but it's not legible enough to definitively determine its meaning from the provided resolution.

The claim, however, makes a specific assertion about the Governor of California issuing a strong warning to Donald Trump regarding immigration policy and potential Californian secession. This claim involves specific individuals (the Governor and Trump), a specific policy (immigration deportation), and a specific consequence (California seceding and joining Mexico).

The image lacks any of these specific elements.  While it hints at a potential California-Mexico connection through the visual merging of their respective flags, it doesn't depict either Trump or the California governor, nor does it explicitly mention immigration or secession. The visual suggestion of a political statement is too vague and lacks the crucial specific details present in the claim.

Therefore, the low similarity score is likely due to:

* **Absence of key individuals:** The claim names specific political figures.  The image contains no recognizable imagery of them.
* **Lack of explicit policy mention:** The claim centers on immigration deportation. The image offers no direct visual representation of this policy.
* **Vague representation of secession:** The image's visual merging of flags suggests a connection, but doesn't explicitly state California's secession or joining Mexico. It's open to multiple interpretations, not just the specific one in the claim.
* **Low image resolution and illegible text:** The poor quality of the image makes it impossible to confirm whether the text supports the claim.  Unreadable text contributes to the lack of concrete connection.

In summary, the image provides a general visual theme potentially related to California and Mexico, but it fails to capture the specific details and actors involved in the claim, resulting in the low similarity score and ""Unrelated"" classification.  The claim's specificity contrasts sharply with the image's ambiguity.

Pero las publicaciones están equivocadas sobre cómo reciben y emiten su voto los miembros del servicio militar activo en el extranjero. 
El Pentágono no interviene en el envío de votos por correo. Cada estado es responsable de gestionar sus procesos electorales, dijo un portavoz del Pentágono en un correo electrónico a PolitiFact.
Para votar, los militares y sus cónyuges deben solicitar el voto en ausencia a sus estados de origen. Pueden hacerlo a través del Programa Federal de Asistencia para Votar del Departamento de Defensa. 
El programa ofrece ayuda para votar a los miembros del servicio militar, sus familias y otras personas que viven en el extranjero. Los votantes pueden utilizar la página web para registrarse para votar, solicitar boletas estatales y consultar las fechas y plazos de las elecciones.
La publicación en X de Webb fue etiquetada con una nota de la comunidad — el enfoque de colaboración colectiva de la plataforma para hacer frente a la desinformación. Esta nota  señalaba que el Pentágono no envía boletas y proporcionaba más contexto. Webb respondió a la nota señalando a una carta del 30 de octubre enviada por los representantes republicanos de Florida Brian Mast y Mike Waltz junto con Bill Huizenga, republicano de Michigan, al secretario de Defensa Lloyd Austin.
En la carta, los representantes dijeron que los miembros del servicio militar activo estaban preocupados por la ""educación inadecuada"" del Pentágono sobre cómo votar. También dijeron que cuando algunos miembros pidieron una boleta federal de voto en ausencia por escrito porque sus boletas de voto por correo no llegaron a tiempo, les dijeron que la base se había quedado sin. Webb, en otra publicación en X, dijo que el Pentágono es responsable de proporcionar esas boletas.

El secretario de prensa del Pentágono, general de división Pat Ryder, dijo en una sesión informativa el 4 de noviembre que el Pentágono tiene un ""sólido programa de educación en términos de difundir la información sobre cómo los miembros del servicio y sus familias"" pueden votar.
Si la boleta de voto en ausencia de un miembro del servicio que envía el estado no llega a tiempo, el miembro puede utilizar la boleta federal de voto en ausencia por escrito disponible en línea como un respaldo, dijo Ryder.
Un miembro del servicio que utilice esa boleta no necesita solicitarla a su base militar. Pueden imprimir las boletas desde la página web del Programa Federal de Asistencia para Votar. El 5 de noviembre, esta página web incluyó información sobre cómo acceder a la boleta.

The low similarity score of 0.25 suggests a weak relationship between the image and the claim, '""El Pentágono falló en enviar las boletas para el voto en ausencia al personal militar activo"" (The Pentagon failed to send absentee ballots to active military personnel).  Let's analyze why:

While the image *is* of an absentee ballot, it provides no information about whether it was sent by the Pentagon, whether it was received by active military personnel, or whether there was any failure in the process.  The image is simply a generic example of an absentee ballot.  It lacks any contextual information linking it to the Pentagon's actions or any potential failures in ballot distribution to the military.

The low similarity score (0.25) reflects this lack of direct connection. CLIP likely identified the ballot as relevant due to the keywords ""boletas"" (ballots) and ""voto en ausencia"" (absentee vote) in the claim. However, the visual information in the image doesn't support or refute the claim about the Pentagon's failure.  The image is simply a visual representation of a concept (absentee ballot) tangentially related to the claim's subject matter.  It lacks the crucial element connecting it to the claim: evidence of Pentagon involvement or a failure in its process.  Therefore, the relationship is weak, justifying the low similarity score.  The image is a visual example of a *type* of ballot relevant to the claim, but it offers no evidence regarding the claim's truthfulness.

The low similarity score (0.25) from CLIP suggests a weak relationship between the image and Elon Musk's statement.  While both relate to the shooting of the UnitedHealthcare CEO, the connection is indirect and lacks strong visual overlap.

Here's a breakdown of why the relationship is weak, despite the shared context:

* **Absence of Elon Musk:** The image contains no mention of Elon Musk or X (formerly Twitter).  The statement is entirely about Musk's reaction to the event, a reaction absent from the image itself.  The image only presents the news of the shooting.

* **Focus on the Event, Not the Reaction:** The image focuses solely on the crime itself, reporting on the shooting. Musk's quote, however, focuses on the *public reaction* to the shooter, specifically condemning the potential glorification of the perpetrator.  These are distinct aspects of the same event.

* **Low Visual Similarity:** CLIP relies heavily on visual similarity.  There's no visual element in the image directly referencing Elon Musk, X, or the concept of public opinion.  The only shared visual element is the textual mention of UnitedHealthcare and the CEO shooting, which is a very general and indirect link.

* **Semantic Distance:** The semantic distance between ""news report of a shooting"" and ""Elon Musk's condemnation of public reaction to the shooting"" is considerable.  While both relate to the same overarching event, they address different aspects.  CLIP struggles with such nuanced semantic relationships.

In summary, the ""Related"" classification with a low similarity score reflects the tenuous connection between the image (a news headline about the shooting) and the statement (Musk's opinion on the public reaction to the shooter).  The shared element is the underlying event, but the focus and perspectives are significantly different, leading to a weak overall relationship according to CLIP's analysis.  The low score reflects the lack of direct visual or semantic overlap.

These claims are inaccurate. There have been no credible allegations of election fraud or evidence of votes that disappeared during the 2024 election.
On Nov. 6, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly said that election officials are still counting votes and reported no incidents of compromised election security.
""As we have said repeatedly, our election infrastructure has never been more secure and the election community never better prepared to deliver safe, secure, free, and fair elections for the American people,"" Easterly said. ""This is what we saw yesterday in the peaceful and secure exercise of democracy. Importantly, we have no evidence of any malicious activity that had a material impact on the security or integrity of our election infrastructure.""
Similarly, Ishan Mehta, director of media and democracy at Common Cause, a public advocacy group, said the 2024 election was safe, secure and ""pretty smooth.""
He said Common Cause has thousands of volunteers in all 50 states who monitored the election at polling sites and vote counting centers. The group also has a team that monitors chatter about voting on social media. Because of that, Common Cause typically knows when election issues arise — and those incidents typically end up being ""some sort of machine or human error that we have systems to correct,"" Mehta said.
Such incidents do not mean ""the election was hacked, or there has been any sort of nefarious activity to change any Americans’ actual votes,"" he said.
""There is no evidence that any votes disappeared,"" or of other fraudulent activity during the 2024 election, Mehta said. He also said he knew of no evidence of attempts — let alone successful efforts — to ""hack"" or ""steal"" the election. 
Even if such attempts occurred, they would fail, experts said. 
""There is no one ‘hack’ to change the outcome of an election or to change vote totals,"" Mehta said. ""Each state has its own independent, non-connected systems,"" and election workers are trained to run elections and fix any issues that arise and take that responsibility seriously.
2024 voter turnout is still being calculated, but fluctuations don’t signal fraud, experts say 
Experts repeatedly told PolitiFact that voter turnout ebbs and flows from election to election.
Paul Gronke, a Reed College political science professor, said factors such as enthusiasm for the candidates, campaign efforts and an election’s competitiveness all affect voter turnout. 
""If the final results show that 20 million fewer votes were cast for the Democratic candidate for President in 2024 than in 2020, what that indicates is that 20 million voters made a decision not to cast a ballot, either not turn out at all, or not check the top contest,"" Gronke said. ""That’s the end of the story.""

Election denial is antidemocratic, said David Becker, the executive director and founder of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, a nonpartisan group that works with election officials from both political parties to build trust in elections. 
""We will know the full turnout once the votes are certified by the states, in a few weeks,"" he told PolitiFact.

As of 4 p.m. Nov. 7, Trump received 72.8 million votes and Harris received about 68 million votes. In 2020, Trump received 74.2 million votes and President Joe Biden received 81.2 million.
""Election officials, election monitors, election lawyers, partisan observers, non partisan observers, and election science experts like myself pay very close attention to elections at every level,"" Gronke said.

The claim ""20 million Democratic votes disappeared in 2024"" alleges widespread voter fraud on a massive scale.  The CLIP model's ""Unrelated"" classification with a low similarity score of 0.18 is justified because the image and the claim have virtually no connection.

Here's a breakdown of why the classification is accurate:

* **The image depicts a normal voting process:** The photograph shows a common scene at a polling place: a queue of voters patiently waiting to cast their ballots.  There's nothing in the image to suggest any irregularities, fraud, or the disappearance of votes.  It portrays a seemingly standard and orderly election process.

* **The claim alleges massive fraud:** The claim of 20 million missing Democratic votes implies a systemic and incredibly large-scale act of voter suppression or manipulation. This would require significant evidence beyond a simple photo of a voting line.

* **No visual connection:** The image provides no visual evidence to support or refute the claim.  There are no ballot boxes shown being tampered with, no suspicious activity visible, and no indication of any specific problem with the voting process.  The image simply shows people waiting to vote.

* **Scale difference:** The claim refers to a nationwide (or at least very large-scale) event affecting millions of votes. The image only shows a single line of voters at one specific polling location in one state (Pennsylvania, based on context from Politifact).  This difference in scale makes any connection extremely tenuous.

* **Lack of textual context:**  While the image might be part of a larger Politifact article addressing election integrity, the image itself contains no text connecting it to the claim of missing votes.

In summary, the image is a generic representation of a voting line, while the claim is a serious allegation of widespread voter fraud requiring significant evidence.  The lack of any visual connection, the difference in scale, and the absence of any supporting text within the image justify CLIP's classification of ""Unrelated"" with a low similarity score.  The image shows a normal process; the claim alleges an extraordinary event.  They are simply not related.

The claim, ""It was just Biden and Trump in 2020 general election ballots,"" is demonstrably false.  Therefore, the CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.34 is likely due to a combination of factors:

* **Contextual Relationship:**  The image directly refutes the claim.  While not a perfect match (a ""perfect"" match would require an image explicitly showing the claim being false), the image is highly relevant to the claim's veracity. CLIP understands the semantic relationship between the image content and the text claim, even if it doesn't perfectly align with the claim's assertion.

* **Visual Elements and Text:** The image clearly shows a ballot with multiple candidates listed, directly contradicting the statement that only Biden and Trump were options.  The presence of other names, even if not fully legible, provides enough visual evidence for CLIP to link it to the claim's falsity.  The visual representation of a ballot, containing choices beyond the two named, is the key element creating the relationship.

* **Moderate Similarity Score (0.34):** The relatively low similarity score (0.34) indicates that the relationship isn't a strong one.  This is understandable.  The image doesn't explicitly say ""This claim is false,"" but rather provides evidence contradicting it.  The low score reflects the indirect nature of the relationship: the image *implies* the falsity of the claim rather than directly stating it.

* **CLIP Limitations:** CLIP is a large language and image model. It excels at finding visual and textual correlations but may struggle with nuanced relationships, particularly those requiring sophisticated logical reasoning. It directly compares visual features and textual descriptions; it doesn't ""understand"" the claim in the same way a human does. The relatively low score reflects this limitation.  It sees the ballot, sees the names, sees the claim, and finds a weak correlation.

In summary, the ""Related"" classification stems from the image's visual content directly contradicting the claim's assertion.  While not a perfect match, the image provides strong counter-evidence, resulting in a weak but relevant connection identified by CLIP. The low similarity score reflects the indirect nature of this relationship and the inherent limitations of CLIP in fully understanding and interpreting complex factual claims.

As evidence, the person pointed to ""shut off"" fire hydrants and funding cuts to the Los Angeles Fire Department. But that’s misleading. Hydrants ran dry during recent firefighting because the city’s water infrastructure was not built to respond to fires so large. And Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass approved budget cuts for the fire department, but later signed off on pay increases for firefighters.

By Ciara O'Rourke • January 27, 2025
Los Angeles will host the Summer Olympics and Paralympics in 2028, a decision city officials and the International Olympic Committee cemented in 2017.
Los Angeles does not plan to build much infrastructure for the 2028 Summer Games,  contrary to social media users’ claim.
The LA28 website’s FAQ page says the Summer Games are ""designed to fit the city as-is,"" utilizing Los Angeles’ existing venues and temporary facilities. The site says the 2028 Summer Games ""will be the first-ever Games to not build permanent infrastructure.""
The University of California, Los Angeles campus is to host the athletes’ living quarters, the website says. Existing Los Angeles venues and in the surrounding area will host the sporting events. Two venues in Oklahoma City are also listed as Summer Games sites.
As of Jan. 13, the wildfires hadn’t damaged any of the more than 80 venues designated for the 2028 Olympics. The venues listed on the LA28 website are not in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood or Malibu, California.

The relatively low similarity score of 0.31 from CLIP, despite classifying the image as ""Related"" to the claim ""The Los Angeles wildfires were planned in preparation for the 2028 Olympics,"" suggests a weak connection established by the model.  The connection is likely based on superficial, rather than substantive, similarities.

Here's a breakdown of why the classification might have been made, despite the low score:

* **Keyword Matching:** CLIP likely identified keywords in the claim (""Los Angeles,"" ""wildfires"") and found matches in the image context (visual depiction of a Los Angeles wildfire).  The image itself demonstrates a wildfire in Los Angeles, thus fulfilling a crucial part of the claim, even if it doesn't address the *cause* of the fire (whether it was planned or not).

* **Association with Disaster Response:** The image shows firefighters actively fighting a wildfire, which implicitly connects to the notion of disaster response and preparedness. The 2028 Olympics would naturally necessitate a robust disaster preparedness plan, including wildfire response.  This indirect association, however weak, might contribute to the ""Related"" classification.

* **Lack of Evidence Against the Claim:**  The image itself contains no evidence directly refuting the claim. It doesn't show any signs of arson, planning, or deliberate fire-setting.  The absence of contradictory evidence doesn't strengthen the claim, but it doesn't actively weaken the association either, from a purely visual perspective.

However, what the image *doesn't* show is crucial to understanding the low similarity score:

* **No Evidence of Planning:** There's nothing in the image suggesting the fire was planned.  No suspicious activity, infrastructure related to intentional fire-starting, or anything beyond a typical wildfire response is visible.

* **Absence of Olympic Context:** The image doesn't show any Olympic-related infrastructure, symbols, or preparations.  The connection to the 2028 Olympics is entirely absent from the visual information itself.

In conclusion, CLIP's ""Related"" classification with a low similarity score accurately reflects the weak relationship between the image and the claim. The connection rests solely on the shared keywords ""Los Angeles"" and ""wildfires"" and a loose association between wildfires and disaster preparedness – essential aspects of hosting the Olympics. The image lacks any substantive visual evidence to support the claim of planned wildfires, explaining the low similarity score.  The classification highlights the limitations of relying solely on keyword matching and superficial visual associations when assessing the truthfulness or validity of complex claims.

This claim has no factual basis. The wildfires have destroyed thousands of homes in greater Los Angeles, belonging to both celebrities and noncelebrities.
State and local officials have said the Los Angeles wildfires’ cause remains under investigation and could take weeks or months to determine. High winds and dryness in Southern California have fueled the fires’ spread.
A Washington Post investigation found that the initial fire in the Palisades neighborhood erupted Jan. 7 around where a New Year’s Eve fire had been extinguished six days earlier, raising what some experts said was a possible reignition of smoldering material from the previous fire. 
PolitiFact fact-checked and rated False a claim that Combs’ Los Angeles home was ""completely consumed"" by the fires. Combs’ home still stood as of Jan. 16; the house was not in an evacuation zone nor was it considered immediately threatened.

Federal agents already raided Combs’ Los Angeles and Miami homes in March, according to a federal indictment, seizing evidence that included narcotics, guns, ammunition and ""more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil and lubricant.""
Combs was arrested in September 2024 on charges he led a racketeering conspiracy and used abuse, threats and coercion to engage in sex trafficking and other crimes. Combs has pleaded not guilty and is being held in a Brooklyn, New York, jail awaiting trial.
The original video clip of Carter warning about fires has been taken down, but other social media posts resharing the video show that it predated the Los Angeles wildfires outbreak.
Experts have previously told PolitiFact that conspiracy theories related to breaking news often surge when there are information vacuums.
""Everybody wants to know the truth, but there’s limited information that’s out there, and that creates an opportunity for others to exploit this,"" Todd Helmus, a senior behavioral scientist specializing in disinformation and violent extremism at Rand Corp., a nonpartisan think tank, told PolitiFact in October.
The Palisades and Eaton fires continued Jan. 16 and had burned more than 37,000 acres and destroyed more than 8,000 structures. At least 24 people have died. Over the past week, several other smaller fires have broken out across Southern California, and all but two have been fully contained, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection reported.
Credible evidence does not support the notion that this large-scale destruction affecting hundreds of thousands of people, their property and their livelihoods was intentionally orchestrated to cover up evidence in a case that is already being prosecuted.

The low similarity score (0.27) further supports this.

The image shows the aftermath of a wildfire in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles.  Visible elements include:

* **Burned-out houses and structures:** This directly relates to the *Los Angeles wildfires* part of the claim.  The devastation is visually prominent.

* **Residential area:** The setting clearly depicts an affluent residential area, suggesting proximity to potentially high-profile individuals, vaguely linking to the ""Hollywood"" aspect of the claim.  However, there's no evidence linking it specifically to Diddy.

* **Absence of any evidence related to Diddy or a cover-up:** Critically, the image contains absolutely no evidence of any conspiracy or connection to Sean ""Diddy"" Combs.  There are no individuals, objects, or markings that could reasonably support such a claim.


The CLIP model likely made the ""Related"" classification due to the presence of wildfire damage in Los Angeles, fulfilling a part of the claim.  It associated the visual representation of the wildfire with the textual description mentioning Los Angeles wildfires. The model doesn't possess the ability to understand context or reason; it identifies visual and textual similarities based on its training data. The ""Hollywood"" connection is tenuous at best, based solely on the geographic location being an area associated with the entertainment industry.

The low similarity score indicates that the model is recognizing the limited connection. It's essentially flagging a superficial link: ""wildfires in LA"" matches part of the claim, but the rest of the claim (conspiracy, Diddy) has no visual support whatsoever.  The model is not making a judgment on the plausibility of the conspiracy theory; it's simply detecting a partial match based on keywords and visual elements.  In conclusion, the relationship is extremely weak and relies on coincidental geographic overlap and a lack of the model's ability to understand the context of the claim.

Let's break down why CLIP might have classified it as ""Related,"" albeit weakly:

* **Presence of Jill Stein:** While not explicitly stated, the image likely contains visual elements referencing Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate.  This is crucial because the claim directly names her. The presence of even a small, subtle image of Stein (possibly a logo, a photo, or even just text mentioning her name) would contribute to the ""Related"" classification.

* **Wisconsin Election Context:** The image may include visual cues related to the 2020 election in Wisconsin, such as maps, election results data, or imagery associated with the state.  This creates a contextual link to the claim, as Wisconsin is specifically mentioned.  The presence of election-related graphics (ballot boxes, graphs showing vote counts, etc.) would strengthen the connection.

* **Implied Narrative of a Close Election:**  Even without explicitly showing Stein's impact, the image might visually convey the narrow margin of victory in Wisconsin.  Images depicting close vote counts or maps highlighting contested areas could create an indirect association with the claim, suggesting a context where even small vote shifts could have influenced the outcome. This is an inference, and not a direct depiction of Stein's impact.

* **Lack of Direct Evidence:** The low similarity score indicates the absence of direct evidence visually linking Stein's candidacy to the loss of Wisconsin for Harris. The image probably doesn't show a direct causal relationship.  It's likely a collection of elements vaguely related to the claim, rather than a visual argument supporting it.

In summary, CLIP's ""Related"" classification with a low score (0.32) suggests a weak connection based on the presence of elements related to Jill Stein and the 2020 Wisconsin election, but lacking direct visual evidence supporting the claim that Stein cost Harris the election.  The image likely provides a general context for the claim but doesn't offer a visual argument for it.  Without seeing the image directly, this analysis is based on the common visual elements frequently associated with such claims.

Apparent errors in the audio are one clue the viral videos are fake. Instead of pledging to ""make our ties stronger,"" Trump’s voice says ""make out ties stronger,"" which doesn’t make grammatical sense. (It may have also been a typo for someone typing a script.)

Here's a breakdown of why CLIP classified it as ""Related"" with a low score:

* **Imran Khan's Arrest:** The image directly depicts the central figure of the claim, Imran Khan, and explicitly mentions his arrest. This forms the basic link to the claim, making it not completely unrelated. The claim centers around a promise to help Imran Khan get out of prison, and the image shows him *in* prison, thus establishing a relevant context.

* **Lack of Trump's Involvement:** The image contains no mention of Donald Trump, which is a crucial element of the claim.  The absence of any visual or textual reference to Trump significantly weakens the relationship.  The claim suggests a direct interaction or promise made by Trump, and the image provides no evidence of this interaction.

* **Specificity of the Claim:** The claim is highly specific, alleging a promise to help Khan regain power. The image only deals with Khan's arrest, not any subsequent events or external interventions that might support or refute the claim of Trump's involvement.

* **News Article Context:** The image is a screenshot of a news report about Khan's arrest.  While the news report might *indirectly* relate to the claim (by providing background context on the situation Trump's alleged promise would pertain to), it offers no confirmation or denial of Trump's involvement.

In summary, the low similarity score reflects the image's limited relevance to the core of the claim. The image establishes a context surrounding Imran Khan's arrest, which is relevant to the claim's subject matter, but it provides no evidence of the alleged promise by Trump. The connection is indirect and reliant on the viewer's pre-existing knowledge to bridge the gap between the image's content and the claim's assertion. The low score accurately reflects this weak and indirect relationship.

""The @DOGE team just discovered that FEMA sent $59M LAST WEEK to luxury hotels in New York City to house illegal migrants. Sending this money violated the law and is in gross insubordination to the President’s executive order,"" Musk said Feb. 10 in an X post. ""That money is meant for American disaster relief and instead is being spent on high end hotels for illegals! A clawback demand will be made today to recoup those funds.""
During the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump made a similar claim after Hurricane Helene hit the southeast U.S. in late September.
""$1 billion was stolen from FEMA to use it for illegal migrants,"" Trump said at the time. We rated that claim Pants on Fire! 
Like Trump’s, Musk’s claim is inaccurate. FEMA did not give money directly to New York hotels; it did give money to New York City. That move was neither illegal nor secretive. It was part of a program that Congress created and funded using money from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, not FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund, which is primarily used after natural disasters. The money did not fund luxury hotel rooms for immigrants.

Here are the facts.
FEMA has funded states and organizations that help migrants since Trump’s first term
Since Trump’s first administration, FEMA has given money to help state and local governments and nonprofit organizations that provide immigrants with basic services.
In 2019, as illegal immigration increased, Congress gave FEMA funding to expand its Emergency Food and Shelter Program to include migrant support services to immigrants  awaiting court proceedings. The program previously had been used only for people facing homelessness and hunger. 
In 2023, Congress directed U.S. Customs and Border Protection and FEMA to create the Shelter and Services Program for migrants, removing immigration grants from the Emergency Food and Shelter Program. The Shelter and Services Program uses money Congress has given Customs and Border Protection, and is administered by FEMA.
In fiscal year 2024, which started October 2023 and ended September 2024, Congress directed U.S. Customs and Border Protection to give FEMA $650 million for the Shelter and Services Program. 
Neither program was, or is, funded with money promised to FEMA’s disaster relief work. 
""The Disaster Relief Fund has nothing to do with any migrant assistance account because all that spending is from separate funds,"" Joshua Sewell, a federal budget expert at the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense, told PolitiFact in October 2024.

FEMA’s Shelter and Services Program website shows how much money state and local governments and nonprofit organizations have received from the program. However, the data is only updated through fiscal year 2024. In 2024, New York City’s Office of Management and Budget received $59 million.

The United States is the only country with unrestricted birthright citizenship.
By Samantha Putterman • January 21, 2025
The New York City’s mayor office told The Associated Press Feb. 10 that it received $81 million from the federal government the week of Feb. 3 in two payments — one for $59 million, $19 million of which went to direct hotel costs. The mayor’s office did not respond to our request for comment.
""This morning, my financial team shockingly uncovered that President Trump and his crony Elon Musk illegally executed a revocation of $80 million in congressionally-appropriated FEMA funding from New York City’s bank accounts late yesterday afternoon,"" Brad Lander, New York City’s comptroller said in a statement posted to the agency’s website. ""This is money that the federal government previously disbursed for shelter and services and is now missing. This highway robbery of our funds directly out of our bank account is a betrayal of everyone who calls New York City home."" 
New York City law requires the government to provide shelter to people who need it. According to a July 2024 comptroller report, the city spent an average of $156 dollars per night per hotel room. 
According to FEMA’s list of allowable expenses for the shelter program, hotel room costs ""should be reasonable based on the rate set by the U.S. General Services Administration.""
The U.S. General Services Administration sets the per diem rates for New York City hotel rooms at between $179 and $342 per night, depending on the month. Luxury, five-star hotels in New York City cost around $400 to $1,000 a night, according to a search on Expedia, a travel booking site.
Our ruling
Musk said ""The @DOGE team just discovered that FEMA sent $59M LAST WEEK to luxury hotels in New York City to house illegal migrants … That money is meant for American disaster relief.""
FEMA awarded New York City $59 million in fiscal year 2024. The money is part of a program that Congress approved to reimburse local and state governments and nonprofit organizations that provide basic services to immigrants. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection funds the program and FEMA manages it. None of the money comes from FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund, which is primarily used after natural disasters. 
New York City does not house migrants in luxury hotel rooms. In 2024, it spent an average of $156 dollars per night per hotel room, below the General Services Administration’s per diem rate. The city spent $19 million on hotel rooms.
We rate the claim False.",False,image_31.jpg,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/AP25043089627387/0dbe7f90757c7259ff0806ecf1027124.jpg,Unrelated,0.2291610091924667,"The Politifact image shows a FEMA representative, likely at a press conference or similar official event, speaking to reporters or cameras. The image itself contains no explicit mention of $59 million, luxury hotels in New York City, illegal migrants, or American disaster relief.  The focus is on a single individual in an official context.  There is no visual evidence linking this FEMA representative or the implied event to the specific claim about funding for migrant housing.

The CLIP model's ""Unrelated"" classification with a similarity score of 0.23 is entirely justified because:

* **Lack of Contextual Connection:** The image shows a generic scene involving a FEMA official.  It provides no specific information that corroborates or refutes the claim about the $59 million in funding.  The image is visually unrelated to the core components of the claim (money, hotels, migrants, disaster relief).

* **Abstract Nature of the Claim:** The claim itself involves financial transactions and policy decisions.  These are abstract concepts that are difficult to visually represent.  Images rarely directly depict monetary transfers or bureaucratic processes.

* **Low Visual Overlap:** There is no visual overlap between the image and the claim's components.  There are no visible signs of luxury hotels, migrants, or disaster damage.  Even the presence of a FEMA representative is not enough to establish a connection, as FEMA has many responsibilities beyond disaster relief.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The 0.23 similarity score reflects the minimal visual overlap between the image and the semantic content of the claim.  A score closer to 1.0 would indicate a strong visual match.

In essence, the image is a generic picture of a FEMA representative, while the claim makes a specific and detailed allegation about FEMA's financial activities.  The two are only tenuously related through the mention of FEMA.  The lack of concrete visual evidence supporting the claim leads to the appropriate ""Unrelated"" classification.  The low similarity score quantifies this lack of visual connection.

The image itself shows a woman in the process of voting.  Crucially, it shows *nothing* about the ballot itself.

Here's a breakdown of why the image is unrelated:

* **Absence of Ballot Details:** The most important factor is the complete lack of any visible portion of a ballot.  The claim focuses specifically on the *text* on the ballot – the allegedly misspelled name of Donald Trump. The image provides no information about the content of any ballot. We can't see the names of candidates, any potential misspelling, or even the type of election.

* **Generic Voting Scene:** The image depicts a generic scene of someone voting. It's a common stock photo-type image that could be used to illustrate voting in any election, anywhere.  There's nothing specific to Ohio, to Donald Trump, or to a potential misspelling.

* **Focus on the Voter, Not the Ballot:** The focus of the image is on the woman voting. Her actions are relevant to the general concept of voting, but not to the specific claim about a misspelled name on an Ohio ballot.

* **CLIP's Visual Analysis:** CLIP, as a multimodal model, analyzes the image's visual content.  It likely detected features like a person, a voting booth (partially visible), and possibly some generic voting paraphernalia. These features are related to the general concept of voting but don't align with the specific detail of a misspelled name on a ballot.  The low similarity score reflects the lack of visual overlap between the image and the claim's core assertion.

In short, the image is visually unrelated to the specific claim.  It shows the act of voting, but offers no evidence or visual corroboration concerning the alleged misspelling of Donald Trump's name on Ohio ballots.  The low similarity score reflects this disconnect accurately.

The relationship between this image and the claim ""Elon Musk is releasing a low-cost house"" is tenuous at best, explaining the low similarity score of 0.26 from CLIP.  The image provides absolutely no visual evidence supporting the claim.

Here's a breakdown of why the ""Related"" classification is weak:

* **Absence of Houses:** The image shows Musk speaking to an audience. There are no houses, building plans, architectural renderings, or any physical representation of a house, low-cost or otherwise.

* **Context is Missing:** The image itself offers no context regarding Musk's statements or activities at the town hall.  The claim could have been made outside the context of this specific event. Even if Musk *did* mention a low-cost house during this town hall, the image alone doesn't convey that information.

* **Generic Nature of the Image:** The image is a standard shot of a public speaker at a public event. It could apply to countless situations unrelated to the claim about a low-cost house.

* **Low Similarity Score:** The score of 0.26 reflects the weak connection. CLIP likely identifies the presence of Elon Musk as the primary link, but the lack of visual elements related to housing significantly reduces the overall similarity.  The relationship is based solely on the person in the image, not the content of the claim.

In conclusion, the ""Related"" classification is based on the presence of Elon Musk in the image, which is weakly related to the claim about a low-cost house.  The image itself offers no visual support for the claim, making the connection extremely indirect and circumstantial.  A higher similarity score would require visual evidence within the image connecting Musk to the act of releasing a low-cost house.

This claim is unproven and is the subject of a defamation lawsuit. A judge fined the person who originally made the claim $1,000 a day for failing to produce evidence to corroborate the allegation. That fine is currently on hold pending an appeal.
‘The Dominion guy’
On Nov. 9, 2020, nearly a week after Election Day, Colorado conservative activist Joe Oltmann claimed he had been able to listen in on an ""antifa conference call"" before the election during which a man named Eric from Dominion promised Trump wouldn’t win. Oltmann referred to him as ""the Dominion guy.""
""They're talking on this call and he responds, and I'm paraphrasing this, right. ... ‘Don't worry about the election. Trump is not going to win. I made effing sure of that. Ha ha.’ And everyone's like, ‘Yeah.’ And then somebody else responds ‘effing right,’"" Oltmann said on his podcast, the Conservative Daily.
Trump allies and pro-Trump cable news networks such as One America News and Newsmax  amplified Oltmann’s claim.
PolitiFact has found no credible evidence that Dominion’s machines affected any vote tallies, and our reporting found Dominion Voting Systems was used only in a few counties that experienced minor problems which were quickly resolved. Those problems were the result of either human error or temporary malfunctions. Republicans and Democrats who run elections also say there was no vote-rigging using Dominion systems.
Dominion Voting Systems was the subject of many debunked claims during and after the 2020 election. The company won a $787 million settlement against Fox News for repeatedly airing the false claims.
Coomer’s past anti-Trump statements
Coomer, who was Dominion’s director of product strategy and security during the 2020 election, did post anti-Trump comments on his Facebook page in 2016. Oltmann found the comments and aired them on his podcast.
""I don’t give a damn if you're friend, family or random acquaintance,"" Coomer wrote in one post. ""(If you) pull the lever, mark an oval, touch the screen for that carnival barker ... UNFRIEND ME NOW.""
Coomer told The New York Times in 2021 that the Facebook posts were authentic. But he said he never participated in an antifa conference call and never said the things Oltmann claimed he did.

Oltmann never offered evidence
Coomer filed a defamation lawsuit against OItmann and others who amplified the claim.
Oltmann has yet to provide evidence about the ""antifa conference call"" or how he gained access to the meeting. He has never provided details about the person who gave him access to Coomer’s private Facebook account, USA Today reported in September.
Oltmann also has yet to provide any evidence corroborating that Coomer said the things Oltmann has claimed.
A judge in the defamation case ruled in September 2024 that Oltmann owes Coomer $1,000 a day for as long as he continues to withhold evidence of his claims of election rigging, Colorado Politics reported. In October, the court agreed to put the fines on hold pending an appeal.
Newsmax also has retracted its claims about Coomer.
""Newsmax has found no evidence that Dr. Coomer interfered with Dominion voting machines or voting software in any way, nor that Dr. Coomer ever claimed to have done so,"" a 2021 Newsmax statement said.

There is no text visible, no recognizable individuals, and nothing that suggests an Antifa meeting, a Dominion Voting System employee, or anything related to the 2020 election results.

The low similarity score (0.25) reflects this lack of overlap between the image's content and the claim's subject matter. CLIP works by associating image features with textual concepts.  Since the image lacks any features commonly associated with political rallies, election fraud accusations, or even the individuals named in the claim, the model correctly identifies a weak or nonexistent relationship.  The image is essentially generic and visually uninformative concerning the claim.  It's a picture that could be taken in countless different contexts, none of which are connected to the specific events described in the claim.  Therefore, the ""Unrelated"" classification and low similarity score are justified.

Maudro se juramentó sin mostrar pruebas de que ganó las elecciones del 28 de julio 2024 contra el candidato de la oposición Edmundo González. González presentó actas electorales mostrándolo como el ganador de las elecciones venezolanas. Sin embargo, el Consejo Nacional Electoral de Venezuela, sin que se publicarán detalles de las actas electorales, proclamó a Maduro como presidente.
La posesión de Maduro ha sido criticada y sancionada por varios países, incluyendo Canadá, Reino Unido y Estados Unidos. 
En un comunicado del 10 de enero, el Departamento del Tesoro de Estados Unidos describe sanciones que la administración del Presidente Joe Biden impuso a funcionarios ""que permiten la represión por parte de Nicolás Maduro y la subversión de la democracia en Venezuela"".
Este también menciona que el Departamento de Estado ofrece hasta $25 millones por información que conduzca al arresto y/o condena de Maduro y de Diosdado Cabello, ministro de Interior, Justicia y Paz en Venezuela (hasta $25 millones por cada uno).

El 10 de enero, Mayorkas anunció la extensión del Estatus de Protección Temporal para Venezuela por 18 meses, la cual permite a venezolanos mantenerse en EEUU. La extensión es debido a una crisis bajo Maduro que ha llevado a altos niveles de crimen y violencia, impactando el acceso a alimentos, medicinas y otras necesidades básicas, según un comunicado del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional.

The claim, ""“El ejército de Los Estados Unidos se encuentra preparado para entrar a Venezuela a derrocar la dictadura de Nicolás Maduro” (The United States Army is prepared to enter Venezuela to overthrow Nicolás Maduro's dictatorship),"" directly relates to the potential for military conflict in Venezuela.

The CLIP model's ""Related"" classification with a similarity score of 0.28 suggests a weak but discernible connection between the image and the claim. The low similarity score indicates that the connection isn't strong, which is reasonable given the image itself doesn't directly depict US troops or imminent invasion.  The connection is made through indirect association:

* **Contextual Relevance:** The image represents the Venezuelan military, which is the target of the claim's assertion of potential US intervention.  The image shows the force that a US invasion would potentially encounter.  The presence of the Venezuelan military evokes the context of potential conflict.

* **Subject Matter Association:** Both the image and the claim revolve around Venezuela and its military situation.  They both deal with the political and potentially military climate within the country.  This shared subject matter is sufficient for CLIP to detect some level of relationship.

* **Lack of Direct Evidence:** The image lacks any explicit mention of the US military or any suggestion of an imminent invasion. There are no US flags, soldiers, or equipment visible. This lack of direct visual evidence explains the low similarity score.  The image doesn't visually support the claim; it simply relates to the overall context within which the claim is made.

In summary, CLIP likely classified the image as ""Related"" because of the shared thematic context of Venezuelan military forces and the political instability that makes a US intervention plausible.  The low similarity score accurately reflects the indirect nature of this relationship. The image depicts a potential target of the action described in the claim, but offers no visual evidence to support or refute the claim itself.

This is the primary reason why CLIP classified the image as ""Related"" to the claim ""Elon Musk: ‘I am officially buying McDonald's’,"" despite the relatively low similarity score of 0.35.

Here's a breakdown:

* **Central Theme:** The image directly addresses the core concept of the claim: Elon Musk's potential acquisition of McDonald's. The visual immediately communicates a connection between the two entities, even if in a humorous or satirical way.

* **Visual Metaphor:** The fusion of Musk and Ronald McDonald acts as a powerful visual metaphor. It playfully suggests a corporate merger or takeover, echoing the claim's assertion of Musk purchasing the fast-food giant.

* **Contextual Understanding:** CLIP's understanding relies on its training data. While the image isn't a direct representation of an official announcement, its inherent absurdity and clear connection to the claim are likely enough to register a degree of relevance. The playful manipulation highlights the unexpectedness of the scenario, aligning with the surprise and novelty associated with the initial claim.

* **Low Similarity Score Explanation:** The relatively low similarity score (0.35) suggests that while CLIP recognizes a connection, it also acknowledges the significant differences. The image is a manipulated piece of fan art or a meme, not an official photograph or document confirming the acquisition.  CLIP likely penalizes the score due to:

    * **Lack of direct textual evidence:** The image contains no text explicitly stating the claim.
    * **Humorous nature:** The manipulation's humorous tone might contribute to a lower score, as CLIP is trained on a diverse range of data and might not prioritize humorous interpretations.
    * **Artistic License:** The significant alteration of the original photographs reduces the image's literal similarity to the straightforward claim.


In summary, CLIP establishes a connection between the image and the claim based on the image's central theme—the visual representation of Elon Musk acquiring McDonald's—despite the image being a digitally altered, humorous representation rather than a factual depiction. The low similarity score reflects the lack of direct textual confirmation and the creative, rather than literal, nature of the image.
