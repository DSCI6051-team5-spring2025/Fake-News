# Fake News & Image Detection

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a system that detects fake news and images using real-time API data, MLOps, deep learning, and neural networks. It integrates both text and image analysis to detect fake content, leveraging news thumbnails or pictures as input for detection.

## Features

- **Fake News Detection**: Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify false information in text.
- **Fake Image Detection**: Detecting manipulated or fake images using deep learning models.
- **Real-time API Integration**: Fetches live data from news sources to analyze content in real-time.
- **MLOps Framework**: Streamlines model deployment, monitoring, and maintenance to ensure continuous improvements.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Real-time API integration
- MLOps tools (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes)
- Flask/Django (for API deployment)
